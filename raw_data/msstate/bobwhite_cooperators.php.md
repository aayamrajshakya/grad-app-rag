# Cooperators
The CP-33 Monitoring Program is a multi-state effort to evaluate response of bobwhite and other upland birds to CP-33 establishment. The financial support for this work is provided by USDA-FSA, USDA-NRCS-CEAP, and two consecutive grants through the AFWA Multistate Conservation Grant Program (Grants MS M-1-T and MS M-2 R), a program supported with funds from the Sport Fish and Wildlife Restoration Program and jointly managed by the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The CP-33 monitoring program could not have taken place without substantial investment of time, personnel, and resources by the many state agencies, universities, and non-governmental organizations. Your efforts are greatly appreciated.
