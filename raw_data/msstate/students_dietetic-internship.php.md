# Dietetic Internship
## Dietetic Internship
Become a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist. The Mississippi State University (MSU) Dietetic Internship (DI) and Master's (MS) program provides supervised practice experience in a variety of nutrition and dietetic practice areas in conjunction with an MSU master's degree in Food Science, Nutrition, and Health Promotion with a Health Promotion or Nutrition concentration. Interns usually complete the requirements for the DI and a master's degree within 23 months. 
The DI/MS program begins in July with a 5-week, 3-credit graduate Advanced Clinical Nutrition course, which is typically offered online. During your fall and spring semesters, you will take graduate courses in the evening while completing DI-supervised practice experiences Monday through Thursday and a Friday morning class. Your DI rotations offer a wide array of clinical health care, food service, community, sports, and education settings. You’ll work with the support of faculty and preceptors to acquire first-hand experience and broaden your understanding of dietetics. The DI/MS program offers you the choice of completing a majority of graduate degree coursework before the internship begins or finishing coursework and other graduate program requirements after you finish the internship. We encourage you to complete your graduate degree within 12 months of completing the DI. This will afford a minimal time gap between supervised practice and being eligible to sit for the RD exam. 
A DI/supervised practice option is available
The MSU DI/MS or DI only options are designed to lead to professional certification through the Commission on Dietetics Registration (CDR) of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics (AND). Students who complete the program are eligible to take the Registered Dietitian (RD) exam. After passing the RD exam, you’ll be ready to practice in a wide variety of employment settings, including health care, business and industry, community/public health, education, research, government agencies and private practice.

An original copy is maintained indefinitely by the MSU DI Program. The DI Director completes and submits the registration eligibility application to CDR via the online Registration Eligibility Processing System (REPS).

Board certification does not confer state licensure. Specific licensure requirements vary from state to state, and among territories. Licensure for the RD may also be required depending on the state of practice. The state of Mississippi requires additional state licensure for dietitians practicing within the state. Prior to beginning practice as an RDN Those seeking to become employed as RDNs can learn more about Licensure Statutes and Board Information by clicking on the link [state regulations](https://www.cdrnet.org/LicensureMap).
