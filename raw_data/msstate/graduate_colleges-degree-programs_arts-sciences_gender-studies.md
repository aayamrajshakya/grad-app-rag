Gender Studies is an interdisciplinary academic program that examines the construction of gender as a social, cultural, and psychological phenomenon and the various ideologies that underpin the distinctions that different societies over time have made between the categories of “man” and “woman.” As a field of inquiry, Gender Studies considers how gender as a social and cultural construction shapes people’s lives, their relationships, the workplace, institutional structures, public policy, and the production of knowledge. It also investigates the different impact of events, technologies, and government policies on men and women. The study of gender helps to broaden understandings of culture and identity, the intersection of gender with race, class, and sexuality, health and body politics, region and environment, nationalism, and citizenship.
The Gender Studies Certificate is awarded to students who complete 12 credit hours from the listed courses. The student may also petition the director for approval of another course.
