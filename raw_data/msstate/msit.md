  * The major professor is chair of the committee, must hold Level 1 or Level 2 Graduate Faculty status, and must be from the student's major department/program.
  * A limited number of Non-Graduate Faculty members may serve on a committee. Non-Graduate Faculty members are expected to have a graduate degree or commensurate expertise in the field of study. The decision regarding the qualifications of a Non-Graduate Faculty member to serve on a master's degree committee will be determined by the department/college.
  * In all cases where the committee consists of numbers above the minimum, greater than 50% of the committee members must hold Graduate Faculty status.
  * Non-Graduate Faculty committee members cannot serve as a major professor or committee chair.
  * Non-Graduate Faculty committee members can serve as a co-thesis director of the research along with a Level 1 or Level 2 member of the Graduate Faculty for students in a thesis-option program. If this occurs, it is expected that the Non-Graduate Faculty committee member will have education and research expertise commensurate with Level 1 or Level 2 Graduate Faculty.
  * The [Committee Request form](https://www.grad.msstate.edu/sites/www.grad.msstate.edu/files/inline-files/Committee_Request_Form_1.pdf) is submitted to the Graduate School.

The Dean will then decide if removal is necessary and accordingly inform the student, the committee member, the major professor, and the Graduate Coordinator.
