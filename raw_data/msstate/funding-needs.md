Dear MSU College of Education Alumni and Friends,
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your generous support to the College of Education at Mississippi State University during the past year. Your gifts each year help with scholarship support, trips for students to participate in conferences and competitions, faculty support, recruitment of new students and many other activities and opportunities within the college. 
This year we had a total of nine new endowed scholarships in the college: The Frank and Gayle Gallaher Loyalty Scholarship, Mary and Wendell Ladner Loyalty Scholarship, Dr. Peggy Slaughter Loyalty Scholarship, David and Peggy Tiffin Loyalty Scholarship, Vincent and Linda McGrath Kappa Delta Pi Endowed Scholarship in Education, Paul L. Lightsey Endowed Scholarship, Larry and Florence Box Endowed Scholarship, Amanda Catherine Richards Undergraduate Endowed Scholarship for Special Education and Dr. V. Clyde and Vashti U. Muse Endowed Scholarship. 
We had generous support from donors to the T.K. Martin Center for Disabilities and Technology, the Autism and Developmental Disabilities Clinic and the MS Writing/Thinking Institute’s Rural Voice Radio Program. National best-selling author James Patterson continued his support of teacher education by funding eight new scholarships in education making the number of James Patterson Teacher Education Scholars total 16.
As Mississippi State University continues its first ever $1Billion Infinite Impact Campaign, you have the opportunity to be a part of history with your gift to the College of Education. A gift of any size can help support students who will one day make local, national and global impacts on the world in which we live and learn. If you would like additional information about giving to the College of Education please contact me at 662-325-6762 or at tcunetto@foundation.msstate.edu. Please visit the college anytime you are on campus. We would love to see you!
The College of Education at Mississippi State University has a distinguished record of service to the state and nation and gains its strength through outstanding faculty and top students. We are dedicated to preparing highly qualified professionals both within the field of education and external to it. However, such goals are difficult in a period of limited state assistance for higher education. The support of loyal alumni and friends has enabled the College of Education to meet the demands of the 21st Century. We humbly ask for your continued help as we strive to make the college both bigger and better. The college is grateful for your support.
