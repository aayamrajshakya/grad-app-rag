# Human Development and Family Science
Department Head: Dr. Sheri L. Worthy Graduate Coordinator: Dr. Lori Elmore-Staton Graduate Coordinator for EI Program: Dr. Julie Parker 201B Lloyd Ricks Watson Building Box 9745 Mississippi State, MS 39762 Telephone: 662-325-0655 E-mail: JParker@humansci.msstate.edu
The School of Human Sciences offers both the Master of Science and the Doctor of Philosophy in Human Development and Family Science (HDFS) and a Master of Science in Early Intervention (EI). Students in the M.S. program in HDFS may select either the thesis or non-thesis option. The M.S. in EI is non-thesis only. Non-thesis students take a comprehensive oral exam in lieu of the thesis. Doctoral students must complete a research dissertation. Contact the Graduate Coordinator for more information regarding admission requirements and curriculum. Human Development and Family Science is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of individual and family development in a variety of contexts across the lifespan, from conception to later life. 
## Master of Science in Human Development & Family Science
### Admission Requirements
An applicant for the Master of Science in Human Development & Family Science degree must meet the following requirements:
  * Meet all MSU Graduate School requirements for admission
  * Have earned a baccalaureate degree in HDFS or a related field
  * Submit a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score competitive with other applicants
  * Submit three letters of recommendation, with at least two letters from individuals familiar with applicant’s academic work
  * Submit a sole-authored writing sample (see instructions below)
  * Submit a personal statement (500-1,000 words) describing the applicant's purpose for undertaking graduate study, including professional plans, career goals, and detailed research interests


For international, non-native speakers of English, a TOEFL or IELTS score indicative of ability to successfully complete graduate work is required. See English-Language Requirements in the Admission section of this publication for more information.
An overall undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 is preferred. Students admitted provisionally must fulfill Graduate School provisional admission requirements found in this publication. Qualified applicants for the HDFS grade program are expected to have interests and goals that are consistent with the department's faculty expertise and interests, as well as course offerings. Admission decisions are based on a holistic consideration of the applicant's credentials.
Instructions for Writing Sample: Applicants to the master's program are asked to submit a sole-authored writing sample in English so that the admissions committee may assess the candidate's ability as a writer, potential success in the master's program, and ability to do research and present it in written form. The minimum length of the sample is five pages, but the same should not exceed 25 pages. The sample should be presented in APA style (title page, headers, references, etc.). Examples of possible writing samples include, but are not limited to, papers from past courses, journal articles, or some written work product, such as a manual or technical report. 
## Master of Science in Early Intervention
The Master of Science in Early Intervention is framed by developmental, ecological, and family systems theories and evidence-based practices that emphasize the interactive nature of child development. The program will produce personnel with highly specialized skills and knowledge about critical assessment, intervention, and instructional programming, addressing the unique needs of infants, toddlers, and preschool children with disabilities or at-risk conditions and their families. The program will draw upon a range of approaches that acknowledge the central role of the family in a child's life with services provided in natural environments, i.e., home and community-based settings.
### Admission Requirements
An applicant for the Master of Science in Early Intervention degree must meet the following requirements.
  * Meet all MSU Graduate School requirements for admission
  * Have earned a baccalaureate degree in HDFS or a related field
  * Submit a Graduate Record Examination (GRE) score competitive with other applicants or hold a MS teacher's license
  * Preferably have an undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 
  * Submit three letters of recommendation, with at least two coming from individuals familiar with applicant’s academic work; letters should address the applicant's potential for successfully completing graduate work
