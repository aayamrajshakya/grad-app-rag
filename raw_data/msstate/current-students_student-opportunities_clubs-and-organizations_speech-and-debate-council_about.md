#  About the Council
The MSU Speech and Debate Council serves two functions, representing the university in intercollegiate speech and debate competition and promoting public speaking and debate on campus and in the community. Our members come from all segments of the student body, from freshmen to graduate students, encompassing a wide array of majors.
The Council was established in 2015 to carry on the traditions of previous speech and debate teams and organizations at Mississippi State University. We compete in individual and team debate under [International Public Debate Association (IPDA)](http://www.ipdadebate.info/about.html) rules, as well as all [American Forensic Association (AFA)](https://sites.google.com/site/afanietnew2/products-services/event-descriptions) individual events. For those new to forensics, these include multiple events in public speaking and dramatic interpretation, as well as limited preparation events like extemporaneous and impromptu speaking, so there really is something for everyone.

## Prospective Members
All MSU students are welcome to join the Council. Whether you have years of experience or are completely new to speech and debate, there is a place for you.
Remember that competition is optional. We also need members whose involvement focuses on our mission of promoting speech and debate on campus and in the community. So if your interest were, for example, planning and promoting Student Association debates or volunteering to teach forensics to high school students, we definitely have a place for you.
Expectations for Council members are straightforward. We expect all members to actively participate in general body meetings and service projects. In addition, we expect members who plan to compete to attend practice regularly and follow the coaches’ instructions to improve.
