##  Embedded Work-Based Learning   

Embedded Work-Based Learning (WBL) is a cornerstone of Mississippi’s Career and Technical Education (CTE) strategy, designed to bridge classroom instruction with real-world experience. Facilitated by the Research and Curriculum Unit (RCU), embedded WBL provides students with sustained, hands-on engagement in authentic workplace settings or simulated environments. These experiences align with academic standards and industry expectations, helping students develop technical skills, establish professional relationships, and enhance their career readiness.
To achieve the vision of a knowledgeable and skilled workforce, career development must begin as early as preschool and continue throughout one’s life. In Mississippi, this continuum provides exposure, instruction, and learning opportunities to help students understand the evolving academic and skill requirements of the emerging workplace, make informed decisions during career development, and become lifelong learners. The continuum includes grade-specific phases with activities that expose students to various engagement opportunities. 
As part of Mississippi’s career development continuum, embedded WBL falls within Phase 4: Career Training
By integrating embedded WBL into CTE programs, Mississippi empowers students to make informed career decisions, gain valuable experience, and transition confidently into postsecondary education or the workforce.
