# Postbaccalaureate Certificate Programs
A post-baccalaureate certificate is a stand-alone academic program beyond the bachelor’s degree that does not meet the requirements of a master’s degree. Students in post-baccalaureate programs must have completed a bachelor’s degree. Note: Students enrolled in post-baccalaureate certificate programs are not eligible for graduate assistantships.
