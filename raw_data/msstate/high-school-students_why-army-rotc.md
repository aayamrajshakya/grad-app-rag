Army ROTC is one of the nation’s top leadership development programs that also provides an opportunity to secure full or part-time employment after college. The U.S. Army Cadet Command selects, educates, trains, and commissions college students to be officers and leaders in the U.S. Army.
We work with cadets to help them succeed in the degree of their choice while earning a minor in Organizational Leader Development and earning a commission in the Active, Reserve or National Guard components. Through shared values, advanced training and experience, men and women can achieve their goals and gain an edge in their civilian careers. It also gives the Army added scale, scope and capability to adapt and respond to the Nation’s challenges home and abroad.
Benefits of the Army ROTC program include:
  * Leadership and management training that can be completed in conjunction with any chosen academic major.
  * Get training and one-of-a-kind experiences
