#  Online Graduate Programs
Adkerson School of Accountancy delivers online graduate classes that parallel on-campus classes, leading to the same graduate degrees in accountancy. Taught by MSU faculty, who have won awards for their innovative teaching, both the Online Master of Professional Accountancy and Online Master of Taxation programs are accredited by [AACSB](https://www.business.msstate.edu/about/accreditation "Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business")[ International](https://www.business.msstate.edu/about/accreditation "About MSU College of Business' Accreditation"), the most elite accreditation for business schools.
Each online program combines general, broad business and accounting education into a specialized curriculum designed to meet the greater demand for accountants, stemming from developments in information technology, increasingly complicated taxation and governmental control measures, and a growing awareness of the need for accurate control methods in existing businesses.
