Welcome to the College of Arts & Sciences at Mississippi State University. The College is the largest at MSU with over 5,200 students and over 325 full-time faculty members. Given its size, Arts & Sciences by itself would constitute the 5th largest university in the state.
As the heart and soul of MSU, Arts & Sciences serves every student who attends our great university. We provide all the general education courses, and we offer 27-degree programs, nine doctoral and 14 master’s programs in 14 departments.
The faculty in the college is a talented group of researchers and teachers who have earned advanced degrees from over 60 distinguished universities located in 37 states and 12 countries. Indeed, the faculty of the College of Arts & Sciences serves the people and the state of Mississippi through research that is innovative and internationally recognized and through award-winning teaching.
Clearly, the quality of a university's faculty defines its success and reputation in a competitive, international environment, and the results of their research and teaching are a resource for improving the quality of life for everyone.
