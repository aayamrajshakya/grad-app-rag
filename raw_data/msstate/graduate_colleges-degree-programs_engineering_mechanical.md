Website: [http://www.me.msstate.edu](http://www.me.msstate.edu/)
The Mechanical Engineering program offers graduate study leading to the degrees of Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering with a Mechanical Engineering concentration. Both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are available via BCoE Learning (online). The major areas of study include but are not limited to: fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, energy systems, thermal sciences, materials and manufacturing, mechanical design, and system dynamics. Specific programs of graduate study are established by consultation between students and their advisors. For further information contact the Graduate Coordinator, Mechanical Engineering Department, BOX 9552, Mississippi State, MS 39762 or gradcoord@me.msstate.edu.
## Admission Criteria
A minimum GPA of 3.00 is required for admission. An entering graduate student with a bachelor’s degree from a program that is not accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (EAC/ABET) must submit GRE general-test scores. An international student must have a minimum TOEFL score of 550 PBT (79 iBT) or IELTS score of 6.5.
## Provisional Admission
A provisional student must receive a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate level courses on his or her program of study taken at Mississippi State University (courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement) in order to be released from provisional status and achieve regular status. If a 3.00 GPA is not attained, the provisional student may be dismissed from graduate study. While in provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
For students enrolled in either the M.S. or Ph.D. program, all issues related to academic probation, dismissal and appeal will be governed by University policy, as approved by Graduate Council and the Provost and outlined by the Graduate School in the [Graduate Catalog](http://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/academic-policies/academic-requirements/).
## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates in the Mechanical Engineering Department are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program. This program permits students to earn up to 9 hours of graduate-level coursework during their final year of undergraduate studies. Students in the Accelerated Program take graduate-level courses and earn both undergraduate credit and graduate credit simultaneously. Students need to consult with the potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the graduate degree. Application to this program may be made as early as the junior year (i.e. after completion of 60 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). Students interested should see [Accelerated Programs ](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/)and contact the department's Graduate Coordinator, Dr. Tonya Stone, for more details.
