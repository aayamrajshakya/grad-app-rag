# MELO
## The MSU Mechanical Engineering Ladies Organization Promotes Female Success in ME
The MSU Mechanical Engineering Ladies Organization (MELO) seeks to help retain women in ME, to recruit high-achieving women into the school, to foster the success of women in ME, and to improve the sense of community among female students.
MELO is working to improve the percentage of women starting and completing a ME degree at MSU. MELO’s core objectives include mentorship of current students by female faculty, senior students, and alumni, outreach from MELO members to local schools, and social engagement of our female students.
MELO would like to see female enrollment in ME at MSU grow not only to meet national averages, but eventually to exceed these averages. This will require programs not only for local high school students, but also to generate interest in mechanical engineering among elementary-age students. An increase in female students will also aid the school in recruiting and retaining women.
MELO is proud to host Project ENspire, an engineering outreach program for 4th-6th grade girls. Find out more [here](http://me.msstate.edu/project-enspire).
For information about MELO please contact: Morgan Green, Faculty Advisor (green@me.msstate.edu).
