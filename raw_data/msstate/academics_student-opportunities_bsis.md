## Student Success
### [Haley Pritchard Quote I wanted a degree that gave me the freedom to explore more than one area of interest. Blending two disciplines means I’ve learned to look at situations from multiple angles. Whether it’s problem-solving, planning, or working with people, I can pull from different skill sets to find creative solutions.
