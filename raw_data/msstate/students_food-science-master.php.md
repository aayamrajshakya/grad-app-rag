# Food Science & Technology Graduate Studies
Students may pursue a master's in Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion with a concentration in Food Science and Technology. A Bachelor of Science in Food Technology, Food Science, or related areas will be considered to meet the prerequisites for study toward an advanced degree. Students from other disciplines may be required to take leveling courses generally not to exceed 15 semester hours.
The Master of Science in Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion with a concentration in Food Science and Technology requires a minimum of 30 hours of graduate credit (Including 6 hours of research/thesis), a research thesis, and a final defense. At least 12 hours of coursework must be taken at the 8000-level. Graduate assistantships may be available.

## Admission Criteria
  1. Baccalaureate (four-year degree) for entry into the M.S. program and 60 credit hours beyond a baccalaureate degree for admission to the Ph.D. program if a master's degree has not been earned.
     * Food Science and Technology concentrations require a 2.75 GPA but a 3.00 is preferred. Typically, a 2.75 GPA requires provisional admittance.
  

     * English proficiency is required for non-English speakers. Some international students may be exempt based on country of origin.   
  

> TOEFL Paper-based score: 550 or better  
>  TOEFL Internet-based (iBT): 79 or better  
>  IELTS: 6.5 or better
  2. Contingent admission may be granted on the recommendation of the Graduate Faculty and Graduate Coordinator. The following criteria apply:
     * Contingent admission may be allowed when an applicant meets the regular admission requirements but scores less than the minimum on any English proficiency tests. Contingency is dependent upon taking one semester of English as a Second Language (ESL course) followed by a technical writing course at Mississippi State University. Successful completion of both will result in regular admission status once proof is received by the Graduate School.
  

     * Contingent admission may be allowed when an applicant has a borderline academic background that may require leveling courses to strengthen the overall academic foundation of the applicant.
  

  3. Provisional admission may be granted to an applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University for regular admission. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's Program of Study, as prescribed by advisor. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall be dismissed from the graduate program. Academic departments may set higher standards for students to fulfill provisional requirements; a student admitted with provisional status should contact the graduate coordinator for the program’s specific requirements. While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
