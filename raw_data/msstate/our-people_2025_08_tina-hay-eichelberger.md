For Tina Hay Eichelberger, a lifelong love of animals led to a career that has taken her from hands-on veterinary practice to an integral role with Mississippi State College of Veterinary Medicine’s diagnostic labs in Pearl. 
She began her education in Hinds Community College’s veterinary technician program.
“It was a one plus one program,” she said. “You spent your first year at Hinds, and then you came to Mississippi State and went through clinical rotations at the vet school.” That hands-on experience, combined with passing her boards, launched her into 12 years of private veterinary practice. 
But after more than a decade in the fast-paced world of clinics, Eichelberger was ready for a new chapter. “Private practice is tough on your body and on your time. You eventually realize you have to transition into something more sustainable,” she said. That transition brought her to CVM’s Diagnostic Laboratory Services, where she now serves as the lab coordinator for both the virology section and Chronic Wasting Disease, or CWD, testing. 
Her work plays a vital role in animal and herd health across Mississippi and beyond. “During CWD season, from October to March, I handle testing for the entire state and Tennessee. It’s an incredibly busy time,” she said. Outside of that window, she focuses on viral diagnostic testing for a wide range of species: bovine, equine, canine, and feline. From heartworm and feline leukemia to herd testing for bovine leukemia and Johne’s disease, her department supports veterinarians and producers with high-quality diagnostics that they may not be able to perform in-house. 
Though she doesn’t interact directly with animals in the lab, Eichelberger’s connection to them remains strong. “I’ve worked for vets all my life,” she said. “That passion has never gone away.”
Outside of work, Eichelberger is just as dedicated to the things that matter most: her family, her animals and the outdoors. A native of Port Gibson, she now lives in Forest with her husband, who also works at the CVM lab front desk. “He retired and was looking for something to do—I said, ‘Why don’t you work here?’ So, he did!” she said with a laugh. 
Back home, Eichelberger’s compassion continues. She and her husband care for five dogs and two cats, most recently a dog and three puppies she rescued on the side of the highway. “They’re not staying permanently,” she said, “but I couldn’t just leave them.” 
Whether in the lab, at home, or helping an animal in need, Eichelberger brings energy, compassion, and experience to everything she does. “It’s been a journey, but I love where I've landed.”
