### Provisional Admission
Provisional admission is typically not available to students applying for graduate admission to the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering.
### MS in Chemical Engineering 
The program of study of a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering degree includes advanced courses in Chemical Engineering (12 hours), Mathematics & Statistics (6 hours), and elective courses selected based on student’s career goals and interests. The MS program includes thesis option and courses-only (non-thesis) option. Students develop their program of study in consultation with the major professor and graduate committee.
### Engineering PhD in Engineering with Chemical Concentration
The program of study for a PhD in Engineering with Chemical Engineering concentration includes completion of 56 (post BS degree) or 33 (post MS degree) credit hours in advanced courses in Chemical Engineering (12 hours), Mathematics & Statistics (6 hours), elective courses based on student’s research interests (6 hours), and significant scholarly research (20 hours), presented in the dissertation. Students develop their program of study in consultation with the Major Professor and graduate committee. Direct PhD admits would have an option to earn at MS degree upon successfully completing course work (non-thesis) and thesis (thesis-option).
At least 50% of all courses must be at the 8000 (full graduate) level. Furthermore, 50% of courses must be taken at MSU and all thesis/dissertation hours must be taken at MSU.
## Academic Performance
The Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering is committed to maintaining high standards for the graduate programs offered by the school. As a means to ensure satisfactory performance of all graduate students enrolled in the school, the guidelines for unsatisfactory performance are below:
  * Failure to maintain an overall B average (3.00) in graduate courses attempted after admission to the program
  * More than two grades of C in graduate level courses
  * A grade of D or F in a graduate level course
  * Failure of the qualifying exam
  * Unsatisfactory evaluation of a thesis or a dissertation
  * Failure to maintain an overall B average (3.00) in prerequisite undergraduate courses
  * Official withdrawal from school due to academic difficulties


All students are expected to adhere to these standards. Failure to do so will result in the following actions by the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering.
  * A student who fails to maintain an overall B average in graduate courses will be given one semester to bring up her/his overall GPA in graduate level courses. If the student currently holds an assistantship from the school, said assistantship may be terminated. The student will be placed on probation for one semester. The graduate level courses taken during this probationary semester must be part of the graduate student's program of study and should constitute a full load. Failure to attain an overall B average in graduate courses at the end of this probationary semester will result in dismissal from the graduate program.
  * A student who earns more than two grades below a B, or earns a D or F in any graduate level course will be dismissed from the graduate program of the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering.
  * A student who officially withdraws from school during the semester due to academic difficulties will be dismissed from the graduate program of the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering.


### Appeals Process
A student who is dismissed on the basis of academic performance from a graduate program offered by the Dave C. Swalm School of Chemical Engineering may appeal the decision. The appeals procedure is as follows:
  * A student may appeal his/her dismissal from a graduate program by submitting a letter of appeal to the Appeals Committee. This letter should contain a detailed explanation of the circumstances leading to his/her dismissal (identified as one of seven points listed in academic performance policy) and should explain any extenuating circumstances leading to failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress.
  * The Appeals Committee shall be composed of the following five members: 
    * Director of the Swalm School of Chemical Engineering
    * Graduate Coordinator of Chemical Engineering
    * Major professor for the student
    * A professor from another department within the College of Engineering (asked to serve by the Director and/or Graduate Coordinator of Chemical Engineering)
    * Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies for the College of Engineering
  * The Appeals Committee will review the provided documentation and reach a consensus decision on whether to uphold or overturn the dismissal. If the appeal at the program level is unsuccessful, the student may then appeal to the college dean. If the appeal at the college level is unsuccessful, the student may then appeal to the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.


## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified chemical engineering undergraduates (minimum grade point average of 3.5 or higher) in the Swalm School of Chemical Engineering are encouraged to apply to the Accelerated Program. This program permits students to earn up to 15 semester credit hours of graduate-level coursework during their final year of undergraduate studies (or, in exceptional cases, in the junior year, where the student has an exemplary academic record and meets all course prerequisites--e.g. in split-level 4000/6000 graduate courses). When completed successfully, the student will earn both undergraduate and graduate credit simultaneously. Students must meet with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the graduate degree. See [Accelerated Programs ](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/)for complete information.
In addition to University requirements, Chemical Engineering also requires the following:
  * A minimum of 60 hours toward the completion of the chemical engineering degree
  * A statement of professional interests and goals


In exceptional cases, where the above criteria are met mid-way through the junior year, the student may take split-level (i.e. 4000/6000) courses in the second semester of the junior year. 8000-level courses are reserved for students in the senior year after completing the equivalent undergraduate course (e.g. CHE 4134 Chemical Reactor Design taken in a fall semester followed by CHE 8123 Chemical Kinetics and Dynamics taken in the last semester of the senior year).
Students interested in applying to the Accelerated Chemical Engineering Program should contact either the School Director, Dr. Bill B. Elmore or Dr. Dong Meng for more details.
