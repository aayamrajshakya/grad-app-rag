# Student Life
##  Finding Balance  
Life outside the classroom
At MSU CVM school is top priority, but we are well aware of the importance of our students having a life outside of the classroom. The years our students spend with us are filled with some of the most challenging, but rewarding experiences of their lives, and we are committed to offering the programs and services needed to help them navigate and enjoy their time at MSU CVM.
###  Involvement  
Student Leadership & Organizations 
MSU CVM offers several opportunities for students to get involved in leadership roles as class leaders. The CVM also offers an array of student organizations that meet the needs of people and animals.
Student leadership and organizations provide a great way for students to participate in decision-making within their class and have an impact in the community while earning their degree.
