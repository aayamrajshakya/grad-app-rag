# Dual Degree
  

The dual degree program is a combination of the two majors of landscape architecture and landscape contracting and management. Students choose this option to broaden their career opportunities and advance faster in the profession. Mississippi State University is the only program in the nation to integrate landscape architecture and landscape contracting curricula to offer a dual degree program. The dual degree is a five-year program that combines the business, horticulture and construction sides of the four-year landscape contracting program with the design and construction aspects of the four-year landscape architecture program.
