# Software Engineering
Software Engineering is the study of systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. It combines principles of computer science with engineering practices to create reliable, effective, and scalable software. Courses involved in this major encompass topics such as software requirements analysis, software architecture and design, programming methodologies, quality assurance, project management, and many others. Students gain experience in mathematics, algorithms, and systems programming, as well as the tools and processes used in modern software development environments. Software Engineering graduates are prepared for careers in software development, software architecture, quality assurance, project management, and related roles in industries ranging from technology and finance to healthcare and defense. We also offer a minor in software engineering for students in other majors.
