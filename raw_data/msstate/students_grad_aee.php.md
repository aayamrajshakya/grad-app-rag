## Master of Agriculture (non-thesis, available on campus and [online](https://www.online.msstate.edu/magaee)) 
The Master of Agriculture degree is a non-thesis advanced degree designed to prepare graduates for careers or professional schools. Students develop a program of study with approval of the student’s graduate committee in accordance with Graduate School policy and course requirements for the concentration.
Students are required to complete 30 hours of coursework as approved by the student’s graduate committee. Some Directed Individual Study courses, numbered at the 7000-level, may be approved to meet 8000-level course requirements. Not more than 6 hours of graduate credit may be earned in Directed Individual Study courses. Students will also complete a scholarly project focused on their career goals and subject area. The student must pass the final defense of a scholarly project and complete an oral comprehensive examination over all coursework completed. This program is offered through [MS State Online](https://www.online.msstate.edu/magaee).

Students should be aware of the Graduate School policy on grades and degree completion. A graduate student cannot graduate with 1) a GPA lower than 3.00 for all courses attempted for graduate credit after admission to the degree program, or 2) a grade of D or lower for any courses attempted for graduate credit after admission to the degree program, or 3) a grade of I on their transcript (see the Graduate Catalog).
The following outlines qualiﬁcations for admission into the MAg program with a concentration in Agricultural and Extension Education. Pay particular attention to the required documents for admission into an AEE graduate program.
