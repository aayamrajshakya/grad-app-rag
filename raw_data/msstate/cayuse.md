Cayuse 424 is an electronic research administration system that serves as a proposal development tool and submission portal to Grants.gov. Researchers can now use Cayuse 424 to search and download funding opportunities, develop their proposals, and establish routing chains for proposal approval prior to submission by Office of Sponsored Projects. Cayuse 424 is a convenient, user-friendly interface that provided auto-filling of university and faculty profiles, and interactive error checking as the proposal is developed.
The Cayuse 424 support [website](http://support.cayuse.com/docs/cayuse-424-support/user-reference-manual) offers robust training modules that are available to MSU employees. If you would like to organize an individualized training session for your department, please contact the Office of Sponsored Projects at aor@osp.msstate.edu.
