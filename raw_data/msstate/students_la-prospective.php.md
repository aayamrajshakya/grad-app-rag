# Landscape Architecture
  

The profession of landscape architecture offers students the opportunity to engage in shaping the environmental and cultural landscape through planning and design to improve quality of life. The Mississippi State University Landscape Architecture programs teach the artful synthesis of social and ecological processes related to planning, designing, building and managing regenerative communities in Mississippi and the Northern Gulf Region, within a global perspective. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (BLA) program experience an immersive, intense, and rewarding education structured around a studio environment that promotes critical thinking and creative problem solving. The department is dedicated to providing a high-quality education for our students, through small class sizes and one-on-one interaction between student and faculty. The BLA program is the only accredited bachelor of landscape architecture degree program in the three state region of Alabama, Mississippi, and Tennessee.
