The Department of History offers programs leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Fields for the master’s degree are: United States, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Africa, and World. Fields for the PhD. Degree are: United States and Europe. A student may choose a minor field of study outside the History Department with concurrence of their advisor. Not all of the fields listed above are available for dissertation research or as the major field for a Master of Arts degree.
## Admission Criteria
The History Department expects an applicant to have either an overall GPA of 3.00 or a GPA of 3.00 in the last two years of undergraduate study. The prerequisite for admission to a graduate program in history is a minimum of 18 hours of undergraduate history courses; for a graduate minor in history, 12 hours of undergraduate history courses are required. Ph.D. applicants are strongly encouraged to submit the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and must submit a writing sample with their application packet to The Graduate School. Applicants who received the M.A. in History from MSU are not required to take the GRE. Examples of acceptable writing samples are publications, chapters from a thesis, or a seminar paper.
An international student intending to pursue a graduate degree in history must meet all regular requirements and, in addition, present a Test of English as a Foreign Language score of 550 or higher. This requirement does not apply to international students with degrees from an American institution nor to students from countries where English is the primary language. The applicant should understand that the History Department uses the statement of purpose as a major factor in making admissions decisions. It is to the applicant’s advantage to take special care in completing this statement. The applicant should add additional pages to the statement of purpose if necessary. To facilitate the selection of an advisor the applicant should explain their field(s) of interest in the statement of purpose. An applicant whose quantitative credentials meet the stated criteria may still be denied admission because of qualitative factors. Normally, applicants will receive an admission decision within 30 days after the receipt of all required materials by the department.
### Application Deadlines
Grad Application Deadlines Semester |  Date  
---|---  
Fall Semester | April 1  
Spring Semester | November 1  
Teaching Assistantships (fall semester only) | March 1  
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
### Contingent Admission
An applicant lacking an adequate background in history may be granted contingent admission and be required to take additional courses at the undergraduate level.
## Academic Performance
Although one C grade may be included in a graduate program, the History Department views C grades as evidence of unsatisfactory work. A student who earns a second C grade will be dismissed from the program. Students earning one grade of D or F will also be dismissed from the program. A candidate for degree must have achieved a B average by the end of the coursework.
## Diversity Certificate Program
The Diversity Certificate Program seeks to teach workplace success by providing the multi-cultural knowledge and skills necessary to navigate among a diverse workforce. At the heart of this post-baccalaureate program is the demand that students learn and think critically about race, race relations, ethnicity, social class and inequality, religion, and gender. This requirement will produce employees who have the necessary sensitivity and understanding to accept important leadership challenges and to advance themselves and their workplace.
Its methods are straightforward. Each student seeking a certificate must take at least one of two courses from each of four distinct fields: History, Sociology, Gender Studies and African American Studies. Students are free to take more than the minimum number of courses; however, the program an intense immersion in one course from each area will enhance understanding sufficient for business persons to achieve objectives most sensibly and expeditiously.
The choice of these four fields is deliberate and precise. History will enable students to learn the various forces, activities and trends leading to the present day world; history grants perspective. Sociology will explore and explain the interactions among and between diverse peoples in the present day; it explores social dynamics. Both African American and Gender Studies offer a more multivariate approach. Borrowing from a number of disciplines and specialties, they offer an interdisciplinary, multicultural perspective, revealing numerous, tangible intersections among institutional sexism and racism, power relationships, economic allocation and self and group actualization.
Together, these four fields create a tightly woven package that will make a true difference both in the students who take the courses and the workplaces in which they operate. Each of the courses has a similar approach using classic writings, great thinkers and pertinent events as well as analysis and understanding of those whose voices in social settings remain obscured. Each utilizes the most recent information and insight to fashion an acute demonstration of how multicultural knowledge and understanding is essential to successful functioning in all aspects of the modern world.
### Admission
Applicants must be graduates of accredited undergraduate institutions and be admitted by The Graduate School either as a degree-program or unclassified graduate student. Students wishing to apply for the certificate program must submit a writing sample explaining how they plan to use the Diversity Certificate in their careers. This document is required from degree-program and unclassified graduate students and must be submitted directly to Dr. Alan Marcus. International students must obtain a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 625 PBT (106 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 8.0 or better.
### Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates are encouraged to apply to an Accelerated Program which permits enrollment in graduate courses while still an undergraduate. See [Accelerated Programs](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/). 
In addition to the University requirements the Department of History also requires the following.
  1. Undergraduate students may apply to the Accelerated Program once they have accumulated 60 hours of graded coursework and 15 hours of graded coursework in history. Applicants must have maintained a 3.5 GPA in both their cumulative undergraduate coursework and their coursework in history. Admission is contingent upon the student completing [HI 3903](https://catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=HI%203903 "HI 3903") with a grade of B or better. The initial application will be to the History Department. 
  2. Applicants must submit a completed graduate application form, a statement of purpose for graduate study, transcripts, and at least two letters of recommendation from history faculty members. The application deadlines for this program are November 1 and April 1. 
  3. All applications will be reviewed at the start of the semester for which the student has been admitted into the program; students whose GPA has fallen below the minimum requirement or who have failed to complete [HI 3903](https://catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=HI%203903 "HI 3903") with a B, will be removed from the program. 
  4. If a student intends to apply for this program he or she should meet with the graduate coordinator during the advising period prior to the semester for which the student intends to apply for admission to select the appropriate courses. The student must apply to the Graduate School for regular admission into the graduate program during his or her last year of enrollment as an undergraduate.


Interested students should also refer to the Master of Arts Degree for Accelerated Program Students section under Programs of Study.
## Master of Arts Degree Program of Study
The History Department offers the Master of Arts degree with an emphasis in United States, European, Latin American, African, Asian, or World History. A student may choose between a thesis and a non-thesis degree program. Each student will choose a primary and a secondary area of emphasis. The primary area of emphasis will be drawn from one of the following subject areas: United States, European, Latin American, Asian, African, or World History. The secondary area of emphasis for a thesis student will be drawn from either another one of the above subject areas, or a topical field related to a particular region or historical phenomenon. Students can minor in a field outside of history; a minor outside of history must include at least nine semester hours. 
A degree candidate with a thesis must also demonstrate proficiency in one research skill which may be either reading proficiency in a foreign language or proficiency in quantitative methods or some other relevant research skill as determined by the student’s graduate committee. The non-thesis program is designed for students planning to enter secondary education or who want to develop a broad understanding of history for a variety of other reasons. The secondary area of emphasis for a non-thesis degree candidate must be drawn from a geographic region other than the one the student has selected for the primary field. The non-thesis program does not require a research skill.
Each student must have a graduate committee composed of three graduate faculty members who will oversee the student’s progress toward the M.A. degree and conduct a written comprehensive examination and an oral defense of it at the conclusion of the student’s graduate studies. At least two of the committee members must be members of the History Department’s graduate faculty. If a minor from outside the department is selected, one member must be from the minor area of study.
Each master’s degree candidate will complete a comprehensive examination at the completion of graduate studies. The examination will cover both primary and secondary fields and will be taken at a time and in a format determined by the student’s graduate committee. The student choosing the thesis option will also be expected to provide an oral defense of the thesis at the conclusion of her/his graduate studies.

#### Program of Study as an Undergraduate
In the course of completing the requirements for the student’s undergraduate degree the student may enroll in up to 9 hours of graduate courses which will count toward both the student’s undergraduate degree and the M.A. in history. These courses can be at either the 6000 or 8000 level, and the student should enroll in them for graduate credit. Once the graduate course has been completed, the student and advisor will apply to the Registrar to have the course count for undergraduate credit. Once this application is granted, the course will appear on the student’s undergraduate transcript. A split-level course will appear as the 4000-level equivalent of the 6000-level course. An 8000-level course will appear on the student’s transcript as a 4993 Special Topics course with the same name as the 8000-level course. The student may opt out of the program at any time and complete a regular undergraduate major in history. Once the student has opted out, however, no further courses will be allowed to count for both graduate and undergraduate credit.
Registration for a graduate course requires the undergraduate student to complete the Undergraduate Request to Enroll in Graduate Courses(s) form. The student can access the form at <http://www.grad.msstate.edu/forms/pdf/accel.pdf> and must submit the completed form to the Graduate School. The Graduate School will inform the student by email when he/she can register for the graduate course.
The student will receive the bachelor’s degree after the requirements for that degree have been met. On completion of the degree the student will be admitted into the regular graduate program provided the student has received no grade lower than a C in any course taken for graduate credit and not received more than one C in the courses taken for undergraduategraduate
#### Program of Study for the Student’s Post-Baccalaureate Year
In the student’s post-baccalaureate year he or she will be expected to complete either the thesis or non-thesis degree program. Students who do not complete the program by the end of the summer following their first post-baccalaureate year will be automatically transferred into the regular M.A. program.
## Doctor of Philosophy Degree
The History Department offers the Ph.D. degree with a primary emphasis in either United States or European History. The student will choose a primary field of emphasis in either United States History or European History. Students are required to prepare for examination in four fields of emphasis. Two fields of emphasis will be chronological fields within the primary area of emphasis (U.S. or European). A third field of emphasis will be drawn from the department’s four core areas (International Security and Internal Safety, History of Science and Technology, Agricultural, Rural, and Environment History, or Race, Identity, Gender, and Region). The final field of emphasis will be a topical or regional field or in a discipline other than history. Fields of emphasis outside of the History Department must include at least 12 hours. The student should refer to the History Department’s list of available fields of emphasis for more information. Each student must hold a bachelor’s degree from an appropriately accredited institution of higher learning and possess qualifications indicating ability to do graduate work on a doctoral level, as determined by the department’s Graduate Committee.
The department expects that the student will normally complete at least 60 hours of coursework (40 classroom hours and 20 research hours) beyond the bachelor’s degree for the Ph.D. degree in history. Credit earned in a master’s degree program at Mississippi State or up to 20 credit hours earned elsewhere may be used to satisfy requirements for the doctoral program if it is appropriate to the candidate’s doctoral fields and acceptable to the student’s graduate committee. Each student pursuing the Ph.D. degree in history must demonstrate proficiency in at least one research skill by the end of the fourth semester of his or her enrollment in the program. This requirement may be fulfilled by demonstrating a reading knowledge of a foreign language or by demonstrating proficiency in another research skill appropriate to the student’s field of study. Each candidate is required to complete, or have completed, [HI 8923](https://catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=HI%208923 "HI 8923") at Mississippi State and two research seminars. Each student is also required to select a specialization in one of the History Department’s four core areas: 
  * International Security and Internal Safety, or
  * History of Science and Technology, or
  * Agricultural, Rural, and Environmental History, or
  * Race, Identity, Gender, and Region

Chosen in consultation with the student’s graduate committee. 
The prospective doctoral candidate must understand that work toward a Ph.D. is different from other academic work they may have undertaken. The holder of a doctoral degree is assumed to have mastered their field of study and to have developed an ability to do original research and to make original contributions to knowledge. It is the responsibility of the student’s major professor and committee members to determine when this level of understanding has been reached. It cannot be measured by the number of courses completed, and the exact amount of coursework required of each student in the History Department may vary.
Each student must have a graduate committee composed of at least four graduate faculty members. The chairman must be from the student’s major field of emphasis and must be a full member of the graduate faculty. That individual will normally be the student’s future dissertation director. The committee will include a second reader, who will assist the dissertation director, and at least two other members. Four members of the committee must be members of the History Department’s graduate faculty.
When the student and their major professor agree that adequate preparation has been made, the major professor will schedule a comprehensive examination. Full-time Ph.D. students should normally take their comprehensive examinations within three years of enrollment, and part-time Ph.D. students should take their comprehensive examinations within four years of enrollment. The student must have either completed all coursework or be within 6 hours of completing the coursework. The student must have fulfilled the research skill requirement and must have met all other History Department and Graduate School requirements. Each student will take four written comprehensive examinations. Students will be allowed one day for each field, and the four examinations must be completed within a two-week period. Faculty members who have collaborated in preparing a student for a particular field of emphasis may contribute to one examination. The student’s committee will then decide if the quality of the written examinations warrants proceeding to the oral examination. If a student fails either the written or oral part of the comprehensive examination, she or he may retake it after the passage of four months. A second failure will result in termination from the program.
After passing comprehensive examinations, the student must submit a dissertation proposal which must be approved in writing by all members of the student’s graduate committee before the student will be admitted to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation proposal must include at least the topic, historical question to be answered, hypothesis answering that question, and sources to be consulted. The dissertation proposal must specify both the director and the second reader. No candidates will be granted a dissertation fellowship until the approved dissertation proposal is on file in the History Department office.
The composition of the candidate’s graduate committee for the dissertation need not be identical to the committee which conducts the comprehensive examination. The second reader of a dissertation will be actively involved in the dissertation process. The second reader will be kept informed of the progress the candidate is making in the research and will comment upon drafts of outlines and chapters as the candidate writes them.
The dissertation must show the candidate’s mastery of research methods in history and must make an original contribution to scholarship in the candidate’s field. The dissertation must reflect at least 20 semester hours of dissertation research. The candidate’s graduate committee must approve the dissertation and administer a final oral examination (defense). The dissertation must be provided to the members of the committee at least fourteen days before the defense.
