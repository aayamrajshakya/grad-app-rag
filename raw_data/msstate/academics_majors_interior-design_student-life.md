#  Life as an Interior Design Student 
Studio learning is a unique experience, and the Mississippi State University Department of Interior Design provides a supportive environment for personal growth and professional development. 
One big advantage of studio learning is it allows for more students to have more one-on-one time with professors.
Mississippi State interior design students have access to a variety of specialized facilities and tools to help them succeed in their studies: printing and plotting labs, the Bob and Kathy Luke Library (college-specific material), a woodworking shop, a 3-D printer, a CNC router, and more.

Field trips are an integral part of the Mississippi State University Department of Interior Design curriculum, allowing students to explore and experience design in large metropolitan cities. The observations and experiences from field trips cannot be replaced by library research or reports. Recent trips include Chicago, Illinois; and New York, New York.
