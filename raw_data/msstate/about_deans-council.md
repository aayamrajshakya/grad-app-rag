#  Dean's Council
In the fall of 2018, MSU CVM former Dean, Kent Hoblet announced the initiation of nineteen distinguished members to the first-ever CVM Dean’s Council. The council was established to assist the dean in key areas of promotion, growth, and sustainability of the college by providing strategic advice regarding vision, direction, and long-term planning of the college, as well as assisting in acquiring resources from private, corporate, state and federal levels and assisting with the student recruitment efforts of the college.
In addition, the council serves in an advisory capacity for the marketing and public relations efforts of the college and as an advocate of the college to university administration, the State of Mississippi, and as appropriate, on a national level.
  
  
The Dean's Council consists of Dr. Mark Akin, Dr. Rebecca Burcham, Dr. Mikell Davis, Dr. David Dale, Dr. Robert Filgo, Dr. Emily Feeman, Dr. Susan Harper, Dr. Greg Howell, Dr. Todd Henderson, John Lewis, Dr. Rebekah List, Dr. Taylor Lyne, Karen McCord, Mike McCormick, Dr. Matt McGee, Dr. Paula Schuerer, Dr. Kevin Smith, Lynn Spruill, Dr. Wanda West, Wayne Wilkerson, Lauran Wingo, and Dr. Jared Yates.
The Mississippi State College of Veterinary Medicine Dean's Council gathered for its annual fall meeting Oct. 10-11, 2024. The group received updates on the Gulf Coast Aquatic Health Lab, CVM Animal Health Center, veterinary medical technology program, DVM admissions process, and development efforts. The Council also participated in a roundtable workshop with the college's communication team and had the opportunity to meet DVM students Gabbi Walters and Natalie Garcia, inaugural recipients of the Huddleston Rural Veterinary Scholarship.
On April 24-25, the group returned to CVM for its annual spring meeting, where they participated in a planning session focused on the college's new Rural Veterinary Certificate program and received updates on the Mississippi Veterinary Research and Diagnostic Laboratory System, CVM Enhanced Clinical Practicum program, and marketing and communication endeavors. They also had the opportunity to meet new CVM faculty.
The council gained six new members this fiscal year. Dr. Rebecca Burcham, a donor and friend of the college from Nashville, TN; Dr. Emily Freeman, a donor and friend of the college from Carmel, IN; Dr. Susan Harper from Shepardstown, WV; Dr. Matt McGee, a 1994 graduate of the college and owner of Corinth Animal Care Center; and Dr. James Yates, a 2020 graduate of the college and veterinarian with Tupelo Small Animal Hospital. The presidents of the Mississippi Veterinary Medical Association, West Virginia Medical Association, and MSU CVM Alumni Council will now hold permanent positions on the Dean's Council, along with the president of the Mississippi Farm Bureau Association.
Selected by the dean in consultation with his senior leadership team, council members serve five-year terms (with the initial group serving staggered terms to avoid complete turnover), and the council chairman serving a two-year term. The council meets in the fall and spring each year, and members can be reappointed indefinitely by mutual agreement between them and the dean.
