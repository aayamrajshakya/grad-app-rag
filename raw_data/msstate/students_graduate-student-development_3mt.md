**What is 3MT****®****?**
3MT® is a competition that challenges graduate students to present a compelling verbal presentation of their thesis or dissertation topic and its significance in just three minutes. 3MT® develops academic, presentation, and research communication skills and supports the development of graduate students' capacity to effectively explain their research in language appropriate to a public audience.
**3MT® is not an exercise in trivializing or ‘dumbing-down' research but forces students to consolidate their ideas and crystalize their research discoveries.**
Students compete by presenting their thesis/dissertation topic in three minutes or less. Competitions are judged by a panel comprised of a group of professionals (academic and non-academic) with a wide range of expertise. The program is the thirteenth annual event at Mississippi State University in Fall 2025.
**Why participate in 3MT®?**
By competing in the 3MT® competition at Mississippi State University, graduate students have the opportunity to sharpen their communication skills, promote their field of research to the campus and the general public, and help all people understand the importance of research and how it positively impacts their lives. Winners will be provided cash prizes including:
  * Grand Champion: $400
  * Grand Champion Runner Up: $300
  * People's Choice Award: $200
  * Remaining Finalists: $100


The 2025 3MT Grand Champion will represent Mississippi State University at the Regional 3MT competition at the Conference of Southern Graduate Schools in Baton Rouge, LA from February 18-20, 2026.
Registration is open October 1st to November 3rd.
