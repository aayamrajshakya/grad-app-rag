# Course Numbering Information
All course numbers consist of four digits. The first (left) digit indicates the level of preparation required and the fourth (right) digit indicates the number of semester hours. The two middle digits are reserved for the departments to distinguish one course from another. If the fourth digit is zero (0), this means that credit is variable and will be set in consultation with the professor. For example, [ACC 4000](https://catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=ACC%204000 "ACC 4000") Directed Individual Study could be a 2- or 3-hour course.
Courses that are in close sequence, such as two semesters of a survey course or a sequence of numbers for a seminar in a particular field, may be listed with a hyphen (-) between the two four-digit numbers (e.g., AGN 8711-8731 Seminar).
When the same course is offered on both undergraduate and graduate levels, two numbers are used to designate the two levels of credit (e.g., EN 4333/6333 Southern Literature). Students enrolled for graduate credit will be required to complete assignments above and beyond those students enrolled for undergraduate credit. A graduate student who took a split-level course as an undergraduate cannot take the same course for credit on the graduate level.
The following course numbers, 4990, 6990, and 8990, designate Experimental Courses and will be used for no more than two years unless an extension is granted.
Grad Course Numbers Course Numbers | Level of Credit  
---|---  
1001-2999 | Lower division courses (Undergraduate credit only)  
3001-4999 | Upper division courses (Undergraduate credit only)  
4001 | Directed Individual Study (Undergraduate credit only)  
5001-5999 | Fifth year undergraduate or Professional courses  
6011-6999 | Courses for graduate credit only  
7011-7999 | Courses for graduate credit only  
8011-8999 | Courses for graduate credit only  
9011-9999 | Courses for graduate credit only  
7000 | Directed Individual Study (Graduate credit only)
