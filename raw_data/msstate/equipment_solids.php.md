### Solids Analyzer
RSA-G2 Solids Analyzer  
  
The RSA-G2 is an advanced platform for the mechanical analysis of solid materials, incorporating advanced technology to deliver precision and versatility. The RSA-G2 supports various experimental techniques, including creep and recovery, stress relaxation, stress and strain rate ramps, iso-strain, iso-force, fatigue, multi-wave, arbitrary waveform, and dielectric thermal analysis. Furthermore, the RSA-G2 also functions as a Dielectric Thermal Analyzer (DETA), offering both standalone and simultaneous measurement capabilities. Features include independent stress and strain measurements, temperature control, high-speed electronics and data processing, and a camera viewer.
