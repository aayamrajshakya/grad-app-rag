##  We Welcome the Opportunity 
We love to work with companies interested in our [available technologies](https://msstate-innovations.technologypublisher.com/). Please contact us directly whenever a specific technology need arises by calling our office at [662-325-9263](tel:662-325-9263) or [e-mailing](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/contact) us.
Most University technology is in the early stage of development and successful commercialization requires a reasonable development effort to bring the products to market. In some cases this is best done with a start-up company whose primary goal is to develop the embryonic technology. In other cases, more established companies are best able to commercialize the technology.
Our standard [License Agreement](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/sites/www.otm.msstate.edu/files/2018-12/nonequity.doc) for established companies provides exclusive or non-exclusive commercial rights in exchange for an up-front fee, reimbursement of patent costs, and a royalty on sales. In some cases, a [Non Disclosure Agreement](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/sites/www.otm.msstate.edu/files/2023-03/Non-Disclosure%20Agreement%20Procedure.pdf) or [Material Transfer Agreement](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/inventors/material-transfer-agreements) may be necessary to provide sufficient information for the company to evaluate the technology. If a longer time is required, an [Option Agreement](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/sites/www.otm.msstate.edu/files/2018-12/optionlicense.docx) may be necessary. All forms can be found on the [Industry Forms](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/industry/forms) page.
For start-up companies, a small equity stake may be taken in lieu of the up front-fees. Details are provided in the section [Entrepreneurs](https://www.otm.msstate.edu/entrepreneurs).
