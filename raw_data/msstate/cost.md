The Cost of Attendance (COA) determines financial aid eligibility and includes both direct and indirect costs. Direct Costs (Tuition/Fees, Housing, and Food), are billed by the university and may be charged to the student. Indirect Costs (Books, Transportation, and Personal), are not billed but are factored into the COA to reflect the full cost of attending college.
**Beginning Fall 2025: Enrolled hours over 16 are assessed additional overload tuition and non-resident fee (if applicable) at the prevailing per-credit-hour cost. Capital Improvement and Student Activity Fees are capped at the per semester cost. [Tuition and Fee Information](https://www.controller.msstate.edu/accountservices/tuition)
**The Bulldog Book Bundle can be either a Direct or Indirect Cost. Undergraduate students are automatically enrolled, making it a direct cost, but if they opt out, book expenses become an indirect cost as they must purchase materials separately. [Learn More](https://www.msstate.edu/bulldogbundle)
