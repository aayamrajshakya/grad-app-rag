The Department of Agricultural Economics offers a degree program leading to the Master of Science in Agriculture with a concentration in Agricultural Economics. This program stresses thorough mastery of advanced economic theory, methods of quantitative analysis, and the applications of these methods to the problems of agriculture. The broad program of economic research conducted by the department affords a wide selection of areas from which the student may choose a specific problem for research.
The Master of Science in Agriculture with a concentration in Agricultural Economics program is designed for the student to begin graduate coursework in a fall semester; thus, the student must submit application materials prior to July 1. However, graduate research assistantship decisions are usually made in February, and admission to the program must be obtained before an assistantship may be granted. Students are encouraged to apply by February 1. For additional program information, please visit the department’s website at [www.agecon.msstate.edu](http://www.agecon.msstate.edu/).
## Admission Criteria
