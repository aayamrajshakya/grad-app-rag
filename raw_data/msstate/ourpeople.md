## GRI Employee Spotlight
####  Paige McCraine 
Title:   
Time at GRI:   
Hometown:   
  
Q: What is your academic background?  
I graduated from Mississippi State with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.   
  
Q: What are your research interests?  
My research mainly revolves around uncrewed systems integration and operation using both commercial & custom designed components. Platform wise I have focused on an amphibious ground robot and uncrewed surface vessel.   
  
Q: Who inspired you to pursue the career you have today?  
I always enjoyed learning how things worked growing up. Between working around the family farm, 4-H activities, and school activities it seemed like the obvious choice.   
  
Q: What has been your favorite project while working at GRI?  
It’s hard to pin one specific project as my favorite. The component I enjoy the most is thinking through the process flow for each project and accounting for platform/sensor requirements, integrating them appropriately, while also trying to keep a level of simplicity. I find it highly satisfying to see the transition of conversations into 3D models to printed prototypes to a functioning system supporting project deliverables.   
  
Q: What is the coolest thing you are working on right now?  
GRI has two SeaTrac SP-48 USVs. These two platforms are incredibly capable systems collecting water quality data that can be used to better understand the waterways within our state.   
  

#####  WORKING AT GRI IS QUITE UNIQUE. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE RESEARCH INTERESTS IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY THAT CAN ULTIMATELY MAKE HUGE IMPACTS ON OUR ENVIRONMENT. NO TWO DAYS ARE ALIKE AND I’M ALWAYS LEARNING SOMETHING NEW! 
Q: What is something most people don’t know about you?  
I enjoy reading novels probably more than watching tv.   
  
Q: What kinds of hobbies and interests do you have outside of work?  
I like to dabble in lots of different hobbies. My favorites are probably gardening, anything sourdough, and snowboarding!
