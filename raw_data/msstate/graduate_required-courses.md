##  Graduate School Required Courses   

##  Performance and Course Retake Policy   

A student may retake a course, but only one retake is allowed while in the program. Both grades will be included in the GPA calculation. No more than one grade of D or F is allowed on all graduate courses taken while in the program. A retake is not allowed if this occurs. 
No grade D or F is allowed on a used course (by CAPP) and no more than two grades of C or lower are allowed on all graduate courses taken while in the program. 
##  New Students   

A student is expected to take the one hour credit course, PH 8111: Seminars and Colloquia, in each semester of the program. The course is focused on presentations of original research studies related to various research areas in the department. It is given by experts in their fields and required to be completed in each semester that the student is in residence at MSU.
##  MS - Thesis Option   

Minimum of 24 graduate course work credit hours (8 courses). Minimum of 6 credit hours of thesis research (PH 8000).
### Required courses
  * PH 8233 Methods of Theoretical Physics I
  * PH 8743 Quantum Mechanics I


and any 2 of the following 3 courses:
  * PH 8213 Mechanics
  * PH 8243 Methods of Theoretical Physics II
  * PH 8313 Electromagnetic Theory I


##  MS - Non-Thesis Option   

Minimum of 30 graduate course work credit hours (10 courses). Research hours not required.
### Required courses

  * PH 8743 Quantum Mechanics I
  * PH 8753 Quantum Mechanics II


Highly recommended course:
  * PH 6333 Electromagnetic Fields II


##  PhD   

### Required courses
  * PH 8213 Mechanics
  * PH 8233 Methods of Theoretical Physics I
  * PH 8243 Methods of Theoretical Physics II
  * PH 8313 Electromagnetic Theory I

Courses taken at MSU in the MS program may be used again in the PhD program.
Minimum of 20 credit hours of dissertation research (PH 9000).  
Minimum of 24 graduate course work credit hours (this includes the 18 hours of required courses).   
An additional 10 graduate credit hours is required, which may be any combination of dissertation research (PH 9000) and course work credit hours.
