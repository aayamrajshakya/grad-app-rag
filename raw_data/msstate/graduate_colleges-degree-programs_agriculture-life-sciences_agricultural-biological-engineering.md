## Admission Criteria
Prerequisites for admission into the graduate program include all the general requirements of the Graduate School and identification of a departmental professor who is willing to serve as research director for the master’s or Ph.D. project. International students must obtain a TOEFL score of 550 PBT (79 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 6.5 or higher. Exceptions to these requirements are considered on a case-by-case basis and require approval of the Department Chair.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
Unsatisfactory performance in the graduate program in Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering is defined as any of the following:
  * Failure to maintain a 3.00 average GPA in attempted graduate courses after admission to the program
  * A grade of U, D, I, or F in any one course
  * More than two courses not exceeding 8 credit hours with a grade of C
  * Failure of the research defense
  * Unsatisfactory evaluation of a thesis
  * Or failure of a required component of the program of study


Any one of these, or a combination of these, will constitute the basis for review for possible dismissal. The graduate coordinator will review the record, along with the student’s graduate committee, and take a final course of action which will be immediate dismissal or the establishment of a probationary period in which corrective action must take place. Appeal of dismissal can be made by submitting a written appeal statement to the department head. If the dismissal is upheld by the department upon the student’s appeal, the student can then submit a written appeal to the dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
The Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering also offers the Master of Science degree in Biosystems Engineering and Doctor of Philosophy degree in Engineering; both programs are housed in the College of Engineering. See program information in the James Worth Bagley College of Engineering section of this publication.
## Accelerated Program
The goal of the accelerated B.S./M.S. Program in the Department of Agricultural & Biosystems Engineering (ABE) is to enable highly qualified students to earn up to 12 hours of graduate course credit during their final year of undergraduate studies. Students will complete graduate level courses (6000-level) and receive dual credit for the equivalent undergraduate course (4000-level). Students must apply and be admitted to an accelerated program prior to enrolling in the graduate level classes. Interested students must consult with the Graduate Coordinator to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the graduate degree.
For admission, the student must:  
1.) Be enrolled at Mississippi State University in Biological or Biomedical Engineering.  
2.) Have completed a minimum of 90 credit hours of undergraduate coursework  
3.) Have an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher for all undergraduate work
Students interested in applying to the Accelerated Program should contact their academic advisors or undergraduate coordinator.
