##  Curriculum 
Practical studio experience builds competency in design theory; the specification of interior materials and finishes; lighting, universal design, and computer-aided design; building and life safety codes; historical interiors; professional practices; interior construction and furniture design; space planning and programming; and graphic and verbal communication skills.
As students progress through the Mississippi State University Department of Interior Design, they acquire an ability to identify, analyze, and create solutions using critical thinking and spatial comprehension in solving design problems in the built environment.
### Portfolio Review
A portfolio review is required for our students and takes place the summer between their second and third year in the program. The portfolio review will consist of original work from art foundation courses and interior design foundation courses. Students must have a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher and a 2.5 in the interior design major core. Students will have two opportunities for portfolio submission.
### Senior Portfolio and Exhibit
Each senior is required to submit a professional portfolio for faculty review and provide work for a senior exhibit in the spring of their senior year.
### Internship
As a component of the curriculum, interior design students complete a three-month internship. The internship occurs in the summer following their third- or fourth-year in the program. These internship experiences immerse students into the profession of interior design, offering them opportunities to participate and contribute to national and international projects. This project participation and mentoring by design professionals prepares students to easily transition into permanent employment, resulting in Mississippi State University interior design graduates consistently being 100% employed.
