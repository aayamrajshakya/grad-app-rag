##  A Purposeful Education 
Thinking and making establish the cornerstone of our education as hands-on, project-based learning in studios operates as the core of our curriculum. Our education is conceived as four general areas of study:
  * Design
  * History and Theory
  * Technology
  * Professional Practice


The Bachelor of Architecture degree is designed to be a five-year degree for students enrolling in ARC 1536: Design I-A in the fall semester. For transfer students enrolling in ARC 1536: Design I-A in the summer, the degree is one summer (two summer sessions) and four years.
Students spend their final year of studies in this five-year program at our Jackson Center studios, located at 509 East Capitol Street.
