#  Controlled Substances in Research
Controlled substances are drugs that are regulated by the [Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/ "DEA") and the [Mississippi Board of Pharmacy](https://www.mbp.ms.gov/ "Mississippi Board of Pharmacy") because of potential for abuse. DEA regulations and Board of Pharmacy rules allow investigators to obtain and use controlled substances in research. Mississippi State University (MSU) researchers who obtain, store, and utilize controlled substances in their research MUST   
  
  
  
Prescription or Legend Drugs are defined by the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy as drug which is required under federal law to be labeled with either of the following statements prior to being dispensed or delivered: (1) “Rx Only” or (2) "Caution: Federal law restricts this drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian"; or a drug which is required by an applicable federal or state law or regulation to be dispensed on prescription only or is restricted to use by practitioners only. All persons using these drugs in research MUST   
  
  
  
Furthermore, all investigators must use pharmaceutical grade drugs (prescription drugs or controlled substances) in animal research, unless an exception is specifically approved by the MSU Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC).
## Instructions for Researchers
All researchers who will use Controlled Substances in a non-clinical setting must have a DEA Certificate of Registration to do so. Prior to registration with the DEA, you will need to first register with the Mississippi Board of Pharmacy. 
The process to obtain a DEA registration is easy to initiate and our office is happy to assist, but approval may take up to 6 months during normal activity and as long as one year with slower processing times.
Once a license is obtained, you will need to complete a Controlled Substances Registration form (listed below) and email it to Jess Marshall, jmarshall@orc.msstate.edu. Your completed registration will be kept on file in the Office of Research Compliance & Security (ORC&S). 
To dispose of Controlled Substances, a Controlled Substances Disposal Form (listed below) will need to be completed and submitted to ORC&S, who will provide further instructions on the disposal process. For a full description of this process, you may refer to the Disposal of Controlled Substances SOP found below.
