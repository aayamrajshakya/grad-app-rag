# Graduate Studies
An advanced degree in Animal and Dairy Sciences can afford you numerous career opportunities. Many companies involved in animal agriculture are seeking individuals who bring the experience of advanced coursework and the ability to conduct and interpret research to their businesses. 
In addition to jobs in the animal feeding, breeding, production, and health management industries, an advanced degree in Animal and Dairy Sciences can also give you an advantage in the basic and molecular sciences.
Graduate students in Animal and Dairy Sciences can choose to obtain a Master of Science degree, a Master of Agriculture degree, or a Doctor of Philosophy degree. In all options, students will work closely with a major professor in their field of interest, gaining knowledge and experience.

## Master of Science in Agriculture with a concentration in Animal Science
The Master of Science in Agriculture with a concentration in Animal and Dairy Science curriculum is based on a total of 30 credit hours. This option requires a thesis. The student must have completed or will be required to complete in addition to the graduate coursework, 9 credit hours (4000 or above) of animal/dairy sciences courses. These 9 credit hours must include at least one course in breeding, nutrition, or reproduction and at least one course in a species-specific production system. All students are expected to demonstrate a working knowledge of the Animal and Dairy Sciences field. Opportunities to meet this expectation include: audit additional animal sciences courses (below 4000 level), serve as a teaching assistant for Introduction to Animal Science, or attend departmental journal clubs. Students not holding a degree in animal or dairy sciences (or related field) will be required to do at least one of the above, as directed by the major advisor. Any undergraduate courses would not be included in the program of study.

## Research Ideas
GENETICS 
Research is conducted in both quantitative and qualitative genetics at the cellular and whole animal level with the goal of improving livestock production. 
PHYSIOLOGY 
Research is conducted in the areas of reproductive, stress, growth, lactation, and exercise physiology. Students work to understand how managing physiology can impact animal production and efficiency.
MEAT SCIENCE
Research is conducted to gain knowledge in food safety, meat quality, and muscle biology, all to increase the production of safe, quality, wholesome muscle food products. 
NUTRITION
Research is conducted to understand how feedstuffs affect growth and performance, how increased management of forages can improve profitability and how by-product feeds can be incorporated into animal diets.
