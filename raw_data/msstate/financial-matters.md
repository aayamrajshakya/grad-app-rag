# Financial Matters and Scholarships
## In-state tuition for everyone?
That’s right. It’s one of the main perks about choosing an online program at Mississippi State – whether you live in Mississippi or somewhere else!
Tuition and required fees are charged on a per credit hour basis at the prevailing rates as determined by the Institutions of Higher Learning, the governing board of the University. These rates are applicable at the time of publication and are subject to change without notice.
You can access the [Tuition and Fees](https://www.controller.msstate.edu/accountservices/tuition/) page and then click on the Online Education tab for more information.

## Financial Aid
You have a desire to learn and improve your opportunities by getting a degree, but perhaps you just don’t have the funding for school right now. Financial aid is available if you qualify. The video below will explain how to apply.

## Scholarships
Mississippi State has a variety of scholarships available to help offset the cost of your education. Scholarships may be based on need, academic performance or service. If you’re a candidate for a scholarship you may begin the general application process here. Follow these basic steps:
  1. Have you been admitted to the university yet? If not, use the [undergraduate admission](http://www.apply.msstate.edu) and [graduate admission.](https://apply.grad.msstate.edu)
  2. Once admitted, log into your myState account using your NetID and NetPassword that you received in the mail after acceptance.
  3. A new window will pop up, and you’ll need to log in again using your NetID and NetPassword. (Yes, we realize this is a little redundant!) When you log in the first time, you’ll need to complete the general application. Don’t forget to hit the “Save” button so you’ll be able to return to your stored info later.
  4. After you’ve submitted your general application, we encourage you to check in regularly. Additional opportunities may be recommended to you over time based on your GPA, leadership, service and record. You wouldn’t want to miss out on something that important.


Do you have questions about any of this? The [Office of Admissions and Scholarships](https://www.admissions.msstate.edu/) can help, 662.325.2224.
