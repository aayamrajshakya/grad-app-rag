# Plant Pathology
Plants are important to everything we enjoy about life. They feed us, oxygenate us, heal us, shade us and clothe us. Everyone needs plants. But sometimes even plants need a doctor. Plant pathologists study the diseases and disorders of plants including fungus, virus, and bacteria. This concentration is perfect for someone with a green thumb and an investigative spirit. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes191013.htm): Plant pathologists are categorized as soil and plant scientists by the U.S. Department of Labor. Plant pathologists need a bachelor's degree for entry-level positions. Soil and plant scientists could expect a 7% job growth rate from 2019 to 2029. The median annual wage for plant pathologists was $66,120 in May 2020.
