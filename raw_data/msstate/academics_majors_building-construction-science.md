##  Overview 
The Department of Building Construction Science at Mississippi State University is designed to prepare students for careers in construction and construction-related fields. The studio-based program is one of just two programs of its kind in the nation, and it is [accredited by the American Council for Construction Education (ACCE).](https://www.caad.msstate.edu/our-difference/accreditation/building-construction-science)
Students will graduate with a Bachelor of Science degree and will be able to manage construction projects and the business of construction. They are expected to be decision makers and managers in their work environment. The department consistently has a 99% employment rate, with the other 1% continuing with graduate studies.

##  Curriculum 
Students in the department solve problems as construction professionals in a simulated office environment called a “studio.” In studio, students are challenged to integrate classroom knowledge and skills to solve problems on construction projects. Coursework includes collaborative team projects, hands-on building projects, construction site visits and tours, and integrated cross-disciplinary work with design students in architecture and interior design. Practicing construction professionals are frequent visitors to the studios and participate in student project reviews each semester. 
Students study a general foundation of mathematics, science, and business. Construction-specific courses include construction systems, building technology, structures, materials and methods of construction, estimating, scheduling, health and safety, construction and project management, financial management, and construction law. 
Students learn how to use industry-standard computer software and use building information modeling (BIM) through all four years of the curriculum.
