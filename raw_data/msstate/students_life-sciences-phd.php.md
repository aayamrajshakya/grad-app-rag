## Admission Criteria
Final acceptance into a graduate program is contingent upon the availability of a suitable major professor.
  * A bachelor’s or master’s degree in a physical or life science with a strong background in the program discipline of interest (biochemistry, molecular biology, entomology, or plant pathology).
  * A minimum 2.75 overall GPA on a 4.00 scale.
  * Scored results of the GRE general test recommended but not required.
  * International students are required to have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 500 PBT (61 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 5.5 (non-English speaking international students)


Provisional Admission:
