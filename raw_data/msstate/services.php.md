# Service Center
## Services Provided by IGBB Staff
In addition to its role as an independent research institute, the IGBB also functions as a multipurpose service center. Specifically, the IGBB provides a series of low-risk "standard" genomics, proteomics, and computational services to MS State scientists and external users. These IGBB Standard Services are performed on a fee-per-service basis. Standard service fees are designed to recover costs (i.e., not make a profit) and are all-inclusive (i.e., contain personnel, reagent, and other direct costs) unless noted otherwise. Indirect costs (45.5% of total direct costs) are charged to external (non-MS State) users, but not to MS State employees. The IGBB's standard services and internal and external user fees are described in our...

Standard services can be requested and inquiries about standard services can be made by contacting one of the IGBB [Research Leads](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/leads.php).
## Use of IGBB Equipment by Individuals Not Employed By the IGBB
If you wish, you can have your trained employees use select equipment at the IGBB Laboratories to advance your research program. "Self-Service Equipment Usage" can be requested by contacting one of the IGBB [Research Leads](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/leads.php). Note that most instruments require training (see [Service Center Catalog](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/services_catalog.php)) and may have usage fees to offset machine operation costs (e.g., wear and tear, reagent costs, and portion of service contract).
With a few exceptions, we recommend that scientists employ trained IGBB staff members to operate IGBB equipment. This ensures high quality and prevents investigators from being liable for equipment damage.
A listing of IGBB Service Center items and their prices -- including information and prices for Training and Self-Service Equipment Usage -- is available in our...
