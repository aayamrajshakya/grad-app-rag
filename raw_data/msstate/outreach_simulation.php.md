# Simulation and Decision Support
* * *
Simulation models allow engineers to perform sophisticated “what-if” analysis on their systems without disrupting the real system or prior to implementation of a new system. Simulation models are scalable to fit almost any size problem and flexible enough to fit any application or industry including manufacturing, healthcare and service. The models allow you to analyze the impacts of layout changes, inventory rules, resource allocations, product mix, changes to batch sizes, rules and policies, schedule and/or sequence of production and much more.
Decision Support technologies focus on developing software to help improve and accelerate decision making. These technologies incorporate complex simulation models, math models, and optimization algorithms into an easy-to-use application. These applications allow all levels of personnel to utilize the power of these engineering tools without requiring them to build and maintain the tools.
Simulation and Decision Support activities are led by Travis Hill, Chase Saunders and Adam Collins, Certified FlexSim consultants, with over 30 years of combined experience.
