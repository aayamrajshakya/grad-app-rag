Students accepted (by faculty evaluation) into the fine arts, graphic design, or photography concentration may begin the concentration sequence of courses. Students denied may remain in the art program as an “Art-Undeclared (UART)” major and can resubmit a portfolio in the next review. Students cannot pursue a concentration in which they have been denied twice. They will have to choose another concentration in order to pursue a BFA at Mississippi State.
Contact the Department of Art for more information.
