The International Business (IB) program caters to high-achieving students who enjoy travel, culture, business, and learning a new language. Graduates from the IB program typically complete their studies in five years and earn two degrees—each designed to cover a separate aspect of living and working internationally:
  * A Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in international business and a focus in a specific discipline such as accounting, marketing, finance, economics, logistics or management.
  * A Bachelor of Arts with a major in a foreign language, such as Spanish, German or French (offerings in Mandarin Chinese and Japanese are also available).

## International Business Internships
Before graduation, IB students must complete an international internship in which they work abroad, or work for a U.S. company conducting significant international business for a minimum of 10 weeks. The internship will be ideally reflective of the student's specific business discipline and language proficiency area, but will ultimately be dependent on the student's own initiative, qualifications and interest.
In the past, our IB students have interned with Fortune 100 companies in the United States, as well as multinational companies in Amsterdam, Beijing, Brussels, Bucharest, Dublin, Grenoble, Hong Kong, Madrid, Mexico City, Paris, Quebec, San Jose, Santiago, Singapore and Stuttgart. Recent internship placements include:
  * CitiGroup
  * FedEx
  * International Paper
  * Garan
  * Freeport-McMoRan
  * Deloitte & Touche
  * Siemens
  * U.S. Embassies abroad

## Study Abroad
No international education is complete without practical exposure to other people’s cultures. The hallmark of Mississippi State’s IB program is its emphasis on real cross-cultural immersion, both academically and in a real-world business context. Studying abroad provides students with an invaluable opportunity to expand their horizons and gain new perspectives on the world, while developing intercultural communication and problem-solving skills that teach independence and strong confidence.
All IB students will study abroad for either a summer or for a regular semester term after their 4th year, for a minimum of six weeks. Experience in the language of study is encouraged, but not required. Students may elect to participate in formal exchange programs with our partner institutions in Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, South Africa, Spain and Taiwan or they may elect to design their own study-abroad experience with input and assistance from their advisor.
