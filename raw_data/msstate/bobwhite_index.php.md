# What is CP-33?
  * In 2004, the United States Department of Agriculture-Farm Service Agency (FSA) established conservation practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds, or CP-33, under the Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
  * CP-33 aims to provide habitat for northern bobwhite and other upland birds via landowner incentives to establish native grass buffers along row-crop field margins. 
  * CP-33 is a "win-win" for producers—it allows retirement of unproductive field margins, often with net financial gains through practice incentives, while providing critical habitat for quail and other upland wildlife.
