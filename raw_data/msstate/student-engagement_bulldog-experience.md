# Bulldog Experience
Bulldog Experience, our university quality enhancement plan, gives students a chance to make meaning from a unique learning process. From courses to internships, students can make the most of their time at MSU and be recognized for it, too. Bulldog Experience is focused on expanding the experiential learning activities offered at MSU by increasing both faculty-created activities and co-curricular, or outside the classroom, activities. Students are encouraged to reflect after participating in these activities to create new knowledge and apply it to their futures.
