# Kinesiology
Department Head: Dr. JohnEric W. Smith Graduate Coordinator: Dr. Adam Knight  
299-9 Morrill Road  
Mississippi State, MS 39762  
Telephone: 662-325-2963  
Website: [kinesiology.msstate.edu](http://www.kinesiology.msstate.edu/)
## Master of Science in Kinesiology
The Master of Science program offers four concentrations: Exercise Physiology, Sport Administration, Sport Pedagogy, and Disability Studies. The concentration in Exercise Physiology prepares students for careers in fitness and allied health care professions. The concentration in Sport Administration prepares students for careers in the sport industry, including positions with professional, collegiate, and recreational sport organizations. The concentration in Sport Pedagogy prepares students for leadership roles as coaches and physical educators. Initial license in Physical Education and Coaching is required for the Sports Pedagogy concentration. The concentration in Disability Studies prepares students for careers in physical activity promotion for persons with disabilities. These concentrations also prepare students for advanced study at the doctoral level.
### Admission Criteria
The following items are required in applying to the master’s programs in the Department of Kinesiology. The application portal can be found online at the Mississippi State University Graduate School website:
  1. A completed MSU Graduate School application form
  2. Official transcripts from all institutions attended since high school
  3. Three professional letters of recommendation. Ideally, the individuals writing the letters should be in a position to specifically comment about the applicant's academic ability--work ethic, and potential for success in graduate program. At least two letters should come from academic sources (professor, instructor, advisor, lecturer).
  4. A written statement of purpose, which should reflect a strong sense of career direction and highlight the applicant’s qualifications, skills, and professional experience. The statement of purpose be directly related to the applicant's research interests.
  5. A résumé or curriculum vitae


Admission is a competitive process. Positions within the programs are limited, and more individuals may apply than are able to be accepted. Competitive applicants will have a GPA of 3.00 or better in their final 60 undergraduate hours as well as a strong statement of purpose and positive letters of recommendation.
An international student applying for admission must score a minimum of 550 PBT (79 iBT) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or a minimum of 6.5 on the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) in addition to meeting all other admission criteria.
## Doctor of Philosophy in Kinesiology
The Doctor of Philosophy programs offers two concentrations: Exercise Science and Sport Studies. The degree is a research-focused program designed to prepare professionals with the cognitive and research skills needed to be productive scholars. The focus of the Exercise Science concentration is the scientific study of how biological systems function during physical activity, exercise and sports, emphasizing applications to both clinical and healthy populations. The Sport Studies concentrations involves studying sport from an interdisciplinary perspective, encompassing the fields of sport management, sport pedagogy, sport philosophy, and sport sociology, among others. 
### Admission Criteria
Prior to formally applying to the doctoral program, students should familiarize themselves with the research interests of graduate faculty members in the Department of Kinesiology and identify a faculty member whose research agenda aligns with their interests. A prospective applicant should then contact that faculty member to discuss their "fit" with the faculty member's research interests. If possible, prospective applicants are encouraged to visit the MSU campus. When an informal understanding is reached regarding the student's suitability to enter the doctoral program under the guidance of the faculty member, the student may then formally apply to the Graduate School. This does not guarantee a student admission to the doctoral program, but it is a necessary step prior to the formal application. 
The following items are required to formally apply to the doctoral degree programs in the Department of Kinesiology:
  1. A completed MSU Graduate School application form
  2. Official transcripts from all institutions attended since high school; students must have completed a master's degree prior to being admitted to the doctoral program
  3. Three professional letters of recommendation; at least two letters should be from university professors from whom the student has taken courses or worked with in a research capacity that can speak directly about their academic ability, research ability, and potential for success in a doctoral program.
  4. A written statement of purpose, which should clearly explain the applicant's research interests and highlight how these interests align with faculty members in the department, particularly the faculty member who the applicant wishes to serve as their advisor
  5. An academic writing sample (e.g., a published research article, thesis, or other academic paper)
  6. A curriculum vitae


An international student applying for admission must score a minimum of 550 PBT (79 iBT) on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or a minimum of 6.5 on the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS) in addition to meeting all other admission criteria.
### Application deadlines in the Department of Kinesiology are as follows:
Grad Application Deadlines Semester |  Date  
---|---  
Fall admission (domestic) | August 1  
Fall admission (international) | May 1  
Spring admission (domestic) | December 1  
Spring admission (international) | October 1  
Summer admission (domestic) | May 15  
Summer admission (international)  | March 1  
Applications are reviewed periodically each semester, and applicants should generally expect to receive a reply within 30 days of the application deadline. Because of the competitive nature of admissions, it is recommended that individuals apply as far in advance of a deadline as possible. Students who wait until the late application deadline to apply may find there are no remaining spaces available in the program.
## Academic Performance
Students in the Department of Kinesiology must meet University and College of Education academic performance requirements in order to remain in good standing. These requirements are found elsewhere in the Mississippi State University [Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/). Students are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with academic performance requirements.
## Master’s Degree Completion Requirements
The Master of Science in Kinesiology degree requires a minimum of 33 hours of graduate credit. The student will develop, in cooperation with the major professor and other committee members, a program of study during the first semester in the program.
The student pursuing Option 1 (Thesis) is required to complete 6 credit hours of thesis work as part of the 33 required hours. A thesis committee, consisting of at least three graduate faculty members, including the student’s major professor and at least one more graduate faculty member from the Department of Kinesiology, must be established. Upon completion of the thesis, the student must provide copies for the department head, major professor, and committee members.
A student pursuing Option 2 or 3 (Non-Thesis) must successfully complete written comprehensive examinations prior to graduation. The student must be within 6 hours of graduation (coursework completion) or in the last semester of study and in good standing to be eligible to apply for comprehensive examinations.
