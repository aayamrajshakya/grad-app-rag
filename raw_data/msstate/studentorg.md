Student organizations are a valuable part of the education of an engineering student. These organizations provide opportunities for students to enhance their education and prepare themselves for the engineering profession.
Belonging to a student organization allows students to get to know their peers and the faculty within their majors. They can also meet professionals who come to campus to make presentations. Spanning all engineering concentrations, these organizations help students develop teamwork skills and give them a better understanding of each discipline.
Networking opportunities available in these organizations allow students to establish life-long friendships and can aid in finding a job after graduation. Students can also gain insight into the courses they will have to take by talking to experienced peers.
Membership in engineering student organizations is strongly encouraged. A student should belong to the technical organization representing their major as well as a professional organization representing all engineering fields.
