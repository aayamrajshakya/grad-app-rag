# Celebrating 120 Years
Innovation meets tradition. For 120 years, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) at Mississippi State University has trained the agricultural leaders of tomorrow. While the agricultural landscape has changed exponentially in the last 12 decades, CALS remains at the forefront of innovation, technology transfer, and world-class applicable research that translates to better productivity and profits for our farmers.
As we train tomorrow’s leaders in precision and autonomous agriculture to feed, clothe, shelter, and fuel a growing global population, we stand upon the rich roots of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Mississippi State University. These roots have nurtured the fertile ground upon which today’s agricultural innovation, technology, and research are planted. See some of the major events that have occurred over the last 12 decades.
