## Laboratory Animal Resources and Care (LARAC)
The Laboratory Animal Resources and Care (LARAC) unit is based at the College of Veterinary Medicine but serves as a resource for both MSU AAALAC-accredited facilities: College of Veterinary Medicine and College of Arts and Sciences. The LARAC Facility Manager is responsible for the management oversight of the College of Veterinary Medicine research and teaching animal facilities, the personnel who provide animal husbandry and the fundamental program of animal care for animals used in biomedical research and teaching. Additionally, the Manager collaborates with the lab operations supervisor at the College of Arts and Sciences to ensure that the animal until in Harned Hall is maintained according to regulations. Reporting to the Facility Manager are two Team Leaders, each of whom have responsibility for managing full-time personnel and student workers and for providing animal care and husbandry. The animal care staff provides daily animal care and husbandry and minor facility maintenance. All members of LARAC have, or are pursuing, advanced certification through the [American Association for Laboratory Animal Science (AALAS)](https://www.aalas.org/).
