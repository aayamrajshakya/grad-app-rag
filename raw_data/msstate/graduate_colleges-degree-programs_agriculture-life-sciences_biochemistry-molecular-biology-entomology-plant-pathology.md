The department offers graduate study leading to the following degrees:
  * Master of Science in Agricultural Life Sciences with a concentration in Biochemistry, Entomology, or Plant Pathology
  * Master of Agriculture in Agriculture with a concentration in Entomology or Plant Pathology 
  * Doctor of Philosophy in Molecular Biology
  * Doctor of Philosophy in Life Sciences with a concentration in Biochemistry, Entomology, or Plant Pathology


The department also participates in interdisciplinary programs leading to the following degrees:

  * Master of Science in Agriculture with a concentration in Animal Nutrition
  * Doctor of Philosophy in Life Sciences with concentrations in Animal Physiology or Genetics
  * Doctor of Philosophy in Agricultural Sciences with a concentration in Animal Nutrition


## Admission Criteria
Prerequisites for admission include a bachelor’s or master’s degree in a physical or life science with a strong background in the program discipline of interest (biochemistry, molecular biology, entomology, or plant pathology). A graduate screening committee, composed of members of the Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, Entomology, and Plant Pathology faculty, screens all applicants. Final acceptance into a graduate program is contingent upon the availability of a suitable major professor. A minimum 2.75 overall grade point average on a 4.00 scale is required for admission. Test scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) are not
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
Maintenance of an overall GPA of 3.00 or greater is expected for students enrolled in M.S. or Ph.D. programs in the department. The student is allowed only two Cs. Any third C or the first grade below C (a D or F) is grounds for dismissal.
Approved "Programs of Study" are provided below. Students should develop programs of study with their major professor and graduate committee as Graduate Coordinator consent. If substitutions are made for required courses, these must be documented on the program of study form.

Such enrichment courses or technical proficiencies could include (but are not limited to) statistics, biocomputing, electron microscopy, plant transformation, tissue culture, production of monoclonal antibodies, etc. 
The Molecular Biology Ph.D. degree is primarily a research degree. However, a minimum of 30-40 hours of coursework and 30 hours of research beyond the B.S. degree are required. A student entering the program with a master’s degree will be required to take 30-40 hours past that degree. The courses shall come from the offerings of the department and from supporting programs. If the student desires a specific minor, 12 hours should be in that field. The selection of courses is left to the student in consultation with the major professor and graduate committee.
The student’s Ph.D. graduate committee will consist of a total of at least five members with at least three of these members from the department faculty. The student will submit a research proposal to the committee. No time limit is imposed, but it is suggested that the proposal be submitted within the first 1.5 years. The student will have yearly reviews with the graduate committee. The student is expected to produce publishable research.
The student must pass written and oral preliminary examinations dealing with his/her program of study. A student not passing the preliminary exams on a second attempt will be given the option of completing the research required for an M.S. (provided the coursework is also adequate). The student must pass a final oral defense of the dissertation upon completion of the research program.
