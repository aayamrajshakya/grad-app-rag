The Certificate of Public Design will be granted upon the successful completion of the above sequence of courses.
The purpose for the program is to prepare design professionals to work in community-oriented design organizations and to be leaders in the field of public design. The certificate curriculum is designed as a three-semester program. The participants must be graduates of an accredited professional degree program in architecture, planning, or landscape architecture. Up to six interns each year will be supported. Interns will work alongside the studio’s experienced full-time design staff on community projects for three-quarters of their time and complete coursework for one-quarter of their time.
