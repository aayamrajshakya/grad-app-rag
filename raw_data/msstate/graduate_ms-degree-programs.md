##  M.S. Degree Programs   

The Guidelines presented here are meant to be highlights. Full rules and regulations of the Graduate School can be found in the Graduate Catalog, which is available at [http://www.grad.msstate.edu](http://www.grad.msstate.edu/).
Graduate School rules, procedures and forms are complex, change continuously, and many events have deadlines. There are deadlines for:
  * Applying for graduation.
  * Thesis/dissertation defense or non-thesis comprehensive exam.
  * Dean’s signature on thesis/dissertation signature page.
  * Initial submission of thesis/dissertation to the Library.
  * Final (library-approved) thesis/dissertation to the Library.


Students should check the Graduate Academic Calendar on the Graduate School website. When in doubt about anything, a student should consult with the Physics and Astronomy Department Graduate Coordinator, Dr. Henk Arnoldus.

##  Master of Science in Physics (MS) Degree Programs Offered   

We offer the following options for the Master of Science in Physics (MS) Degree Program:
  * Thesis Option
  * Non-Thesis Option


##  Graduate School Degree Policy   

The Graduate School awards the degree (not the Physics Department)
The Graduate School will not award a degree if:
  * GPA lower than 3.00 on all graduate courses taken.
  * GPA lower than 3.00 on courses on the Graduate Program of Study.
  * D or F on Graduate Program of Study courses.
  * More than two C or lower grades on all graduate courses taken while in the program. This includes courses not on the Graduate Program of Study. A retake can be used to mitigate this condition.
  * More than one D or F on all graduate courses taken while in the program. This includes courses not on the Graduate Program of Study. A retake cannot be used to mitigate this condition.
  * A grade I (Incomplete) in any course.


A student falls under the rules of the Graduate Catalog that was in effect at the time of her/his admission to the program.
##  Overall Requirements   

At the time of entering the graduate program in Physics, all students are required to take placement examinations in classical mechanics, electromagnetic theory and quantum mechanics. The results of these examinations are used to determine whether the student has the appropriate background to take the 8000-level courses. If a student performs unsatisfactory on an exam, she/he will be required to take the corresponding 6000-level course(s).
Students are required to have a research advisor and begin research within one year after entering the program. Before that, the graduate coordinator is the academic advisor of the student. If a student wishes to have an advisor from outside the Physics Department, the student needs permission from the Graduate Coordinator.
Required Courses are listed in a separate document. If a student wishes to take a course outside the Physics Department, the student needs permission from her/his advisor.
Students who will have teaching assignments are required to attend and pass the Teaching Assistant Workshop. International students who will have teaching assignments are also required to attend the International Teaching Assistant Workshop (Fall admission only).
##  Credits and Performance   

Students must be enrolled in at least 9 and at most 13 graduate credit hours (courses numbered 6000 or higher) in Fall and Spring in order to hold an assistantship. This includes possible ESL classes.
Student must be continuously enrolled for at least one credit hour in the Fall and one in the following Spring or Summer until all degree requirements are met.
If the only thing left is graduation, then no enrollment required.
In order to maximize the number of Physics credit hours, the Department strongly encourages students to enroll in 13 credit hours per semester. Students should normally not take more than 9 credit hours of lecture courses per semester. The additional credit hours should be Research, PH 8000 (MS) or PH 9000 (PhD).
Continuing financial support is contingent upon the student maintaining at least a 3.00 GPA and making satisfactory progress towards the degree, and for students with teaching assignments, maintaining a satisfactory teaching performance.
Unsatisfactory performance may lead to probation or dismissal. The details of such procedures are given in the document ‘Physics Policy on Probation and Dismissal’.
If a student continues in a PhD program, after receiving the MS in Physics degree from MSU, courses taken while in the MS program may be used to fulfill requirements for the PhD program. However, courses with a grade of D or F may not be used, and no more than two courses with a C may be used. Used courses with a C will count towards the ‘C rule’ of the Graduate School: A student cannot have more than two courses with a C or lower grade while in the program. If a student receives a third C or lower grade while in the PhD program, the student must be put on probation, and repeat one of the three courses, and earn an A or B. If a student receives a fourth grade of C or lower, the student must be dismissed. This Physics rule is stricter than the Graduate School rule.
##  Course Retake Policy   

A student may retake a course if her/his ‘Request to Retake a Course’ is approved. Only one course can be repeated. A record of both courses taken will remain on the transcript, and both grades will be included in the computation of the GPA. No additional credit hours are generated from a repeated course. The higher grade will count for the above rules.
##  Comprehensive Research-based Examination   

Students must complete the CRE within 36 months of joining the departmental Ph.D/non-thesis M.S. program. You will have two attempts to pass. The CRE is overseen by the Ph.D. Advisory Committee or PAC. For more details, please check its [guidelines](https://www.physics.msstate.edu/sites/www.physics.msstate.edu/files/2025-02/Comprehensive-Research-based-Examination-final.pdf). If you have any questions concerning the examination, please email the PAC at: pac@physics.msstate.edu.
##  Theses and Dissertations   

Theses and dissertations must be approved by the Library before graduation. For details, see <http://lib.msstate.edu/thesis/>. The signature page must be approved by the Library before the defense. At least two weeks before the defense, a copy of the thesis or dissertation should be given to the members of the Graduate Committee. The thesis or dissertation should be sent to the Library after the defense, so that comments by the Graduate Committee can be included.
Students who pass the thesis/dissertation defense in a semester, but did not meet the deadlines for submission of the thesis/dissertation to the Library will the next semester need to enroll in GRD 9010 01 (zero credit and only $100 fee), and meet the Library deadlines for that semester.
##  MS - Thesis Option Guidelines   

The MS - Thesis Option program is designed to be a two-year program. Students should attempt to select a research advisor and begin research by the end of their first semester in the program. Typically, a thesis is completed in the fifth semester.
The Graduate Committee has at least three Physics graduate faculty with the major professor as chair. The student must defend her/his thesis. Students who wish to continue in the PhD program should apply for admission at least three months before the thesis defense.
### Required forms
  * Committee Request
  * Graduate Program of Study
  * Declaration of Examination/Defense
  * Report of Examination Results
  * Physics MS Thesis Defense Evaluation Form


In addition, two copies of the signature page must be signed.
##  MS - Non-Thesis Option Guidelines   

The MS - Non-Thesis Option program is designed to be a two-year program. The non-thesis option provides a means for PhD-track students to complete their PhD program in a timely manner. The Graduate Committee has at least three Physics graduate faculty with the major professor as chair.
