Although the deadline for graduate application are significantly later, all applicants who wish to be considered for assistantships in the Department (TA or RA) should complete their application and ensure ALL documents are received before:
  * January 1 (for Fall admission)


The Department recommends all new graduate students apply for Fall admission. The timeline associated with Fall admission allows for a more rigorous orientation for new students, which leads to a stronger start for most graduate students. Admission decisions are made on rolling-admission basis, where applications completed early have more opportunity for admission than those received later in the process. That being said, outstanding applicants may receive a rapid decision, where historically admission decisions on normal or average applicants can be over 6 weeks.

Degrees in Chemistry, Biophysics, Biochemistry, Material Science, and Biochemical or Chemical Engineering typically meet this requirement well. Degrees in Pharmacy are handled on a case-by-case basis. Advanced courses in multiple areas normally associated with chemistry degrees (Analytical, Biological, Inorganic, Organic, and Physical Chemistry) are required for admission.
  * A minimum undergraduate GPA of 3.2/4.0 over the last two years.
  * Have a bachelor's degree with the mode of instruction in English   

    * Or a minimum of 9.0 on TOEFL Essentials, 79 on TOEFL iBT, or 6.5 on the IELTS exam.
