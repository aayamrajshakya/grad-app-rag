# Current Issue: Volume 13, Number 2 (2025) -- Special Issue: Aging in America 
## Introduction
This special issue of the Journal of Human Sciences and Extension, Aging in America, aims to provide Extension professionals and human scientists with research, new or emerging initiatives, creative critical thinking, and innovative practices that will propel aging-related work within a next-generation Cooperative Extension System. Drs. James S. Bates and Erin L. Martinez served as co-editors of this special issue and curated 13 articles from 57 unique authors that highlight the current work of Extension, propose models for strengthening our impact, and serve as a call to action for enhancing the aging-related work of Extension. The outstanding contributions from the authors can be categorized into four thematic areas: innovations in intergenerational programming, proactive approaches to health and well-being, comprehensive end-of-life planning, and addressing disparities in aging services.
