## What is Open Source?
Open source refers to software, hardware, or other creative works where the source material is made freely available for others to use, modify, and distribute. It is a powerful model for collaborative innovation that accelerates research, enhances transparency, and creates impactful technology. At its core, open source is about community-driven development and shared ownership of technological advancements.
By participating in open source, our researchers and students join a global community, contributing to and benefiting from a vast ecosystem of knowledge and tools that push the boundaries of what's possible.
## The OSPO at Mississippi State University
Housed within the Office of Technology Management, the MSU Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is dedicated to supporting and guiding the university community in all aspects of open source. Our mission is to empower faculty, staff, and students to effectively use, create, and release open source projects while managing intellectual property, ensuring compliance, and maximizing the impact of their work.
We serve as a central hub for open source strategy, policy, and best practices, helping to align the university's open source activities with its broader goals of research excellence, economic development, and societal impact.
