The Student Research Travel award program is designed to support graduate and undergraduate students in the Bagley College of Engineering that have participated in research and are presenting that research at regional, national, and international conferences. Qualifying students will receive partial support to cover travel related expenses associated with the presentation of their research at conferences within their discipline.
## Eligibility Criteria
  1. The student applying for a travel award must be the author and presenter of the paper.
  2. The paper must be co-authored by a BCoE faculty member.
  3. The paper must have been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication and presentation before submitting an application. A copy of the accepted paper/abstract must be uploaded to the application site, and the paper/abstract cannot have been submitted and/or presented elsewhere.
  4. All current, full-time and part-time BCoE undergraduate and graduate students are eligible, though no student will receive more than 1 award a year

## FAQs
What is considered a national professional conference?  
National professional conferences are attended by professionals belonging to one or more engineering, science, and/or education fields. A conference that is regional in scope or attended by mostly students is not eligible.
What is considered a peer-reviewed conference paper/extended abstract?  
It is a full-length technical paper that has been evaluated by one or more anonymous reviewers assigned by the conference organizing committee and deemed acceptable for publication and presentation at the designated conference. The extent of peer-review may vary from one conference to another. A paper that is accepted for presentation upon submission and without any peer review is not eligible for this award.
Who is the principal faculty co-author?  
This is a faculty member who has contributed the most to the paper besides the student co-author.
If two or more students are listed as co-authors on two or more papers to be presented in the same conference or co-located conferences, can multiple students submit travel award applications to the same conference?  
If student A who is planning to present one paper is a co-author on another paper that also includes students B and C as co-authors, then only student A is allowed to apply for the conference travel award.
If the student applicant is a co-author on more than one paper at a given conference, would the Dean’s Office provide additional funding in support of this conference travel?  
No.
Can a student submit multiple travel award applications during an academic year?  
No.
Is it necessary for all the student co-authors to be from the same department or college?  
No. However, only BCoE students qualify for travel awards.
Is it necessary for the first student author to be the presenter?  
No, as long as the paper is presented by one of the student co-authors from BCoE.
Is a student co-author from outside the Bagley College of Engineering eligible for a travel award?  
No. Students must be enrolled in a BCoE program.
Can I submit an application for a student travel award if my conference paper is still under review?  
No. An application may be submitted only after a formal acceptance notice has been issued by the conference organizing committee.
Does submission of an application guarantee that funding will be received if I meet all other requirements? 
Can I submit an application to attend a conference even if I am not presenting? 
Can I submit an application to attend a student competition where I will be presenting?
