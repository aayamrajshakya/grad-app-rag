#  Life as an Art Student 
Studio learning is a unique experience, and the Mississippi State University Department of Art provides a supportive environment for personal growth and professional development. 
One big advantage of studio learning is it allows for more students to have more one-on-one time with professors; the Mississippi State University Bachelor of Art degree program boasts a low 15:1 student to faculty ratio.
Mississippi State art students have access to a variety of specialized facilities and tools to help them succeed in their studies, including computer labs, the Bob and Kathy Luke Library (college-specific material), a woodworking and metal shop, and the Universal Technology Lab (large-format printers and scanners, as well as other high-end software and periphery devices)
