# Urban Forestry
## Urban Forestry Concentration
This concentration provides the academic knowledge and real-world skills to address emerging needs for the management of trees in our towns and cities, and the urban/wildland interface. In a career as an urban and community forester, you will manage trees along city streets, in municipal parks, private woodlots, and utility right-of-ways. Employers include federal, state, and municipal governments, private consultants, and industry.

## Internships
**[Cooperative Education](https://www.career.msstate.edu/coop)** - Through its Cooperative Education program, Mississippi State University encourages students to receive practical on-the-job training along with their academic studies. Typically, students in this program accumulate one year of work experience in their chosen fields before graduation by alternating between studying at Mississippi State for a semester and working with a cooperating organization for a semester.
Students must complete two semesters of study and earn a minimum 2.5 grade-point average before entering the cooperative education program, and they must maintain a minimum 2.5 GPA. Generally, students begin work during the summer following their freshman year and work alternate semesters thereafter.
