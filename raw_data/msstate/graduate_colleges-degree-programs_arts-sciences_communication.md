The Master of Arts degree in Communication is a 33 credit hour program designed to meet the educational and preparatory needs for communication professionals looking to advance their careers, individuals preparing to become professional educators of speech, media and communication, and individuals planning to pursue a Ph.D. in Communication or related field of study. The program will provide students with a strong theoretical foundation in classic and contemporary communication theories; training in contemporary communication methods and their applications across contexts; allow students to explore and teach media history and best practices within and with contemporary media, mass media, social media, and digital media in different communication contexts and; equip students grounded examples, applied experiences, and research opportunities and insights to make them ready contributors to their organizations and communities. 
## Admission Criteria
To be considered for regular admission to the Master of Arts degree program in Communication, applicants must meet the following requirements:
  * Statement of Purpose that demonstrates how the program will assist applicants with career goals
  * 3 letters of recommendation--at least one academic reference preferred
  * 79 TOEFL or 6.5 IELTS minimum score for international applicants
  * 3.00 overall undergraduate GPA
  * Resumes are preferred, but optional


## Provisional Admission
The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 or higher GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C unless one course retake is approved per the Graduate Course Retake Policy). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's Program of Study. Courses with an S grade or transfer credits cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in provisional status, a student may be limited in the type of funding that can be used for a graduate assistantship (eg, positions that are state funded)
## Academic Performance
A graduate student should be placed on probation by the department when academic deficiencies occur but the student can potentially meet all degree requirements successfully. Examples of these situations include but are not limited to the following:
  * GPA falls below 3.00 required by the University;
  * Receives a third course grade lower than a B (one of these courses must be retaken and the student must earn a grade of B or higher); or
  * Fails to meet a departmental requirement.


A student may also be placed on academic probation if they fall short of any other standards for satisfactory academic performance established by their academic unit. Specific information relative to retaking of courses or completing remedial work will be established by the appropriate academic advisor, graduate committee, and Graduate Coordinator and shall be documented in written form. This remediation plan must specify a required date of completion. If the student intends to pursue the academic appeal process relating to the reason for being placed on probation, he or she must do so during the first probationary semester. If, at the end of the probationary period, the student has not met the requirements outlined in the remediation plan, she or he shall be dismissed. A student cannot take a comprehensive examination or defend/submit a thesis or dissertation during the probationary period without prior approval from the Academic Dean.
A graduate student shall
  * A student receives a second course grade of D or lower;
  * A student receives a fourth course grade of C or lower;
  * A student is found to be responsible for violating the Student Honor Code for a second time;
  * A student was placed on academic probation and failed to meet the requirements for release from probationary status;

  * A student falls short of any standards established by his or her academic unit, and the department recommends dismissal with approval of the Department Head (if applicable) and the Academic Dean.


A student shall be dismissed by the Graduate School for failure to meet University requirements as stated above after the academic unit confirms that there are no extenuating circumstances. A student can also be dismissed if the student's academic department recommends dismissal by submitting a Recommendation for Academic Dismissal form (a letter may be attached) from the Graduate Coordinator, approved by the Department Head (if applicable) and the Academic Dean, clearly stating the departmental requirements the student failed to meet.
