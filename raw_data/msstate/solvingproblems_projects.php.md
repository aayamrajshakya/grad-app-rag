#### Abstract
While overhead irrigation is the second most-prevalent delivery system in the state, most research and Extension efforts in Mississippi have focused on furrow irrigation. This project leverages data collected from Mississippi irrigators to direct research and Extension efforts and conducts small-plot and on-farm experiments to validate data trends and investigate new technologies and strategies. From these efforts, the most up-to-date information will be shared with the state's corn growers through traditional and innovative Extension outreach methods.
