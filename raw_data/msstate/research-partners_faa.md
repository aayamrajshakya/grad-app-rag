#  FAA & JAMS
Through RFRL, MSU is a proud member of two FAA Centers of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS): (1) The Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE) – a MSU-led coalition of 23 world-renowned research Universities and over 100+ government and industry partners – and (2) the Joint Advanced Materials & Structures (JAMS) Center of Excellence in which ACI is a new member.

MSU and JAMS are actively supporting the FAA’s demanding and expansive research needs in a collaborative effort to safely integrate UAS into the U.S. National Airspace System (NAS). JAMS research has already provided pivotal knowledge and results on such topics as UAS Collision Severity, Detect-and-Avoid (DAA) requirements for Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) UAS operations, UAS Certification Standards and Considerations, and even UAS Noise Measurement studies.
