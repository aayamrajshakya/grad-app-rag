##  Program Details
Ever wish for an easier, more affordable way to gather your course materials at the start of the semester? MSU’s Bulldog Bundle gives undergraduate students access to all required textbooks, lab manuals, access codes and electronic book versions in a convenient bundle before the first day of class—in most cases, at discounted prices. 
Through a partnership with Barnes & Noble, Bulldog Bundle allows undergraduate students to receive required course materials for all classes for a flat fee, regardless of how much each individual textbook or digital access would cost to rent or purchase separately.
Instead of purchasing materials a la carte, the cost is applied to the student’s account at the same time tuition is charged. The MSU bookstore provides each student with a convenient package for physical books, and digital materials are automatically populated to students’ courses in Canvas.
Reduce the cost of traditional textbooks by up to 50% with Bulldog Bundle!
