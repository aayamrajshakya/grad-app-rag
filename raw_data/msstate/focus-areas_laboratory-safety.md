Lab Safety Reviews 
EH&S performs routine Lab Safety Reviews to ensure suitable facility design, communicate critical safety guidance, and help maintain regulatory compliance.
[Our Procedures](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/focus-areas/chemical-hygiene/lab-safety/lab-safety-reviews)
##    
Standard Operating Procedures 
A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of written instructions that outlines the steps for performing a process safely. Learn more about laboratory SOPs below.

Lab Signage and Hazard Communication 
Lab signage is an important part of maintaining a safe working environment. Our signs provide information to lab staff, EH&S personnel, and first responders among others. If you need a new Lab Door Sign, Emergency Plan, or other hazard communication signage, please use the links below to contact EH&S.

Lab Closeouts 
Vacated research spaces must be appropriately decommissioned to assure a safe environment for future occupants. In addition to proper lab and equipment decontamination, lab decommissioning necessitates completion of an EH&S Lab Closeout Review.
