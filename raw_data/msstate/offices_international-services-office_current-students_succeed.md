#  How to Succeed
The following offices and resources are available to you to help you have a successful experience at MSU.
## Writing Center
The Mississippi State University Writing Center dedicates itself to helping all MSU students develop as writers and critical thinkers. Thus, the mission of Mississippi State's Writing Center is simple: our goal is to support the writing that is happening on campus. We do that by being available online and in person to writers who want to think about, talk about, and work on their writing and the ideas that they want that writing to communicate.

## Maroon Volunteer Center
In 2012, the [Maroon Volunteer Center](https://www.mvc.msstate.edu/) and Volunteer Starkville signed a memorandum of understanding creating an official partnership in volunteer efforts around MSU and the Starkville community.
In addition to one-time community service opportunities, they provide volunteers with information on a variety of on-going service programs that give them a chance to really roll up their sleeves and invest in making a difference.
