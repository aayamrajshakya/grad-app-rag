Master of Science in Nursing Program
Director: Dr. Kayla L. Carr
The Master of Science in Nursing program offers an educational pathway to practice as a Registered Nurse for those who have earned at least a bachelor’s degree in a non-nursing field of study. The education sequence consists of 58-semester credit hours offered over an accelerated, three term format. The competency-based program is face-to-face and consists of lecture, laboratory, and clinical practicum courses. Graduates of the program meet entry-to-practice competencies for the role of Registered Nurse and upon graduation are eligible for the NCLEX-RN licensure examination.
The program was granted Phase II approval in February 2024. Active recruitment began immediately after. MSU-SON intends to seat its inaugural class in the 2024-2025 academic year. MSU-SON submitted application for initial national accreditation through the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) in November 2023. MSU-SON will seek Phase III: Full State Accreditation by IHL while concurrently pursuing national accreditation by CCNE in November 2024.
