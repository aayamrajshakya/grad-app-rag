## What is the Academic Integrity Program?
The Academic Integrity Program is a two-part program that is designed to provide students with the proper education and resources to promote integrity in writing, ethics, research, and real world implications. Completion of the AIP is required for a student to have the “X” removed from an “XF” outcome. A student may only have the “X” removed from an “XF” outcome if the student has not previously completed the AIP for a previous violation.
