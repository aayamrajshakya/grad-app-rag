The Minor in International Studies is designed to enhance students' understanding of the global environment in which they are living.
Students completing this program will develop some proficiency in a foreign language, have experience living in another country, and have some general background of different cultures and societies. The Introduction to International Relations course serves as a broad introduction to the political, military, economic, and cultural interaction of state and non-state actors at the global level. The Principles of Macroeconomics course provides students with the background needed to build a deeper understanding of common issues of trade and development encountered in International Studies. The two upper division courses serve as capstones to bring the ideas of students in the program together from the perspective of their selected approaches-formalized as Tracks-to the minor. A total of 21 approved hours must be completed in this minor.
