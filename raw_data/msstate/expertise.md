Taking Care of What Matters
## Data Modeling, Predictive Analytics, and Machine Learning
We collaborate closely with clients and partners, tailoring our data modeling, predictive analytics, and machine learning solutions to specific needs.
Data modeling creates visual representations of real-world data and its relationships. That helps state agencies, nonprofits, and businesses understand complex data structures and recognize patterns. Predictive analytics and machine learning allow us to predict trends and build predictive models that help organizations enhance their operations and increase efficiency.
## Social and Economic Impact Research and ROI Studies
NSPARC evaluates the effects of social and economic programs, policies, or interventions on various stakeholders in Mississippi. We aim to measure the positive and negative consequences of programs and initiatives on such outcomes as employment, income, education, health, and social well-being.
We also conduct return return-on-investment (ROI) studies to evaluate the effectiveness of investments and initiatives across agencies and programs in Mississippi. ROI studies allow entities to make informed decisions about resource allocation, prioritize investments in effective programs, identify areas for improvement, and ensure effective use of taxpayer funds.
