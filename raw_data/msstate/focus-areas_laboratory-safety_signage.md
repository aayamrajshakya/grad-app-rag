#  Lab Signage and Hazard Communication
Lab signage is an important part of maintaining a safe working environment. These signs provide information to lab staff, EH&S personnel, and first responders among others. If you need a new Lab Door Sign, Emergency Plan, or other hazard communication signage, please use the links below to contact EH&S.
## Lab Door Signs
Lab door signs are used to relay information to EH&S personnel, first responders, and any lab visitors about the chemical and physical hazards within the lab space. Lab sign information should be accurate and current—please notify EH&S if you need revisions to your lab door sign or complete the online form below (New Lab Sign Form). Your newly updated lab emergency plan can be attached to the lab sign form as well. Once we receive your online form, we will create an updated sign and post it on your lab door.

## Emergency Plans
Emergency plans detail emergency equipment locations inside and outside the lab space; these plans also provide contact information and safe evacuation procedures in the event of an emergency. Please keep an updated emergency plan on the back of your lab door.

## Equipment Labels, Signs, Tags, and other Hazard Communication Decals
EH&S can provide appropriate labels, signs, tags, and decals for laboratory equipment; this includes fridge/freezer/microwave/etc., labels, eyewash/safety shower signs and inspection tags, storage cabinet labels, and various other hazard communication decals.
## Printable Labels and Decals
Appropriate labeling is imperative to maintaining an organized and safe working environment. Here you will find printable labels and decals that can be used to label secondary chemical bottles, label chemical storage cabinets and areas within the lab, and communicate hazards with lab staff and visitors.
### Secondary Container
These Labels are for chemicals stored in small bottles with no manufacturer label. They are designed to be printed and filled out by lab staff and will include chemical name, date prepared, preparer’s initials, PI last name, concentration, special hazards, or requirement.

## Storage Area and Hazard Placards
All storage cabinets should have an appropriate storage label.  
  
  
  
These labels are designed to be printed and posted on cabinets or areas where chemicals are being stored.
