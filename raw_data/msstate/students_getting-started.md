## Documentation Information
Disability-related documentation should provide information on the functional impact of the disability so that effective accommodations can be identified. Criteria for the source, scope and content of documentation differs by disability type.
Documentation may include assessments, reports, and/or letters from qualified evaluators, professionals, or institutions. Common sources of documentation are health care providers, psychologists, diagnosticians, and/or information from a previous school (e.g., accommodation agreements/letters, 504, or IEP documents). Note that the DRC reserves the right to request additional documentation when inadequate information is submitted. The professional making the diagnosis of a disability should be an appropriately trained evaluator/professional, such as a physician, psychologist, therapist, or educational diagnostician. For example, an audiologist would diagnose a hearing impairment; a psychiatrist, psychologist, or clinical social worker would diagnose a mental health disability. Documentation from a family member is generally not acceptable.
## Suggested Documentation 
  1. Typed on letterhead, dated, and signed by a qualified professional
  2. Diagnostic Statement with any related diagnostic methodology (diagnostic criteria and/or procedures)
  3. Symptoms experienced by the individual.
  4. Functional limitations to life activities. (Limitations inform which accommodations are appropriate.)
  5. Severity and frequency of the symptoms
  6. Expected progression of the symptoms or condition.
  7. Current medication(s) and any related side-effects.


### Submitting Documentation
The student or the professional proving the documentation can submit supporting documentation to the DRC. Documentation may be submitted in the following ways:
Strongly Recommended
  * Upload documentation in the student’s DRC application


If there is difficulty submitting the documentation, the following options are available:
  * Email - drc@msstate.edu
  * Delivery by student to DRC office (ground floor of Montgomery Hall)


Fax is the least preferred method, but if it must be used, contact the office to ensure the fax was received:

If you have a diagnosis of Autism, visit this link for information concerning MSU's Autism Liaison program: <https://www.addc.msstate.edu/liaison>. This is a beneficial resource, but it is not required to obtain accommodations from the DRC.
