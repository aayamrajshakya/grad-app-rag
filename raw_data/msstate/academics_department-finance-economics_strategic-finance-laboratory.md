# Strategic Finance Laboratory
Thanks to our loyal alumni and friends, MSU business students have the opportunity to learn about financial markets and real-world investment tools in the Strategic Finance Laboratory at McCool Hall.
This advanced learning environment designed to integrate investment education, financial research, and professional practice. This state-of-the-art facility functions as both classroom and a laboratory that brings a piece of Wall Street to Mississippi State University.
The Strategic Finance Laboratory is designed to provide students with a competitive edge as they obtain jobs in the investments industry or sit for professional certification exams. This multi-disciplinary facility also plays a role in student recruiting, industry relations, and the interactions between alumni and students. It is also the site of our semi-annual offering of the [Bloomberg Aptitude Test](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/expertise/universities/).
Offering 21 student terminals and the ability for interactive professor/student learning in a simulated trading floor environment, the Strategic Finance Laboratory is complete with a 24-foot stock ticker and ten 51-inch televisions which provide live coverage of the financial markets and world news. More importantly, this room is the only location in Mississippi where students have access to the [Bloomberg Terminal](https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/solution/bloomberg-terminal/), [Wharton Research Data Services](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/), and [Trading Technologies](https://www.tradingtechnologies.com/) professional software.
