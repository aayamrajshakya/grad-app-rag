STARKVILLE, Miss.—Mississippi State University has signed an Educational Partnership Agreement with Keesler Air Force Base, paving the way for a Bachelor of Applied Science in Weather and Environment––an MSU Department of Geosciences program that will provide Keesler Air Force members a streamlined pathway to complete a four-year degree.

Approved by the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning in May, the proposed BAS degree program will enable airmen to transfer technical training in weather-related fields directly for college credit, accelerating their progress toward a bachelor’s degree. The program is designed to build on the military’s rigorous meteorological instruction by integrating applied science coursework and real-world environmental applications.
“This partnership reflects MSU’s longstanding commitment to supporting our nation’s military and enhancing educational access for service members,” said John Rodgers, geosciences professor and department head. “By aligning the strengths of Keesler’s training programs with MSU’s academic resources, we are creating a meaningful opportunity for airmen to advance both their military and civilian careers.”
Located in Biloxi, Keesler Air Force Base is home to the 81st Training Wing and serves as a key site for technical training in the U.S. Air Force, particularly in the meteorology, communications and electronics fields. The base is recognized nationally for its advanced instruction in weather forecasting and environmental monitoring—skills that directly align with the proposed BAS degree’s objectives.
The agreement between MSU and Keesler strengthens both institutions’ shared goal of fostering innovation and professional development through accessible, high-quality education.
