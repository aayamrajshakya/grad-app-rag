# MSU Cheese
Another longstanding tradition, Mississippi State cheeses are manufactured and sold as a part of university teaching and research programs. In addition to the famous three-pound Edam cheese ball, the MAFES Sales Store on Stone Boulevard sells cheddar, jalapeno and Vallagret varieties, along with juices, jams and meats that also are produced on campus.
