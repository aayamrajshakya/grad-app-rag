##  Medical Requirements
All part- and full-time international students studying at MSU must complete four medical requirements. They are:
### Chest X-rays
Students must provide proof of tuberculosis screening with a chest X-ray. The X-ray must be performed and read by a U.S.-licensed physician, and it must be performed in the United States not more than six weeks prior to the first day of class. The MSU Longest Student Health Center will verify documentation. The ELI will make appointments for students needing X-rays.
### IGRA Test
Students must provide proof of tuberculosis screening with the Interferon Gamma Release Assays (IGRA) test. The IGRA test must be performed by a U.S.-licensed physician to confirm negative indications for tuberculosis, and it must be performed in the United States not more than six weeks prior to the first day of class. The MSU Longest Student Health Center will verify documentation. The ELI will make appointments for students needing the IGRA test.
### MMR Vaccinations
Students will receive their first MMR vaccination on campus, along with their chest X-rays and IGRA test, unless they can provide proof they have been vaccinated before arriving on campus. Students who have had the vaccinations need to bring the completed [immunization form](https://www.healthcenter.msstate.edu/immunizations) as proof.
[Click here](http://www.immunize.org/vis/vis_english.asp) for more information about the MMR vaccination.
### Health Insurance
All non-degree F-1 international students enrolled in the ELI are required to purchase the MSU Student Association Sponsored Student Insurance Plan which is made available through the Longest Student Health Center. Exchange Visitors with alternate health insurance will need to present proof of insurance to the ELI. Government sponsored students with insurance must show proof of coverage each session in order to be exempt from this requirement. The preferred providers for this plan are John C. Longest Health Center, Oktibbeha County Hospital, and United Healthcare Choice Plus.
Permanent Residents are classified as Resident Aliens and are not considered to be an international student.
Students are not required to purchase the MSU health insurance for their dependents, but it is highly recommended.
