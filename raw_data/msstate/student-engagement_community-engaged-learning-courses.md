# Community-Engaged Learning Courses
The [Center for Community-Engaged Learning (CCEL)](https://www.ccel.msstate.edu/) serves as a resource for faculty who are teaching or developing community-based education courses. CCEL’s goal is to further faculty practice in community-engaged learning and community-engaged research and scholarship. Community-engaged learning (CEL) courses are designated through a submission process run by CCEL. Courses must show evidence of engagement, reciprocity, reflection, and dissemination to receive a “C’ designation and course comment in the master schedule. Students can search the master schedule by the subject area “SL – Service Learning” to see which courses in any given semester are designated as CEL.
