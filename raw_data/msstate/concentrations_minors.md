#  Communication Minors
The Department of Communication, Media & Theatre offers minors in its five concentration areas – [Broadcast & Digital Journalism](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/minors#bdj-minor), [Communication & Media Studies](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/minors#cmst-minor), [Print & Digital Journalism](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/minors#pdj-minor), [Public Relations](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/minors#pr-minor), and [Theatre](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/minors#thea-minor). Students may choose more than one concentration minor. The required hours and specific course requirements vary for each concentration minor.
## CO Minor Intent Form
Students majoring in a different department interested in pursuing a communication minor in one or more of its five concentration areas should complete a communication minor intent form. Students must declare their intent to complete the requirements for a minor before their declaration to graduate. Once you complete this form and verify your email address, the completed form will be automatically sent to the department’s advisor. Please note: MSU does not currently have a process for adding a minor in Banner or Degree Works. The information on this form is for college and departmental tracking of minors.
[Minor Intention Form](https://msstate.na2.adobesign.com/public/esignWidget?wid=CBFCIBAA3AAABLblqZhCfIQK1FHFNmyMsi598TCYZaqpsnuIr2Rw9bWJpTEbXR7SA_I3AgOARfHlCNtsVVds*)
Students majoring in Communication may choose additional areas other than their concentration(s) in the department as unofficial minors. Since completing a communication minor as a communication student is done so in an unofficial capacity, a minor intention form does not need to be completed.
## General Information
  * A minimum grade of “C” is required in all courses in the minor(s).
  * All necessary prerequisites must be completed prior to enrolling in the course and cannot be taken concurrently. Prerequisites are listed in the [MSU Undergraduate Catalog](https://catalog.msstate.edu/undergraduate/).
