## Visual Identity Standards
**I. OFFICIAL ACADEMIC UNIVERSITY LOGO**
The official academic university logo consists of two elements: the wordmark, which is the words Mississippi StateUniversity
The logo is a mark designed to be used as ONE UNIT, and shall be identified with a TM until the Federal Trademark Registration is finalized, at which time the identifier will be changed to a ®. The official university logo should be used with all communications produced by the university. The following guidelines apply:
  1. The logo should be applied to the front outside cover of printed materials in most instances.
  2. When the logo is not applied to the front outside cover, it should be applied to introductory pages and/or the outside back cover of printed materials.
  3. For official web pages, the logo must appear at the top of the page on the left.
  4. The logo never should be used as a headline.
  5. The logo and wordmark always should be reproduced from official university artwork.


Mississippi State University is federally registered and shall be identified with a ® when used separately and apart from the logo.
The vertical and horizontal versions of the university logo also include the ™ identifier, where as the wordmark by itself utilizes the federally registered symbol, ®.
The university logo and wordmark in maroon, black and white are available for [download here](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/index.php).
A. CLEAR SPACE
This diagram indicates the staging specifications for the logo. The logo must be surrounded on all sides by the specified clear space to separate it distinctly from any other graphic elements. This clear space and separation from other elements provide graphic impact and preserve the integrity of the mark. Clear space is equal to the height of the letters of the word "UNIVERSITY" from the logo. The clear space varies with the size of the mark. Leave at least 1/8 inch of protected white space around the logo.
B. SIZING AND PROPORTIONS
Do not reproduce the official university logo or university unit logos less than 2 inches in width for the vertical version and 3 inches in width for the horizontal logo in printed material or as specified below for the web. At widths less than this, the clarity and integrity of the logo is compromised. 
It is expected that the full vertical or horizontal orientations be used. However, where space limitations occur, the Mississippi State University wordmark can be applied. It can be displayed no smaller than 1.5 inches wide.
When resizing the logo, it is critical that it be resized proportionately. Use the shift key when drag sizing (applies to both Windows and Macintosh platforms), or use equal percentages when using a scaling tool.
C. ACCEPTABLE PRIMARY UNIVERSITY LOGO/INSTITUTIONAL WORDMARKS
****Examples below show the maroon, black and white version of the university’s academic logo, both horizontal and vertical options, and institutional wordmarks.
**D. ALTERATIONS**   
Never alter or redraw the logo elements. Do not place the logo elements inside any other shape or combine them with any other symbol or graphic. The wordmark has been customized for the university; therefore, campus units should always reproduce the logo or symbol from authorized digital files or authorized reproduction-quality originals.
**E. UNACCEPTABLE USAGE**
Do not change the proportions or reconfigure the logo.
Rotating the logo is not allowed.
  
Resetting the type is not allowed, or using other M-State versions.  

**F. COLOR OPTIONS**
| A) The logo can appear in one color: Pantone 505, gray or black. For the web, it must be #5D1725 (maroon).  
---|---  
| B) The white version of the logo (both horizontal and vertical options) can also be used on dark backgrounds such as black or Pantone 505, this option allows for contrast and readability. Single-color publications often make use of this technique.  
| C) When possible, the maroon or black versions of the logo should also have the banner displayed in white, when printing in full color is an option. If the background color provides sufficient contrast and are printing in more than one color, keep the banner white.  
  
| D) A single-color logo can also appear on a light colored background or paper.  
| E) Other color combinations that provide sufficient contrast may be allowable in certain situations. Contact the Office of Public Affairs if you are considering other color combinations. In general, choose backgrounds that contrast with the logo to give it impact. Garish colors inhibit readability, as do busy or heavily textured backgrounds. Consult the approved MSU color palette. (See IV Color Palette).  
The white version of the M-State primary spirit mark, shown on the left below, can also be used on dark backgrounds such as black or Pantone 505. Filled white versions of this mark or ones where the banner is not white, as shown below on the right, are no longer used. 
**II. UNIVERSITY UNIT LOGOS**
A. University Units  
University units include colleges, departments, institutes, centers, labs and offices. The official university logo represents all Mississippi State University departments and offices; however, an individual unit may wish to identify itself by using the unit name through the use of a uiversity unit logo. With the unit name below “Mississippi State University,” the unit name receives prominence while retaining an overall university identity.
Unique college, department, school, office, and other unit graphics may not be used as the unit's primary logo on any university communications.
Units with existing logos may use them in a limited capacity; inside pages and back covers on print publications and within image slideshows and in the footers of websites.
Named colleges and schools with pre-existing logos may be granted minor and/or special exceptions only after consultation with the unit’s leadership, the Office of Public Affair’s chief communications officer and the vice president for development and alumni.
Examples of units using the approved typography and M-State for university unit logos (horizontal and vertical version):
Official university unit logos are available for  _[download here](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/secondaryunitlogos.php)_.
University unit logos may be used on mailers, inside pages or back covers of publications, internal memos, internal newsletters, promotional items and employee apparel/t-shirts. Under certain conditions they may be used in print ads. They should NOT be used on letterhead, envelopes, business cards, covers for external publications and external collateral material. Questions about the use of these university unit logos may be sent via email to identity@opa.msstate.edu.
**B. Using multiple logos**  
When displaying multiple logos on print publications and electronic communications the text for each unit may be stacked in alphabetical order (or order of importance of sponsorship or similar) underneath the vertical university logo. See example shown below.[request form here](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/designrequest).
Vertical Example:
Horizontal Example:
C. Stacking Unit Names with Marks
Academic units are not permitted to stack the Script State with their unit name. However, when space or clarity constraints make the full unit logo impractical, units may stack the primary spirit mark (M-State) with their unit name for merchandise or apparel graphics only. This ensures consistency with university branding while allowing flexibility for promotional formats.
  
Need a merchandise or apparel graphic? Please submit a design request so the OPA design team can provide a compliant setup for your unit.
**III. SUPPORT GRAPHICS**
A. Other Entities  
Programs and events that are organized through a university unit that already have a specific icon for that program or event, may continue to use their current icons so long as the primary academic university logo or the sponsoring unit’s logo is prominently displayed with the graphic also on applicable materials. (Example: fliers, programs, mailers) 
Graphics for programs, campus organizations, clubs and events cannotmust
Program and event graphics are not limited to using only spirit marks. Developed graphics not using the standard university unit logo look must be approved by Office of Public Affairs (OPA) prior to use. OPA reserves the right to disapprove graphics and marks created for groups and programs on the basis of non-standard design and/or designs that are confusing or detrimental to the overall brand. Designs can be submitted to OPA for review by filling out the [form here](https://form.jotform.com/231415555831151). 
If the organizers of a program or event wish to have a logo set-up similarly to a university unit logo in format, that is also permissible. To request a logo be typeset within the visual identity standards for university units, please fill out the[ form here](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/designrequest).   

**B. Student Organizations**
Student organizations have two categories, sponsored and registered. [Click here to learn more about Mississippi State University's Student Organizations.](https://www.studentactivities.msstate.edu/organizations/all-student-organizations)
Sponsored
Sponsored Example:
  
  

Registered
Registered Example:
Neither sponsored nor registered student organizations may use alternate graphics similar to MSU’s official spirit marks (alternate bulldogs, variations of paw prints, or other illustrations of cowbells) in their organization’s logo. 
Student organizations for which the university also has an NCAA team or is considered a club sport must include the text "Club" in their logo designs.
The use of spirit marks on promotional materials is allowed for all student organizations, provided they use licensed vendors. All merchandise that includes the name of the University and/or logos and spirit marks of the University must be ordered from licensed vendors – NO EXCEPTIONS. This requirement applies whether the merchandise is sold or given away. The [Office of General Counsel](http://www.legal.msstate.edu/index.php) should be contacted to confirm that the vendor is licensed.
Student organizations must abide by the guidelines found on [cowbellconnect.msstate.edu](https://msstate.campuslabs.com/engage/).
Student organizations that create a website are required to obtain their[ domain and webspace from ITS](https://www.its.msstate.edu/files/StudentOrgWebspaceRequestForm.pdf) and must use the university template.
**IV. COLOR PALETTE**
Along with the official MSU maroon being Pantone 505, below is a sample of approved primary and accent colors that can be used in promoting the academic side of the university in print and on the web. Accent colors may be used to highlight an area in a color that works with maroon. You cannot use the accent colors without using maroon. Maroon should always be the dominant color in university publications.
  
[](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/materials/msstatecolors.pdf)
Adobe swatch library files for the above colors are available for [download here](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/index.php#swatchdownloads).
Note:
**V. UNIVERSITY SEAL**
The university seal is the formal identifier of Mississippi State University. The seal was adopted by the institution in 1932 and has been modified several times since then. Elements in use since the 1890s include a sword, symbolizing the military character of the early institution, and a key, representing the "key to knowledge." The shield, symbolizing the federal role in a land-grant institution, has been part of the design since its inception. No alterations or overlapping graphics are permitted with the seal. The minimum diameter of the seal is 5/8". Use of the seal should be restricted to business cards and official university documents, such as diplomas, high-level certificates, awards, annual reports, and letterhead from the Office of the President. 
**VI. UNIVERSITY TAGLINE – TAKING CARE OF WHAT MATTERS**
Taking care of what matters is the university’s tagline and is a complete and distinct phrase. Do not tweak or alter it. Do not add to it, subtract from or play with its wording.
When the brand tagline is displayed as a stand-alone headline or with university logos, it should be written in all capitals, same color, with no additional emphasis formatting (i.e. no bold or italics on individual words within the phrase), no smaller than 10pts in size, and no period: TAKING CARE OF WHAT MATTERS
When possible, the brand tagline should be displayed using Futura-Medium ([or open source Jost - Medium](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost)). The use of the pre-created typeset tagline can be [downloaded here](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/materials/TakingCareofWhatMatters_TypesetPackage.zip). 
  

When the brand tagline is in copy - naturally as part of a sentence or end of a paragraph - it should never appear inside quotation marks and it should always be written in sentence case: At Mississippi State University, we are taking care of what matters.
VII. OTHER UNIVERSITY MARKS & GRAPHICS
A. Alumni Marks   
Marks used by alumni chapters can be [downloaded here](http://www.opa.msstate.edu/identity/alumnichapters.php). The marks directly below, FAMILY and ALUMNI, may be used by alumni groups, student groups and internal departments of the university. The bulldog silhouette that includes Hail State and star burst effect is a mark restricted to event use only in relationship to Giving Days. The bulldog-Hail State-star burst mark is not allowed for use outside of Alumni or Giving Days.  
  

B. Spirit Marks  
The athletic and spirit marks are used to communicate school spirit. Spirit marks may not be used in departmental secondary logos; however, the Athletics Department, officially recognized student groups and alumni organizations may use athletic and spirit marks in their logos with prior approval by the Office of Public Affairs. These marks should be used only when a bolder, more informal look is desired, and never should compete graphically or be used as a substitute for the university's official academic logo. The marks shown below in the subcategories 1-5 must not be altered, either in appearance or color. 
Spirit marks cannot take the place of the primary university logo on publications and websites promoting the academic side of the university.
Usage guidance for academic units:  
• The Script State may not be used in combination with academic and research unit names.  
• The primary spirit mark (M-State) may be stacked with unit names only on merchandise and apparel, when the full unit logo cannot be used due to space or clarity.
1. Primary Spirit Mark  

2. Secondary Spirit Mark
3. Spirit Word Marks  
The Mississippi State horizontal and vertical spirit word marks use the ™ next to the marks and are for promotions only. Academic units are encouraged to should utilize the [institutional word mark](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/identity/index-new.php#wordmark) and not the spirit wordmarks ones. The Hail State marks include the ® mark.  
  

4. Other Spirit Marks  
While the M-State logo is the most recognizable of MSU’s informal spirit marks, others strongly represent the institution. These are the paw print, outline of Mississippi and star, the bulldog silhouette, and the cowbell. These spirit marks must be used with a primary mark or text referencing Mississippi State University unless they appear on a product for retail.   
  

5. Baseball Marks  
The following marks used by Athletics and retail are for Baseball only. Their use is not allowed for internal institutional units.  

6. Bully & Belle Marks  
The Bully & Belle Marks may be used as is or customized with alternate clothing and props for Student Organizations and other Institutional Units outside of Athletics. Use of these marks is encouraged over the creation of alternate illustrations of the live mascot or the use of unapproved bulldog silhouettes. Any altered illustrated version of these upright, dressed bully marks must be reviewed and approved by the Office of Public Affairs prior to use.  

Customization Examples:
**C. Starkvegas Marks**  
Welcome to Fabulous Starkvegas graphics can be used by Athletics, alumni, student organizations and internal departments on promotional items or at retail. They cannot be used as standalone graphics without reference to the university on print materials.  

**D. Retail Marks**  
College Vault logos shown below are for retail use only. Their use is restricted.  

**E. Support Graphics**  
University graphics and marks that are widely recognizable across the campus community and have been granted approval from both the Office of General Counsel and the Office of Public Affairs. 
1. ARC M   
The mark is known as the ARC M, and is named and registered for the Mississippi Animal Research Center. It is currently recognized by the livestock community as a graphic that represents Mississippi State University’s quality of livestock. The Department of Animal and Dairy Science is allowed to use the mark on promotional items such as shirts, jackets, vests and caps for faculty and student representing the University at events. The mark would not replace or be used on official university letterhead or business cards, only for promotional items and apparel. The logo will run vertically only, there is not a horizontal option.

In the heart of Mississippi,  
Made by none but God's own hands,  
Stately in her nat'ral splendor  
Our Alma Mater proudly stands;  
Mississippi State we love you,  
Fondest mem'ries cling to thee,  
Life shall bear thy spirit ever,  
Loyal friends we'll always be.  
  
Chorus:  
Maroon and White! Maroon and White!  
Of thee with joy we sing;  
Thy colors bright our souls delight,  
With praise our voices ring.
Words by T. Paul Haney Jr. Music by Henry E. Wamsley
  

Hail State (Fight Song)  
Hail dear ol' State!  
Fight for that victory today.  
Hit that line and tote that ball,  
Cross the goal before you fall!  
And then we'll yell, yell, yell, yell!  
For dear ol' State we'll yell like H-E-L-L!  
Fight for Mis-sis-sip-pi State,  
Win that game today!
Words & music by Joseph Burleson Peavey, 1939

Mississippi State-Woooo!  
Damn right!
**IX. WEB USAGE**
By policy ([World Wide Web Pages and other Electronic Publications 01.13](https://www.policies.msstate.edu/policy/0113)), the official university logo must appear on every official web page of the university. 
Any of the following two logo versions may be used. They may be either maroon or white, but no other color. Transparency is permitted however, to show the logo on a background. They may not be used any smaller than:
  
| 300 pixels wide by 52 high  
---|---  
| 270 pixels wide by 120 high  
| 300 pixels wide by 52 high  
| 270 pixels wide by 120 high  
These sizes do not include the protected space surrounding the logo.
The official academic university logo must appear at the top left of the web page. No other Mississippi State graphics may be used in place of the university logo with the exception of an approved university unit’s logo, which can be  _[downloaded here](http://www.opa.msstate.edu/identity/secondaryunitlogos.php)_.
Nothing else may appear higher on the page than the official academic university logo or the university's unit logo (See II University Unit Logos).
The official academic university logo may be used, but is not required, on student and faculty personal web pages located at a msstate.edu address.
The official MSU maroon color for web pages is the web-safe color 93, 23, 37 (RGB) or #5D1725 (hex). The named color "maroon" should not be used; in other words, use <body bgcolor="#5D1725"> rather than <body bgcolor="maroon">.
The official university website template is located here: [https://www2.drupal.msstate.edu/examples](https://www2.drupal.msstate.edu/examples)
Use of this template, through the assistance of [ITS Web Services](https://servicedesk.msstate.edu/TDClient/45/Portal/Requests/ServiceCatalog?CategoryID=1020), will be the standard for all university websites. The header, menu and footer requirements must be met as displayed here. A few elements within the footer and header allow for customization; a unviersity unit logo in the header, top right menu bar link options, social media icon displays, a support graphic or secondary unit graphic to display in the footer - lower right - if needed, and unit address in the footer. Any further variations beyond the university approved template will require approval from the Chief Communication Officer.
MSU web sites should comply with these standards.
For questions about logo placement and web usage, contact identity@opa.msstate.edu at 662-325-7467.
**X. EMAIL SIGNATURE BLOCK**
Individuals who wish to include a logo in their email signature block may use the official academic university logo (horizontal or vertical) or one of the Spirit Marks (excluding the Paw Print). Phrases such as “Go Dawgs,” “Hail State,” “Taking care of what matters” or other MSU-related phrases may be used. Academic and research related confidentiality clauses that are necessary for electronic communications may be used. No other phrases or quotations should be included.

TAKING CARE OF WHAT MATTERS
**XI. LETTERHEAD**
University stationery sends a powerful visual message about the writer and the university. A consistent visual identity through the use of the official university logo projects a sense of institutional unity. The official university logo must be the main identifying element on university letterhead and must be printed in PMS 505 maroon or black ink. Only Athletics are exempt from these letterhead guidelines.
Certain units of the Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine may use adaptations of the basic Mississippi State letterhead that are necessary to comply with federal regulations on the use of penalty mail (Penalty mail - official federal government mail, other than franked mail, that is authorized by law to be transmitted in the mail without prepayment of postage.)
**XII. BUSINESS CARDS**
A. Employee Business Cards  
Business cards often introduce the university to people not familiar with the institution. It is important that this visual contact convey an identity that can be reinforced in subsequent contacts through consistent use. University business cards should be printed in PMS 505 maroon or black ink.
The primary side, which includes the contact information, should contain the university academic logo or the university seal along with the wordmark as shown in the below examples. Because of the size of a business card, other logos, individual unit logos and slogans should not be used on the primary side of the card in replacement or competition with the formal official academic university logo. This additional information may be added to the secondary side of the card. Template files for MSU business cards can be [downloaded here](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/assets/materials/msstate_businesscard_options.zip).

**B. Student Networking Cards**
Students must use the card shown below for networking cards. The official academic university logo may not be used. Students - including undergraduate, graduate, graduate assistants, graduate research assistants, or doctoral candidates - cannot use the official MSU employee cards. The cards must identify “student” status and include the expected graduation date. Cards must be printed by an approved vendor/licensee and approved by the Office of Public Affairs. [Click here](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/identity/images/studentnetworkcard_temp.zip) to download a template of the below example.
[](https://www.brand.msstate.edu/identity/images/studentnetworkcard_temp.zip)
**XIII. ENVELOPES AND MAILING LABELS**
University business envelopes in various sizes should be printed with the official University logo or approved secondary logo and return address in PMS 505 maroon or black on the front top left corner. Special event logos or themes also may be used, but must be printed on the back flap of the envelope. Specialty or announcement envelopes for invitations or custom cards can also have the return address printed on the back flap of the envelope in black or PMS 505 maroon.
**XIV. PUBLICATIONS**
A. University Logo Inclusion:   
The official university logo must appear prominently on the front or back cover of all university publications. The offices of Public Affairs and Agricultural Communications offer design and project coordination. Units of the university are encouraged to seek assistance with publication design and production through one of these departments. If these units choose to develop and produce their own materials, the design should be reviewed by Public Affairs or Agricultural Communications prior to printing to ensure consistency with these standards.
**B. University EEO Statement Inclusion:**  
All university departments and divisions are required to include the appropriate non-discrimination statement on all publications.
[[Click here]](https://www.civilrights.msstate.edu/non-discrimination/statements) to review the current statements.
**XV. VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION**
University vehicles will be identified by displaying the M-State on the sides and the Mississippi State University wordmark on the rear of the vehicle in a manner consistent with state regulations. The name of the university unit may be added below the M-State when appropriate on the side of the vehicles. Please obtain proper typesetting of the M-State and unit name from the Office of Public Affairs. The Mississippi State University wordmark across the back may be printed no smaller than 16” wide and the spirit wordmark on the side of the vehicle may not be printed any smaller than 20” wide. Vehicles vary in size and type—car vs truck vs SUV— thus the size and placement of the logos should highlight the marks to their best advantage. 
The logo will be displayed in maroon, white or black, depending on the vehicle color. Artwork for vehicle identification is available through the Office of Public Affairs.
Example: Unit name displayed on the sides.
