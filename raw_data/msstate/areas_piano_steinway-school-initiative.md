##  Steinway School Initiative 
Announcing the public phase of the All Steinway School Initiative!
Mississippi State University has entered the public phase of the All-Steinway School Campaign with a goal of $2,000,000.00 to fund the purchase of additional Steinway pianos for our students. All-Steinway School status will make Mississippi State University one of a handful of music departments in the world to earn such an acclaimed distinction. These magnificent instruments each take a year to build by a team of artisans and craftsmen and receive the Steinway emblem only when all is perfectly assembled. Steinway is the primary piano choice of artists throughout the world in all genres of music.
Gifts during the public phase can be made online by visiting [this link](https://securelb.imodules.com/s/811/foundation/interior-form.aspx?sid=811&gid=1&pgid=2318&cid=8458). Gifts of $1,000 will be recognized as “key donors” on an original Steinway piano. Gifts of $500 will be recognized as “contributing donors”. Gifts of $250 or more will be publicly recognized as participating in the All-Steinway School Initiative. Gifts of any size are welcome and appreciated.
Please join us in building a piano fleet that ranks with the world’s premier conservatories and music departments. Your generosity and commitment to Mississippi State's All-Steinway School campaign will ensure our students have access to instruments and experiences that will nurture their full artistic potential and prepare them for successful careers in music. With your help, Mississippi State University will achieve “All-Steinway School” status.

##  Steinway Model "A"  

At 6 feet 2 inches, this amazing piano sounds like a much larger model.

Its slightly longer keys give the player a sense of heightened sensitivity and control. The size of this piano is large enough to satisfy those who demand a full, rich bass — yet small enough to beautifully fit into almost any studio.
