#  Life as an Architecture Student 
The Mississippi State University School of Architecture provides a supportive environment for personal growth and professional development. Studio learning is a unique experience; our students have their own designated studio space in Giles Hall and have 24/7 access to that space. 
One big advantage of studio learning is it allows for more students to have more one-on-one time with professors; the Mississippi State University Bachelor of Architecture degree program boasts a low 15:1 student to faculty ratio.
Mississippi State architecture students have access to a variety of specialized facilities and tools within Giles Hall to help them succeed in their studies: digital fabrication lab, printing and plotting lab, the Bob and Kathy Luke Library (college-specific material), a woodworking shop, a 3-D printer, a CNC router, and more.

## Field Trips and Site Visits
A favorite week for many students is the annual field trip week, a requirement for all students in the Mississippi State University Bachelor of Architecture degree program and an important component of study for an architecture student. 
Students in all studio levels travel to different metropolitan locations each year to expose our students to art, design, and construction in these areas. The field trip location generally coincides with the studio focus for that year level, and students prepare for these trips by engaging in research and producing case studies. The time on site is divided between structured visits to important buildings, museums, and architectural offices, and free time for students to explore on their own.
Student participation in the field trip week is a required component of design studio, and the university assesses field trip fees in conjunction with tuition. 
Over the years, field trip destinations have included metropolitan destinations such as Atlanta, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Louisville, and Cincinnati.
The fifth-year field trip is a two-week study abroad in Europe. 
In addition to the weeklong field trips, students also participate in local and regional field trips. These trips are not only planned in conjunction with the design studios, but also complement lecture courses and may last a few hours or require an overnight stay.
Destinations for short-term field trips have included the Columbus Brick Factory, Viking Range Corporation, Auburn’s Rural Studio, construction sites, and Mississippi small towns.
