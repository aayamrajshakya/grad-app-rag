# Landscape Architecture
Department Head: Dr. Anne Spafford Graduate Coordinator: Dr. Peter Summerlin  
Landscape Architecture Building  
Box 9725  
Mississippi State, MS 39762  
Telephone: 662-325-3012  
E-mail: cl1004@msstate.edu
Graduate study leading to a Master of Landscape Architecture degree is offered in the Department of Landscape Architecture; thesis and non-thesis options are available. Students in the program have the opportunity to work with faculty on a wide range of research and design topics within the profession of landscape architecture. Special program emphasis is placed on watershed planning, landscape management, and community planning and design. The design studio courses broadly consider landscape issues related to water, health, and habitat in an effort to achieve the department’s mission of "fostering the will and ability to plan, design, build and manage regenerative communities.”
## Admission
The applicant to the M.L.A. program should have a minimum GPA of 2.80 on a 4.00 scale. A student without a bachelor’s degree in landscape architecture from an accredited program may undertake the M.L.A. as a first professional degree but is required to undertake additional “leveling” coursework to ensure competency in the field; this typically requires an additional year of study. Submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores is recommended but not required. The applicant’s submission should include a letter of interest that includes a written statement (no more than 1500 words) explaining his or her interest in pursuing graduate studies in landscape architecture at Mississippi State University. Three letters of recommendation from individuals familiar with the applicant’s academic work, motivation, and character should accompany the application. The applicant should also submit a detailed résumé. Applicants with degrees from allied fields (such as architecture or civil engineering) should submit a portfolio if they wish to be considered for course reductions during the leveling year. Contact the department’s graduate coordinator for additional information.
## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates (GPA of 3.0 or higher) in professional design programs are encouraged to apply to the Accelerated MLA Program. This program permits students to earn up to 16 hours of graduate level coursework during their junior and senior years of undergraduate studies. Students take graduate level courses and earn both undergraduate credit and graduate credit simultaneously. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a Program of Study for the graduate degree. Application to this program may be made at the end of the sophomore or the junior year (i.e., after completion of 60 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). Students interested in applying to the Accelerated Program should contact the Department of Landscape Architecture's Graduate Coordinator for more details.
