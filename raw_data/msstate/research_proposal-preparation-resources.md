### Policies and Procedures
  * **[Research Policies and Procedures](https://www.osp.msstate.edu/procedures):** Proper administration of sponsored project funds includes policies set forth by sponsors and policies, procedures, and guidance set forth by Mississippi State University.
  * **[Limited Submissions Notices](https://www.research.msstate.edu/initiatives/limited-submissions):** External funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Energy, etc., often limit the number of proposal submissions that a university may submit. This information is always provided in the agency announcement. To make sure that Mississippi State University provides an equal opportunity to all researchers pertaining to a limited submission, it is necessary that a process be in place to insure an equal opportunity. Therefore, all limited submissions are required to go through the Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) before being submitted to OSP.


##  MSU Grant Systems
