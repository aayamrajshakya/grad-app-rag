##  Minor in Music and Culture  

The Minor in Music and Culture is intended for students with an interest in non-Western music, especially the music of Africa and the African Diaspora. The program offers students from any major the opportunity to study the ways in which humans are represented through music. The minor features an interdisciplinary approach to exploring music and supports Mississippi State University's vision. The minor is distinct from other existing degrees in that it offers an anthropological approach that does not rely heavily on music performance skills.
