Colleagues, collaborators, spouses.
At Mississippi State University, few partnerships are as seamlessly intertwined as that of Michael and Danielle Nadorff, faculty members in the Department of Psychology.
“People always joke about what it must be like to live with another psychologist, but honestly it’s helpful to have someone with a similar training background to bounce things off of,” said Professor Michael Nadorff. “None of us knows all the answers, and we work better as a team when we can take advantage of each other’s expertise.”
Associate Professor Danielle Nadorff, who serves as the undergraduate coordinator for her department, agrees. “While we are always careful to maintain confidentiality, it’s a huge asset to have a built-in sounding board at home. Our research areas overlap thematically, which leads to some really productive conversations.”
Michael’s work focuses on sleep issues and suicide prevention, while Danielle studies the impact of grandparent-led caregiving on mental health, including sleep and suicidality in youth raised by relatives. Their shared interest in stress, resilience and mental health creates natural intersections.
“If I’m analyzing data or trying to understand a complex dynamic, he can offer a valuable perspective, and vice versa,” Danielle said. “It’s an advantage to be married to someone who understands the pressures of academia and can help you see a problem from a new angle.”
“There’s no need to explain why a grant deadline is stressful or why I have to drop everything for a clinical emergency,” added Michael. “Danielle understands because she lives it too.”
While they work side-by-side in the same department, they maintain their independence and professionalism. “We constantly get emails meant for the ‘other Dr. Nadorff,’” Danielle said, laughing. “We’ve gotten very good at forwarding them with a quick ‘I think this one’s for you.’”
They also make space for their relationship beyond the office. “We carve out rituals—like watching TV competition shows together—to make sure we connect as a couple outside of work,” Danielle said. “It’s not just about being colleagues or collaborators. It’s about being partners in every sense of the word.”
That support extends to career choices. Danielle has delayed applying for promotion to full professor to focus on family, while Michael credits her flexibility as enabling his own professional momentum, including securing more than $15 million in grant funding for MSU.
Coming to MSU straight from doctoral studies at West Virginia University, the couple found rare dual placements in the same department. “What started as a practical decision turned into a deeply rewarding career for both of us,” Danielle said. “We’ve stayed and built our home in Starkville because of the unique combination of opportunities here.”
As researchers, both are drawn to the land-grant mission and MSU’s access to rural and underserved populations. “A lot of my grants are service-focused, where we do a lot of training and support in the state,” Michael explained. “MSU gives me the flexibility to be on the front lines.”
Michael recently was honored with the 2024 Friend of APTC Award from the Association of Psychology Training Clinics. He also received the Kinlock Gill Award from the Mississippi Psychological Association in 2023 and was named MSU’s Mid-Career Research Scholar in 2022.
Danielle, named Clinical Psychology Graduate Mentor of the Year in 2020, finds her greatest fulfillment in mentoring students. “Helping them develop their passion and watching them succeed is one of my favorite parts of the job.”
For Michael, the work is intensely personal. “I get the privilege of not just researching suicide but also responding as a clinician. It’s challenging, but it’s also an honor to be trusted in someone’s most vulnerable moment.”
“A dual-career academic life is a team sport,” Danielle said. “The paths won’t always be linear or in sync. But no one else will understand the pressures and victories like your partner. Celebrate the wins and be there for the setbacks—that’s what partnership is all about.”
