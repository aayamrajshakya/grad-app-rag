---|---  
Instructional Support Fee per credit hour | $25.00  
Tuition and fees listed are subject to change and do not include all possible charges. Additional fees may apply. Please refer to the master class schedule for individual course charges. 
Who should pursue this degree?  
P-12 educators and other professional staff who wish to advance their career through the pursuit of a doctorate degree and have earned an Educational Specialist (Ed.S.) or equivalent in P-12 or related fields. Students holding a master's degree may be admitted, but will be required to complete 30 credit hours of electives approved by their advisor.
This Ed.D. degree focuses on applied research, which is more appropriate and applicable to graduates who want to engage in application of their skills and knowledge, rather than pursue a career that focuses on a traditional theoretical research agenda as a faculty member in post-secondary education settings.
What are potential careers?  
This doctoral degree offers opportunities for students to enhance qualifications for leadership and other key positions, to increase knowledge base appropriate to a doctorate, and to enhance the graduates’ trajectory in their selected career in educational and related settings, particularly within the school and district P-12 levels, universities, and government agencies.
Students will develop the skills necessary to support learning in various educational settings and work effectively in non-profit organizations, government agencies, private companies, and academia.
## Program Structure
This 61-hour program (31 hours beyond the Ed.S. degree or equivalent) builds on a specialist degree (or equivalent) and will require a capstone or applied research project as the culminating of the degree rather than a traditional dissertation.
