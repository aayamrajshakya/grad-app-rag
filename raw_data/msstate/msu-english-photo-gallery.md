##  Ways to Get Involved in MSU English   

##  The Writing Center 
Each semester, the Writing Center employs several undergraduate students to work as consultants on an hourly basis, and we hire students from a variety of academic disciplines and majors.
In order to be eligible for hire, students must maintain at least a 3.0 GPA and complete EN 3243: Writing Center Tutoring Training taught each Spring semester. Prerequisites for the course are successful completion of Composition II with a minimum grade of a B (or equivalent credit).
Undergraduate consultants typically work between 10 and 12 hours per week, with additional opportunities for contributing to our Center’s activities and for professional development available throughout the semester.
Interested individuals can contact Loreeda Rios (L.Rios@msstate.edu) for more information.

##  Sigma Tau Delta 
All English majors with 12 credit hours in the major and a B average are invited to join MSU’s chapter of Sigma Tau Delta. The group regularly judges Buzzy’s Creative Writing contest for Starkville School District students, and has organized various fundraising and service activities, such as selling Valentine’s Day poetry cards. All members are eligible to travel to the Sigma Tau Delta annual conference, and to publish their creative and critical writing in the society’s journals.
About Sigma Tau Delta:
Sigma Tau Delta is the International English Honor Society. A member of the [Association of College Honor Societies](http://www.achsnatl.org/), it was founded in 1924 at Dakota Wesleyan University.
Sigma Tau Delta's central purpose is to confer distinction upon students of the English language and literature in undergraduate, graduate, and professional studies. Sigma Tau Delta also recognizes the accomplishments of professional writers who have contributed to the fields of language and literature.

##  Humanities Camp 
Humanities Camp is held in the summer (usually June) and provides 24 nominated high school scholars from across the state the opportunity to explore the Humanities with other like-minded MS scholars through expert lecture and class discussion along with hands-on activities and field trips, thus providing avenues for future potential study and/or careers and fun along the way.
While the camp itself is reserved for high school students, there are plenty of ways you can get involved as both an undergraduate and a graduate student.
