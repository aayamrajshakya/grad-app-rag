Perhaps you've seen CSI: Crime Scene Investigation
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/forensic-science-technicians.htm): Forensic science technicians aid criminal investigations by collecting and analyzing evidence. Many technicians specialize in various types of laboratory analysis. Forensic science technicians typically need at least a bachelor’s degree in a natural science, such as chemistry or biology, or in forensic science. On-the-job training is generally required for both those who investigate crime scenes and those who work in labs. The median annual wage for forensic science technicians was $60,590 in May 2020. Employment of forensic science technicians is projected to grow 14 percent from 2019 to 2029, much faster than the average for all occupations.
