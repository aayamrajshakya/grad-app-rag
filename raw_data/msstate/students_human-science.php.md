## Background Check
Procedure for getting a Child Abuse Registry Check and Fingerprint Cards completed.
  1. Call Beyonka at the Child Development and Family Studies Center ([662-325-3031](tel:6623253031)) and set up a time to go by and pick up the required paperwork (Note: you will need your original social security card, no copies or photos, and driver's license—this is all for the Child Abuse Central Registry Check). You will fill out paperwork then Beyonka, Andrelyn, or Samantha will sign as a witness.
  2. Take fingerprint cards to the MSU police department (25 Walker Road) and have fingerprints rolled, if you notify them that you are a MSU student then there is no charge for fingerprinting but previously it cost $5.00.
  3. You will pay the fingerprinting processing fee at the Child Development and Family Studies Center using a debit or credit card; the total processing fee is $54.17 and this fee is payable before your fingerprint cards will be mailed.
  4. Bring all paperwork, fingerprint cards, and documents back to Beyonka for review; the Child Development and Family Center mails documents and keeps copies until official documents are processed and you have a cleared letter of suitability stating that you can work with children.


Beyonka will then be able to track it through the fingerprinting department's website with the center's login information. Once the fingerprint card(s) have cleared the system and the student has a letter then the Center will notify the student and give them a copy via their official university email. The center will send a copy of the letter of suitability to the Student Services Coordinator, and they will add to the student’s official record.
If the student's information is not fully processed then the Mississippi State Department of Health's fingerprinting division located at Jackson, MS will contact the applicant via a letter with the reason and instructions on how to clear up any offenses on their record. The center will only be notified that the person cannot be around children, we are never told what the record shows.
The other reason why someone would not be able to be fully processed is if their fingerprints did not roll well, in which case the Mississippi State Department of Health's fingerprinting division located at Jackson, MS, will contact the center that they need to submit additional fingerprint cards for the applicant. There is no additional fees if this is necessary.

## Certificate Programs
### Gerontology
A minor in Gerontology is available at the undergraduate level. For graduate students, a Certificate in Gerontology is offered. Gerontology is the study of aging and late life potential from the perspective of many disciplines. Students learn strategies for enhancing the quality of life and life expectancy. No matter what your area of study, a Gerontology minor or Certificate may make you more marketable to a future employer. Increased life expectancy means more opportunities for careers with older Americans. It is projected that the number of Americans over the age of 65 will double by 2030. This population increase is expected to result in greater demand for services and professionals trained to meet the special needs of the older adult. If you want to capitalize on some of the opportunities this presents for your future career, consider the [Gerontology minor/Certification](https://www.gerontology.msstate.edu/). 
### Trauma-informed Child Advocacy Certificate Program
