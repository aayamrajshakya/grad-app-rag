## Inviting a Family Member
Family members of a student may apply for a B-2 visa to visit the student or attend a graduation ceremony in the United States. [Click here for more information.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html)
##### How to Apply
There are several steps to apply for a visa. The order of these steps and how you complete them may vary by U.S. Embassy or Consulate. Please consult the instructions on the [U.S. Embassy or Consulate website](http://www.usembassy.gov/).
Gather and prepare the following required documents before your visa interview:
  * Passport valid for travel to the United States – Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your period of stay in the United States (unless exempt by country-specific agreements). Each individual who needs a visa must submit a separate application, including any family members listed in your passport.
  * Nonimmigrant Visa Application, [Form DS-160](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html#ds160) confirmation page.
  * Application fee payment receipt, if you are required to pay before your interview.
  * Photo – You will upload your photo while completing the online Form DS-160. If the [photo upload fails](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos/frequently-asked-questions.html), you must bring one printed photo in the format explained in the [Photograph Requirements](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/photos.html).


Note: Visa applicants must qualify on the basis of the applicant's residence and ties abroad, rather than assurances from U.S. family and friends. A letter of invitation or Affidavit of Support is not needed to apply for a visitor visa but if you would like to include an invitation letter, template letter here

F-2 dependents may study part-time at a college or university but may attend K-12 schools full-time. If an F-2 would like to study full-time, he/she will need to change status to F-1. Information about that can be found here (link to Change of Status page under Newly Admitted students)
J-2 dependents may study full-time with no restrictions.
