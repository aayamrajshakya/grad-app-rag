# NMR Facility
The Mississippi State University NMR Center houses Bruker AVANCE III 300 MHz, Bruker AVANCE III HD 500 MHz, Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz, a Bruker Neo 800 MHz NMR, and a Bruker EMX-10 EPR Spectrometer. This core magnetic research facility supports the department's faculty and student research efforts. As the most advanced NMR facility in the region, our service center is also committed to supporting on-campus, statewide, and regional researchers
NMR is used to study the structure of and interactions between molecules, and it can be applied to chemical kinetics and molecular motions as well. It has the added advantage of being a non-destructive technique, and it allows for quantitation of molecules in the solution state.
### Collaboration and Inquiries
If you would like to discuss how our facility can support your magnetic resonance needs, please contact [Dr. Nick Fitzkee](https://www.chemistry.msstate.edu/directory/ncf43 "Dr. Nick Fitzkee Contact Info"), the facility director. A variety of services are available, including remote access, mail-in support, self-service use, and NMR consulting. We can also provide custom pulse-program development services. [Dr. Shrikant Sharma](https://www.chemistry.msstate.edu/directory/ss4850 "Dr. Shrikant Sharma Contact Info"), our facility manager, handles the day-to-day operations of the facility. Dr. Fitzkee and Dr. Sharma share over 25 years of combined NMR expertise spanning biomolecular, organic, inorganic, and organometallic systems.
_We anticipate adding solid-state NMR capability to our facility in fall of 2025!_

### Scheduling and Policies
Users interested in receiving training on the NMR instruments should contact [Dr. Shrikant Sharma](https://www.chemistry.msstate.edu/directory/ss4850 "Dr. Shrikant Sharma Contact Info"). Dr. Sharma will assist you with setting up an account and learning to use the instrumentation. Regular training seminars and NMR classes are also available through the Department of Chemistry. All users are required to adhere to the NMR Facility Policies (see link in side bar). Users who violate the policies risk losing their access to the facility.
Instrument scheduling is done using the [Faces Scheduling System](https://faces.ccrc.uga.edu/). Secure, remote file access is handled with MSU's [FileSender Service](https://filesender.msstate.edu/).
### Helium Recovery
As Mississippi's most advanced NMR facility, we are also the first facility to recover the helium from NMR boil-off. Our helium recovery system was supported by the NSF under grant number [2304919](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2304919&HistoricalAwards=false) and commissioned in 2024. For more information on this resource, check out Dr. Fitzkee's [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@FitzkeeLab). Dr. Fitzkee has also contributed to articles on helium recovery in the popular press, which you can read [here ](https://theconversation.com/helium-is-an-essential-material-for-research-and-medical-equipment-but-its-nonrenewable-and-difficult-to-recycle-218668)and [here](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250331-why-helium-shortages-are-worrying-the-world).
