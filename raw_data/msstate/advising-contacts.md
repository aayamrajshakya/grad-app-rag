# Advising Contacts
If you are interested in declaring a major or changing your major, you likely have questions. One of the best first steps is to get in contact with the department to get information about the major and program. Use the contacts below to learn more about the program in which you are interested. 
The process to change your major has recently changed. Speak with your advisor to walk through this process. In your myState account, scroll to see eForms on the left-hand list. Under Student eForms, you will see Change of Major and complete the form. If you have routing questions, speak with your current advisor.
