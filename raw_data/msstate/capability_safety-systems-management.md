#  CAPABILITIES 
## Safety Systems/Management
When ASSURE was established, the team was built around a strong group of universities that had significant experience in safety management through their aerospace, operations, maintenance, and air traffic control education and training programs as well as our FAA test ranges. Much of the work ASSURE has done in this area has focused on providing frameworks and adjustments for unmanned aircraft systems’ differences and operations.
