# Lean
* * *
What is a Lean Enterprise? Taiichi Ohno, the founder of the Toyota Production System, defined it this way: “All we are doing is looking at the time line from the moment the customer gives us an order to the point when we collect the cash. And we are reducing that time by removing the non-value-added wastes” (Ohno 1988). This is a simple and efficient explanation of a complex system and culture.
A lean enterprise applies TPS principles to all aspects of its business.
