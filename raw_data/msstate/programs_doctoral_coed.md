# Ph.D. Degree in Counselor Education and Supervision
## Overview
The doctoral program in counseling at Mississippi State University builds upon the knowledge, skills, and work experiences students have acquired in counseling or counseling related fields and prepares them to become highly competent practitioners, faculty researchers and scholars, administrators, leaders in the profession, and excellent teachers and clinical supervisors. The program's design and training philosophy is based on the scientist-practitioner model and emphasizes critical thinking skills, the integration of theory with practice, experiential learning, scholarly research, advocacy and social justice awareness and activities, and professional identity and leadership roles.
The program is a focused, developmental sequence of advanced coursework which include a counseling core, a minor or focus area, elective courses, practicum and internship, extensive research and statistics, passing written and oral doctoral comprehensive exams, and successfully planning and defending the dissertation. Counseling core coursework includes advanced studies emphasizing theory, clinical supervision, multicultural competencies, assessment and appraisal, teaching, advocacy, social justice, and leadership, ethics, consultation, research skills development, and critical thinking. Doctoral students also complete a minor or focus area from any academic department in the university offering graduate coursework with a prefix different from the COE program emphasis. This gives doctoral students the opportunity to benefit from a broad array of theory, practice, and research in fields related to counseling. Doctoral students must also complete 900 hours of practicum and internship experiences in a setting appropriate to their program concentration area.

## Course Sequencing and Student Progress
Each doctoral student enrolled in the program is assigned a faculty advisor who assists the student with course selection and navigating through to successful defense of the doctoral dissertation. Each student is strongly encouraged to communicate frequently with his/her advisor. Coursework provides a balance between theory, practice, and experiential learning. The course sequence varies depending on the students' enrollment status (full or part-time) and enrollment in summer classes. The program can be pursued on a full-time or part-time basis. Most full time doctoral students complete the program in three years, including summers. Academic and professional development evaluations are made of all doctoral students each semester to ensure ongoing professional growth and completion of coursework in a timely manner. There are other important requirements for the doctoral degrees in counseling at Mississippi State University. It is the student's responsibility to know them and to make sure his/her program of study conforms appropriately to these requirements. When in doubt, the student is urged to consult with his/her faculty advisor at all times.

## Professional Development
Many opportunities are available for professional development throughout the doctoral students' program. Doctoral students are expected to participate in professional and community leadership experiences and advocacy and social justice activities that benefit their clients and the profession. In addition, they are expected to become members of their appropriate professional organizations and to seek out opportunities to serve on state, regional, and national committees of ACA and its affiliates or those of their appropriate specialty areas.
Doctoral students are required to deliver one or more presentations at regional, national, or international conferences and serve as the primary presenters.
