# Global Engineering Leadership Minor
With today’s integrated global economy, engineers must understand other cultures, other ways of doing business, and be a part of collaborations that span the globe. To advance in their careers, modern engineers must have not only a strong engineering background, but also cross-cultural experience and management skills.
The minor in Global Engineering Leadership is designed to enhance students’ knowledge of engineering practice in the global marketplace. Students completing this program will develop proficiency in a foreign language, have experience living and studying in a foreign country, and be familiar with engineering leadership and management techniques.
