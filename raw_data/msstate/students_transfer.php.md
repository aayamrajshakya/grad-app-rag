# Transfer Guide to MSU & CALS
Interested in joining the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences? We would love to have you join our family. Find out below how to transition seamlessly to Mississippi State and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.

Transfer students are important at MSU. Over 40% of our current students are transfers - so we know how to help you make the transition as seamless as possible.
Mississippi State has worked with all of the community and junior colleges in Mississippi to develop a [transfer course equivalency table](https://mybanner.msstate.edu/prod/wwskttlg.P_SelSBGI). Reviewing this table will let you know which courses at your community or junior college match courses offered at MSU, and help keep you on track for a seamless transition.
If you are transferring from a community college outside Mississippi or from another four-year institution, you need not worry. Feel free to contact one of our Transfer Admissions Counselors at admit@msstate.edu for assistance.
To plan for a seamless transition between community college and completing your major at Mississippi State, we suggest the following steps: 
  1. Decide what you are going to [major](https://www.cals.msstate.edu/students/index.php) in when you come to MSU.  
  

  2. Find the curriculum online for the major you choose.  
  

  3. With the curriculum in hand, select classes at your community college each semester. Visit the MSU Registrar's [transfer course equivalency table](https://mybanner.msstate.edu/prod/wwskttlg.P_SelSBGI) to find out which classes from your community college will transfer.  
  

  4. Most importantly keep close contact with the registrar's office, your community college advisor, and a departmental contact within your major at MSU.
