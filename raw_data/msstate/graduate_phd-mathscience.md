#  The Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences Program
The Ph.D. in Mathematical Sciences program is an interdisciplinary program designed to ensure that students acquire knowledge across a broad spectrum of the mathematical sciences and develop expertise in a chosen field of concentration, understand how it relates to other areas, and are able to apply this knowledge to solve real-world problems. Students in the Ph.D. program are provided with opportunities to gain consulting experience through the Center for Statistical and Mathematical Services in the department, as well as opportunities to participate in research projects through other facilities on campus, such as the Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation. As a result, the Ph.D. program prepares students to work in industry, government, or academia.

## Note
The student should earn at least 53 semester hoursRequired courses for the Ph.D. programCore Courses<https://www.math.msstate.edu/graduate/masters-mathematics> or <https://www.math.msstate.edu/graduate/masters-statistics>.

## Breadth Requirements for the Ph.D.
In keeping with the emphasis of the doctoral program that each student acquires breadth in the mathematical sciences, each student in the program will demonstrate a satisfactory grasp of each of the areas listed below.
  1. A Programming Language;
  2. Matrices/Linear Algebra;
  3. Probability/Statistics;
  4. Advanced Calculus;
  5. Computational Mathematics/Statistics.


The GCC members will determine a student's satisfactory grasp of the areas listed above.

## Doctoral Committee
Each student in the Ph.D. program is assigned an academic advisor
  * Students are encouraged to choose their major professors early in their programs of study; nonetheless, students must choose their major professors no later than the end of the second year of their program.
  * The student and the major professor then select the other members of the Doctoral Committee, consisting of the major professor and four graduate faculty members
  * The Doctoral Committee so formed needs the GCC's approval.


The student and the Doctoral Committee select the courses for the student's program of study with the GCC's approval. The Doctoral Committee also monitors the student's progress.

## Examination Procedures
### Qualifying Examinations
In order to ensure that the skills and basic knowledge have been acquired to carry out the research necessary for the dissertation, the student must demonstrate competence in three different areas
Ph.D. with a Mathematics Concentration:
The student chooses three coursesat least one from A-C and at least one from D-G
  * A. Real Analysis: 
  * B. Functional Analysis: 
  * C. Complex Analysis: 
  * D. Applied Mathematics: 
  * E. Ordinary Differential Equations: 
  * F. Partial Differential Equations: 
  * G. Computational Mathematics: 


Ph.D. with a Statistics Concentration:
The student chooses two sequencesone from A-B and one from C-D
  * A. Statistical Inference
  * B. Applied Probability
  * C. Linear Models
  * D. Design of Experiments


For a Statistics Concentration, the third area
Qualifying Examinations Schedule:
  * Written qualifying examinations are normally scheduled twice a year, once in SeptemberFebruary
  * To demonstrate satisfactory progress in his/her graduate studies, a student is normally expected to complete his/her qualifying examinations by the beginning of the third academic year of Ph.D. work.
  * A student is allowed to repeat an examination only once.


### The Dissertation Committee
After the qualifying examinations have been passed, the student's Doctoral Committee will be reconstituted to form the Dissertation Committee
  * The Dissertation Committee will consist of at least five graduate faculty members, including a major professor and at least three additional graduate faculty members from the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.
  * The committee's primary responsibility will be to supervise the student's research and writing of a dissertation in the area of specialization, and its members should be chosen with this mission in mind.
  * The student's major professor will enlist a person from outside the Department of Mathematics and Statistics who has expertise in the dissertation area to serve as an external examiner.
  * This person will read the dissertation and submit written comments regarding its quality and significance to the student's committee.
  * The external reviewer's letter will be sent to the Graduate Coordinator for their record.


### Preliminary Examination
When the qualifying examinations have been passed, the breadth requirements have been met, and all course work on the program of study has been completed, the student may request the preliminary examination
Admission to Candidacy: 
### Final Examination
Once all other examinations and the dissertation have been completed, the student's committee will schedule the student's final examination
Note:
  * To set the final examination, from work completed during the Ph.D. studies, students are expected to prepare at least one manuscript suitable for submission to peer-reviewed journals. This ready-to-submit manuscript shall be acceptable to the major professor. 
  * By the GCC's recommendation and Head's approval, a Ph.D. candidate will be rewarded for each accepted paper in a qualified refereed journal related to the Ph.D. dissertation's research area prior to his/her graduation.
