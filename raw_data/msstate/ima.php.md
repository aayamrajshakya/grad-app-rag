### Institute for Mathematics and its Applications
The [Institute for Mathematics and its Applications](http://www.ima.umn.edu/) (IMA) was founded by the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/) [Division of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=DMS) and the [University of Minnesota](http://www.umn.edu/)to carry out a crucial interdisciplinary mission.
