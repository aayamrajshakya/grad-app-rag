# Research by Faculty
The faculty of the Michael W. Hall School of Mechanical Engineering is very active in research and graduate education, with degrees offered at both the master's and doctoral levels. In keeping with the broad technical mission of mechanical engineering education, the school has both the faculty expertise and the facilities to conduct a wide variety of design, analysis, and testing functions. The primary research strengths of the faculty are in the areas of heat transfer, fluid mechanics, mechanical systems, mechanics, materials, and manufacturing.
  * The current research projects in the [heat transfer/fluid mechanics](https://www.me.msstate.edu/research/heat-transfer-fluid-mechanics/ "Heat Transfer/ Fluid Mechanics") area include:  
Computational Fluid Dynamics, Solidification Modeling, Combustion Engines, Energy Conservation, Thermal and Fluid Systems Modeling, Advanced HVAC Technology, and Uncertainty Analysis.
  * The current research projects in the [mechanical systems/materials](https://www.me.msstate.edu/research/mechanical-systems-materials/ "Mechanical Systems/ Materials") area include:  
Finite Element Analysis, Powder Metals, Smart Materials, Fatigue, Computational Materials Engineering, Friction Stir Welding, and Composite Materials.
