# Systems
## Artificial Intelligence
Systems is the hardware and software that provide computing capability for digital devices. Systems research at MSU includes investigating the use of alternate hardware architectures to improve computational speed, secure networking, and model-driven software architectures to support high performance, realtime, and secure systems, and analysis of digital media for forensic purposes.
