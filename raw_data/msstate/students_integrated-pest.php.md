# Integrated Pest Management
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an interdisciplinary concentration of study in Entomology, Plant Pathology and Weed Science. Effective management of pest problems requires a broad base of knowledge in the pest disciplines and practical field experience. The Integrated Pest Management concentration features a strong core of courses in the three pest disciplines (entomology, plant pathology and weed science); a strong background in biological and physical sciences; and practical training through an internship. The curriculum is designed to meet the needs of students who wish to enter a career immediately upon graduation or pursue advanced degrees. A range of electives allow students to personalize their degree program for careers in crop production, agri-business, natural resource management, and/or graduate studies preparation. Graduates are well prepared for employment with industry; state and federal research; extension and regulatory agencies; private agricultural consulting firms; farmer's cooperatives; nurseries, home and garden centers; greenhouse plant production; and corporate farms. The Integrated Pest Management curriculum is in the Agronomy major.
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/agricultural-and-food-scientists.htm): Integrated pest management is equivalent to an agricultural scientists. The median annual wage for agricultural scientists was $68,830 in May 2020. Overall employment of agricultural scientists is projected to grow 9 percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Employment of agricultural scientists is projected to grow as research into agricultural production methods and techniques continues. 
## Curriculum
Mississippi State University is now offering degree programs that may be completed in three years. These undergraduate degree programs are special programs which allow highly motivated and hard-working students the opportunity to complete a degree in three years rather than the traditional four years. Both the three year and traditional four year degree program are available in Agricultural and Environmental Soil Sciences.

## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates at Mississippi State University are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program. This program permits enrollment in graduate courses in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science during the student’s final year of undergraduate studies. Enrollment of up to 9 hours of graduate courses is approved for students admitted to the Accelerated Program. Upon completion of the graduate course(s), undergraduate credit is also awarded for the course. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the M.S. degree. Application to this program may be made as early as the end of the junior year (i.e., after completion of 90 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). This option is only available for students pursuing a thesis-based Master of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science.

## Precision Agriculture Certificate Program
There is a need to train students in the broad array of precision agriculture technologies. This certificate program complements majors taught across College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) departments. This certificate features emerging technologies in decision-based agricultural planning and implementation.
