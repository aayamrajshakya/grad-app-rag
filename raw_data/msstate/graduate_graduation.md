# Graduation
Degree candidates must apply
A student who applies for graduation in a certain semester but does not graduate must apply again in a subsequent semester. The applicant will pay a fee for the new application, as degree applications and application fees shall not be applied to future semesters.
## "Walking Early" for Graduation
Students who participate in commencement exercises must have completed all
  * Health-related hardship associated with their scheduled graduation
  * Military relocation for the graduate or spouse
  * International VISA travel restriction for the graduate or immediate family members


Students who meet the above criteria must seek written approval from their Department Head and Academic Dean. If the department and college approve, the request should be sent (with signatures) to the Director of Graduate Programs in the Graduate School for final approval.
