#  Laser Safety
Image
Lasers have many uses and applications in research and development. MSU has a vast and continually growing inventory of laser equipment.
In order to follow applicable regulations and mitigate the unique hazards presented by lasers, EH&S offers laser safety training to all MSU laser users. Please reach out to [radiationsafety@ehs.msstate.edu](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/focus-areas/radiationsafety@ehs.msstate.edu) to enroll in training.
Laser safety training is required for all users of Class 3B and Class 4 lasers. If you are unsure if your laser meets the criteria, please contact us for more information. It’s a good idea to complete the training even if your laser does not meet the threshold for requiring it.
