#  Image of Research
A picture can say more than a thousand words … and sometimes more than an entire dissertation. 
The Image of Research competition gives students the opportunity to engage creatively with their research, share behind-the-scenes views of their research processes, or portray their academic study in visual form. 
2026 Image of Research Final submissions will be displayed at the Union Art Gallery on the second floor of the Union between March 16 and March 27, 2026.
We hope you can join us for the Gallery Reception on March 17, 2026 from 2:00 PM to 3:30 PM for light refreshments and to learn more about the finalists' images
Registration will open on January 14
