# Frequently Asked Questions
* * *
##### Who is my advisor?
  * The CFR Faculty Advisor list is posted on the bulletin board in the Student Lounge.


##### I have a question about my OASIS curriculum sheet? Where do I go?
  * Contact the Office of Student Services in Room 130 Thompson Hall or 325-2624 for an appointment to discuss your question.


##### Why did a fellow student receive credit for a class that I did not?
  * Each student's record is like a different map. Crossroads are based on the institution the course was taken at, pre-requisites, order of courses taken, major requirements, grade earned, when a student started college, etc... Visit the Office of Student Services for an appointment to review your OASIS curriculum sheet or call 325-2624.


##### Will a "D" grade transfer?
  * No, CFR does not accept transfer grades of "D".


##### When should I have a graduation audit?
  * Students should initiate a graduation audit with the CFR Office of Student Services two semesters prior to the expected graduation semester. For example, if a student intends to graduate in the spring, he or she should complete his or her audit before the preceding fall semester. An appointment with the Coordinator of the CFR Office of Students Services is required. The student's faculty advisor is sent a copy of the audit results when the student and the Coordinator have finalized the audit.
Students are not certified for graduation until the audit has been completed. Finalizing a graduation audit ensures the student acknowledges that all degree requirements are met. The student must also apply for graduation before the deadline listed in the Academic Calendar of the MSU Bulletin. After this deadline, the Registrar's Office will notify applicants via their MSU student emails to have all their MSU accounts paid in full by a second deadline date. The graduation application fee should be paid by this deadline. Students should not miss this deadline, as they will be removed from the graduation list. Students removed from the graduation list will be required to reapply for graduation and pay another graduation fee.


##### What is the last date to drop or add a course?

##### Can I get a waiver for a prerequisite requirement?
  * It is possible, but not likely. Pre-requisites are pre-requisites for a reason, the CFR is committed to the success of its students. Pre-requisites are the foundation required to successfully complete the next course. Students interested in pursuing a waiver can find the form in the Student Lounge, 131 Thompson Hall.


##### I want to take a course at the local community college at home this summer. Can I do this?
  * Yes, with permission. Transfer Request forms are available in the Student Lounge, 131 Thompson Hall. Complete the form and make an appointment with the Office of Student Services.

If approved, you will add the class to your schedule. Note the Office of Student Services is not adding the class for you, only creating an open slot for you. You must register and secure the available slot.


##### How is the GPA calculated?
  * Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated by dividing the total number of quality points earned by the total number of GPA hours. Quality points are based on a four-point system and are awarded as follows:
A = 4  
B = 3  
C = 2  
D = 1  
F = 0
Each department has its own set of classes that make up their core for calculating core GPA. Refer to the respective department for department-specific policies regarding GPA (See CFR Undergraduate Handbook).
Example of GPA Calculation  
---  
Course | Grade | Calculation of Quality Points Earned  
(GPA Hours x Quality Points = Quality Points Earned)  
|  | GPA Hours | Quality Points | Quality Points Earned  
BIO 1203 | C | 3 | 2 | 6  
CH 1043 | C | 3 | 2 | 6  
EN 1113 | B | 3 | 3 | 9  
FO 1101 | B | 1 | 3 | 3  
MA 1313 | A | 3 | 4 | 12  
Total | 13 | 14 | 36 |   
GPA = Total Quality Points Earned ÷ Total GPA Hours  
GPA = 36 ÷ 13 = 2.77
