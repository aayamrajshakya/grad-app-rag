  * Doctor of Philosophy in Business Administration with a concentration in Finance


The department also participates in the interdisciplinary Master of Business Administration (MBA) program. See the College of Business Administration section of this publication for MBA and PhD information.
## Master of Arts in Economics
Because the Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in Economics is normally an incidental degree on the way to a doctoral degree, the Department of Finance and Economics does not typically offer a terminal M.A. degree. In rare circumstances, the Graduate Coordinator may approve an application for a terminal M.A. degree. However, in almost all cases, graduate students will earn the M.A. on the way to receiving their doctoral degree or if they leave the Ph.D. program after completing all necessary requirements for the M.A.
