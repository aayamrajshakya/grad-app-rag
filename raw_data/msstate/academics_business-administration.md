The Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a major in Business Administration gives students the flexibility to gain a general knowledge of various aspects of the business world. Also described as “general business,” the Business Administration major is the most popular and most flexible program we offer. This major teaches students the universal functions of business, such as planning, organizing, staffing, directing, controlling, and budgeting—as well as how to organize these resources efficiently.
After learning each of these disciplines, you will then select three areas for an additional specialization, completing these courses during your junior and senior years at MSU. You can choose from accounting, business law, economics, finance, information systems, international business, management, marketing, real estate, and risk management & insurance.
By selecting your three areas, you can customize the Business Administration to fit your needs. For example, if you wanted to be an entrepreneur or run your own business, you might pick management, marketing, and business law. Are you interested in financial services? Choose finance, real estate, or risk management & insurance. To work for a large company with a global market, you might choose international business, marketing, and management. For a career as a business analyst/ consultant, you could choose finance, accounting, and economics.
