### Students Get Hands-On with Robotics Through SmartTech MS
Students at the Baldwyn Career Advancement Center are the first in Mississippi to gain hands-on experience with advanced robotics through a new equipment loan program from SmartTech MS, a project funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engine Development award to the MSU Advanced Research and Development Corporation.
SmartTech MS purchased an Otto Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) and a FANUC collaborative robot to rotate among schools. The program allows students to work directly with robotics technology that mirrors today’s advanced manufacturing industries. To support classroom integration, the MSU Research and Curriculum Unit developed curriculum for the program and provided training for instructors.
“This is a great opportunity to further expose these students to the new technology that is found in industry today,” said Danny Ramsey, Career and Technical Education Director. “It will give them a step ahead by being able to put their hands on it and program it. I think it will motivate them to pursue fields in advanced manufacturing.”
“Students will have the opportunity to interact with this technology here in a K12 space, an opportunity typically only available in college.” Said Raymond Craven, Superintendent of the Baldwyn School District. “Hopefully, through this opportunity and partnership, our students will see what’s out there in terms of careers in advanced manufacturing and engineering and be able to make better, more informed decisions in college that will lead them to a high-paying STEM career.”
Students interested in continuing their training beyond high school can advance through the state-funded AiM UP programs at The Communiversity, Northeast Mississippi Community College, Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College, and Hinds Community College.
With support from the National Science Foundation Engine Development Award granted to the MSU Advanced Research and Development Corporation, SmartTech MS and its partners are helping Mississippi students build critical skills in robotics and automation while preparing the workforce of tomorrow.
### Empowering Futures Through Electrical Training
SmartTech MS, in collaboration with East Mississippi Community College and The Mission—a faith-based residential treatment program in West Point—is delivering hands-on electrical skills training to program participants. This pilot initiative offers instruction in Commercial/Residential Electrical and Industrial Motor Controls, led by EMCC instructor Cecil Pittman, who is conducting weekly classes on-site through June.
Trainees, including inaugural participants Stillman Underwood and Derek Mitchell, will soon advance to working with AC/DC circuits, relays, and motor controls using an Amatrol electrical trainer, made possible by a National Science Foundation (NSF) Engine Development Award awarded to the MSU Advanced Research and Development Corporation. ““SmartTech Mississippi is excited to be partnering with The Mission and EMCC in an electrical skills development program that could lead participants in one of several future workforce directions.” MSU Vice-President of Research and Development Dr. Julie Jordan said.

### SmartTech MS Technology Conference Showcases Cutting-Edge Manufacturing Innovations
Manufacturing technical staff, plant managers, and industry leaders explored emerging technologies and high-tech operational solutions that are reshaping modern manufacturing during the inaugural SmartTech MS conference.
"Industries were willing to share, and they wanted to learn from each other," said Julie Jordan, Vice President of Research and Economic Development at Mississippi State University, about the conference held on January 23, 2025, at the NISSAN Training Center in Canton, Miss.
Survey data found that most respondents who attended the conference were extremely satisfied and achieved their goals of learning about new technologies and exploring solutions to existing manufacturing challenges.
"One of the most important takeaways is that they are using this conference to develop industry 4.0 strategies that can be implemented in their manufacturing facilities,” said Tonya McCall, Director of the Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems – Extension at Mississippi State University, emphasizing the conference’s practical impact.
With 88 attendees representing 52 companies—both large and small—the conference fostered dynamic discussions on integrating advanced solutions into operations. The event featured four expert-led panels covering:
  * The Current State of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing
  * Autonomous Technologies in Industry 4.0: Revolutionizing Modern Manufacturing
  * Vision Systems in Smart Manufacturing: Enhancing Precision, Quality, and Automation
  * AI in Smart Manufacturing: Driving Innovation and Productivity


Beyond panel discussions, breakout sessions delved into specialized topics such as collaborative robots (cobots), digital twins, virtual safety, and AI-driven predictive maintenance. Attendees had the opportunity to learn about cutting-edge advancements, including autonomous mobile robots and the Mississippi Artificial Intelligence Network’s role in workforce development.
The organization operates through an Engines Development Award investment from the National Science Foundation in partnership with the Mississippi State University Advanced Research and Development Corporation.
