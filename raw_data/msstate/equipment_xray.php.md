### X-Ray Diffractometer
Rigaku SmartLab X-ray Diffraction System  
  
X-ray Diffractometers (XRD) are used to analyze and measure the structure of materials. XRD is the only laboratory technique that accurately and nondestructively collects information including crystal structure, composition, and orientation of powder, solid, and liquid samples. This is done by the X-rays produced by the source to illuminate the sample, diffracted by the sample phase, then enters the detector.   
  
The XRD can be used for a variety of techniques including powder diffraction (focusing beam), Powder diffraction (parallel beam), small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), thin film diffraction (in-plane), thin film diffraction (high-resolution), thin film diffraction (glancing incidence), X-ray reflectometry, in-plane diffraction, Rietveld analysis, texture/pole figures, residual stress analysis, and reciprocal space maps for film epitaxy, thickness, lattice tilt, and crystal perfection.
