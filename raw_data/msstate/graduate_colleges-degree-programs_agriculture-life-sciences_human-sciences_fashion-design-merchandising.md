The graduate degree (M.S.) in Fashion Design and Merchandising (FDM) will be offered through the School of Human Sciences with two concentrations: (1) Design & Product Development and (2) Merchandising. FDM is based on an interdisciplinary approach to understand design, product development, fashion businesses, consumer behavior, and related industries in the context of fashion culture in society. Graduates will become future leaders in the textile, apparel, and retail industries to promote the economic development of industry sectors that increase the quality of life for people around the world. They will also advance research and policy in areas related to the fashion industry to broaden the effects of academic application of research in practice, as well as governmental actions on the fashion complex. This degree is designed to provide students with an in-depth understanding of the fashion and retail industry, consumer behavior, product development, business principles, and technology applications. Students select a concentration in one of two areas: Design and Product Development or Merchandising.
