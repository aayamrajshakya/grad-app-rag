#  Types of Federal Student Loans
Federal student loans are available to help students and their families cover the cost of higher education. These student loans offer long-term, low-interest financing to eligible students. To qualify for federal student loans, students must be enrolled at least half-time (6 credit hours for undergraduates or 5 credit hours for graduate students) each term. Unlike grants or scholarships, loans must be repaid, with repayment typically beginning six months after the student leaves school, graduates, or drops below half-time enrollment.
