#  Technology Requirements
The Department of Communication requires Communication majors to purchase certain technology, equipment and software necessary for production and presentation of projects within departmental courses.required to have a personal laptop[department's mandated hardware and technical specifications](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/technology-requirements#hardware-min-specs). Having a laptop that meets these technical specifications ensures performance, usability, and compatibility with the various programs and software students will use to create and present projects within departmental courses, both inside and outside the classroom. Desktop systems or tablets will _not_ be acceptable in terms of meeting the department’s technology requirements.
Students are highly recommended to purchase one of the [department’s suggested personal laptop systems](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/technology-requirements#recommended-laptops) to guarantee compatibility and smooth operation with the various professional software packages used in the field of communication. Students must bring these computers to specific Communication (CO) classes[list of CO classes](https://www.comm.msstate.edu/concentrations/technology-requirements#software-course) that require laptop use with specifications on the software required on those laptops. 
#### Department of Communication Laptop & Camera Requirement Policy
The Mississippi State University Department of Communication requires that its students purchase a personal laptop that adheres to department-mandated technical specifications and specific software packages. In addition, upon enrollment in CO 3403 Photographic Communication or CO 4423 Adv Photo Communication, the Department of Communication requires that its students purchase a 35 mm-style digital single-lens reflex (dSLR) camera.
All Communication majors and students wishing to pursue a minor in Communication, along with students pursuing a GLA (General Liberal Arts), BSIS (Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies), Sports Administration, Agricultural Communication, or another degree program with a Department of Communication component are required to meet the equipment and software requirements set for CO majors. Non-CO majors taking Communication (CO) classes that utilize these technology requirements will also need to meet these requirements.
The Department of Communication’s computer and camera requirements for its classes can be found in the university catalog and are effective immediately upon students' enrollment into their first semester of Communication (CO) courses. Further information related to the department’s technology requirements is posted on the department's website. Details about equipment and hardware specifications, software subscriptions and applications required in its classes are reviewed and updated every spring semester.
These requirements reflect those found at other competitive institutions of higher education. Students within the Department of Communication will utilize this technology to produce classroom projects and assignments. These requirements will help students excel in their courses at Mississippi State and as professionals in their respective fields after graduation. 
#### Financial Aid: Purchasing Equipment & Software
Funds from most financial aid programs and scholarships can help offset the cost of purchasing equipment and technology required by a student’s major. Students should contact the [MSU Student Financial Aid and Scholarship](https://www.sfa.msstate.edu/resources/aid-disbursement/ "MSU Student Financial Aid and Scholarship Office") office to see if their funding programs cover the costs of purchasing required equipment in part or in full. Their office can also help students find more information about how to apply for additional funding that can help with the cost of purchasing department-required equipment and technology.
#### Course/Lab Fees
Additional fees associated with class materials and technology are required for certain department classes. These fees, which vary by course, are automatically charged to the student as part of registration. Information about the course/lab fees for a specific class can be found in the “Fees” section in the popup dialogue box when a class is clicked on when browsing classes in Banner via the Master Class Schedule or Registration portal.

### Computers & Hardware NOT Acceptable:
#### iPads & Tablets
iPads or Microsoft Tablets are not personal laptops and are not on the approved computer hardware list for Communication majors. These devices tend to have older and/or slower processors and are incompatible with graphics-intensive programs. They are designed for extended battery life and/or for word-processing applications and general use.
#### Macbooks & MacBook Airs
The MacBook Pro is the recommended laptop computer for students in Broadcasting & Digital Journalism, Print & Digital Journalism, or Public Relations. The MacBook and MacBook Air models are not recommended for students in those concentrations. They have older and/or slower processors and are not optimized for graphics-intensive programs. They are designed for extended battery life and/or for word-processing applications and general use.
#### Laptops Older Than 3 Years
Computers older than three model years may not adequately run the Adobe Creative Cloud due to older processors and other hardware issues. Most classes requiring Adobe CC are upper-division (junior/senior level) classes. It is suggested that students purchase their recommended laptop once they begin the sequence of classes requiring the Adobe CC software.
