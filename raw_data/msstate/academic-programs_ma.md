The Department of Political Science offers the Master of Arts in Political Science degree with a diverse faculty maintaining a broad research agenda.
The degree is intended to prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching, and professional careers in public service or the private sector. It may thus serve the needs of both students and practitioners of government, politics, and business. The degree program has a favorable faculty-to-student ratio, which permits students to have close contact with faculty. We enroll students from Mississippi, as well other states and countries. Many MA graduates enroll in law school or pursue Ph.D. degrees in political science. Students take 30 to 33 hours, depending on the thesis or non-thesis option. Students opting out of the thesis must pass comprehensive exams on all coursework.
A competitive applicant for the Master of Arts in Political Science program must have completed the last two years of undergraduate work with a grade point average of 3.00; an applicant with previous graduate work must have a grade point average of 3.00 on such coursework. Moreover, the applicant must submit three letters of recommendation. An applicant with a lower grade point average may be admitted if he or she has a competitive score on the Miller Analogies Test or on the verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing portions of the GRE.
Any international applicant whose native language is not English must submit scores that are not more than two years old from either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) or the International English Language Testing Systems (IELTS). These applicants must achieve a score of 600 PBT (100 iBT) on the TOEFL or 7.5 on the IELTS.
