#  Budgeting
Because the University is subject to federal cost accounting standards, as well as to university and sponsor guidelines, all budgets must be prepared in collaboration with and approved by Office of Sponsored Projects before being submitted to sponsors.
Getting Started:
  * Read the RFP (Request for Proposal) for the budget criteria. Often included are limits on the types of expenses, spending caps on certain expenses, and overall funding limits.
  * Identify all of the costs that are necessary and reasonable to complete the work described in your proposal.
  * The best strategy is to request a reasonable amount of money to do the work, not more and not less.
