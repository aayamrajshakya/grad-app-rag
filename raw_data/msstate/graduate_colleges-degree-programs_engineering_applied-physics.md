## An Interdisciplinary Program
An interdisciplinary program leading to the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering with a concentration in Applied Physics is available. A specific program, depending on the research interest of the student, is established by consultation between the student and his/her advisor. 
Major areas of study include the following:
Astrochemistry  
Astrophysics  
Computational physics  
Condensed matter physics  
Experimental and theoretical nuclear physics  
Experimental and theoretical optics  
Experimental atomic, molecular, optical, and plasma physics   
Experimental nanomaterials and nanoelectronics
Graduate research and teaching assistantships are available. For a complete listing of requirements and other pertinent information, please reference information provided in [Physics and Astronomy](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/arts-sciences/physics-astronomy/), College of Arts and Science, located in this publication.
