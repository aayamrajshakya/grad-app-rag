## Successful Graduates

### Where are they now?
Jack Ellington came to the MABM program in a job he wasn’t satisfied with and didn’t want to limit his career advancement opportunities. Once he entered the program, he quickly learned he was in the right place. Before graduating, he already had a job lined up in agricultural management! Now, he is a sales manager for Pilgrim’s Pride in Colorado and feels his degree helps him connect with people, even before they’ve met.
Louis Holbrook began his journey in the MABM program unsure of how it would truly benefit him. After entering the program, though, he quickly found the allure companies have with a MABM graduate. Prior to graduation, he had multiple job offers and decided to take one as an economic research analyst with Staplcotn, a regional cotton cooperative. Reflecting on his time in the MABM program he stated, “The MABM program prepared me in almost every way for the role I took at Staplcotn.” He has also seen multiple raises during his continued career with Staplcotn, which presented itself directly through the MABM program.

## A Program with You in Mind
We understand the job market can be tough. With instructors who have worked in the private sector, we know the tools you will need to be successful in your career. That is why our MABM program combines core MBA courses in accounting, finance, and marketing along with graduate courses in agricultural economics.
### On-Campus
Come and prepare yourself for the unique challenges faced in the agribusiness industry through our traditional, on-campus MABM program. Instead of feeling overwhelmed and ill-prepared to move forward in your career, work with professors in a face-to-face environment that allows you to understand your uniqueness in a different light. When you finish your degree, you can walk away confident that you are prepared to handle anything.

## The Degree
On campus students begin the MABM program during the first summer term. In the two weeks prior to the start of the program students attend one week of MBAMath during which prerequisite deficiencies can be addressed, followed by a mandatory one-week orientation known as Springboard Week. 
Springboard Week is an intensive professional development series featuring seminars on career management, personal branding, professional presentation skills, etiquette and networking, conflict negotiation, and team development. Students also participate in both individual and team speaking competitions. A required fee for Springboard Week will be specified upon admission to the program. 
Online students can start the program at the beginning of any semester. 
The MABM degree requires 31 hours of coursework, which may include an internship. The Department of Agricultural Economics does not provide assistantships for students in the MABM program. However, students may hold assistantships offered by other units on campus.
