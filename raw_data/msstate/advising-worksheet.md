# Advising Worksheet
Use this sheet when you meet with your advisor to talk about classes for the following semester. Make sure to use your resources to help, such as DegreeWorks and your major's curriculum sheets or guidelines. DegreeWorks can be found in your myState account. Curriculum sheets can be found on departmental websites. Some departments also have their own advising sheets, so make sure to check for those as well.
