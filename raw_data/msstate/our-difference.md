##  Our  
History 
In 2004, MSU established the College of Architecture, Art, and Design. Previous to this creation, the college was known as the School of Architecture, housing a professional undergraduate program and a nonprofessional Master of Science in Architecture.
Joining these two programs were the Interior Design Program, formerly from the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, and the Department of Art, formerly from the College of Arts and Sciences. In 2007, the Mississippi Institute for Higher Learning Board approved the formation of the undergraduate program in Building Construction Science

##  Collaboration 
The college values collaboration between majors, across campus, and with industry professionals. In their senior year, students from all of our disciplines come together to work in teams on a competitive design project. Sponsored by the Birmingham, AL-based construction firm Brasfield and Gorrie, the project winners receive scholarship money to put toward their studies!
Construction and Architecture students come together for two full semesters in our innovative Collaborative Studio to work together on actual design-build projects. Past projects include designing and building bus shelters for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, restroom facilities and golf cart shelters for the university golf course, facilities on campus, a shelter for the Boy Scouts of America, and more.
