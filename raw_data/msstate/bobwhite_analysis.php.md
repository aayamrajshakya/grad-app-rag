# Data Analysis
[](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/)Analyses of breeding season and fall covey survey data collected as part of the CP-33 Monitoring Program are conducted using a 3-tiered approach. Results are generated program-wide, regionally (within each [Bird Conservation Region (BCR)](http://www.nabci-us.org/bcrs.html)), and within each state. Density estimates are obtained for fall covey data, and for species with adequate numbers of detections in the breeding season using program [Distance 6.0](http://www.ruwpa.st-and.ac.uk/distance/).
We use conventional distance sampling (CDS) and multiple covariate distance sampling (MCDS) in program Distance 6.0 to estimate a detection function for each species of interest based on the probability of detecting a singing male or calling covey at a given radial distance (m) from the survey point. Breeding season species of interest for all BCR's/states included northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianusSturnella magnaTyrannus tyrannusSpiza AmericanaSpizella pusillaAmmodramus savannarumPooecetes gramineusPasserina cyaneaPasserina cirisTyrannus forficatus
For breeding season species of interest that do not have adequate sample sizes to generate density estimates, we estimate relative abundances using a Poisson regression (with a log-link function). Pairwise random effects are included based on paired CP33 and control fields. Data sets with a consistent number of survey repetitions were treated with repeated measures random effects.
