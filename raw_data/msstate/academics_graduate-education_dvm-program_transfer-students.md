#  Transfer Students
The Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine accepts, on a limited basis, transfer students from other veterinary medical colleges to fill vacancies in the freshmen or sophomore classes. We only fill vacancies in Year 1 or Year 2 of the program.
## Transfer Guidelines
  * Applicants seeking to transfer into Year 1 or Year 2 must have successfully completed coursework equivalent to the coursework which MSU CVM students will have already completed.
  * When applicable, equivalent surgery laboratory experience will be required.


Prior to application, it is advisable to contact MSU CVM to inquire if there are any vacancies and to allow our admissions staff to perform a review of equivalent courses to ensure that transfer is possible.

## Considerations
  * Any applicant considered for transfer admission must be in good academic standing (defined as being eligible to continue at current school from current point in the curriculum), never have failed a course while in veterinary medical school, and never have been dismissed from a veterinary school.
  * Any applicants considered for transfer admission will be required to participate in an interview either on-site at MSU CVM or via Skype, etc.
  * Typically, transfer applicants are not accepted into our program at a point later than first semester of Year 2.
  * Any student accepted for transfer is required to meet the current computer requirements of MSU CVM.
