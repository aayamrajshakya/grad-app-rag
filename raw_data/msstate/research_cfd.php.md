### Fluid Structure Interaction
Manav Bhatia’s research focuses on the development of computational methods for large-scale multiphysics systems exhibiting complex nonlinear dynamic phenomena, particularly involving fluid-structure interactions. In addition to the development of efficient predictive methods based on advanced finite-element discretizations, sensitivity analysis procedures are also investigated to enable gradient-based design-optimization of engineering systems. Dr. Bhatia is the developer of MAST that is an open-source toolkit for analysis and design of nonlinear multiphysics systems.
