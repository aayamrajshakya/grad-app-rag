# Research Overview
Most research in the Department is supported by government agencies or industries. Research expenditures within the ECE Department exceeds $12 million per year. Research facilities include the [High Voltage Laboratory (HVL)](https://www.ece.msstate.edu/high-voltage-lab/), a unique facility housed in the department, which is the largest HVL facility among North American universities. Other MSU research facilities are closely affiliated with the ECE Department include the [Geosystems Research Institute (GRI)](http://www.gri.msstate.edu/), the [Center for Advanced Vehicular System (CAVS)](http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/), and the [Distributed Analytics and Security Institute (DASI)](http://www.dasi.msstate.edu/). The mission of the research units at Mississippi State University is to provide an interdisciplinary research and learning environment.The units have established a tradition of excellence at Mississippi State University and across the nation. Take a look at what all we have to offer our students.
## Emphasis Areas
