# Bully
Each year, around five students don shaggy tan uniform to play roles of mascot Bully for MSU Alumni Association activities and other university functions, including pre-game home football and basketball games and other athletic events. For their demanding efforts, each receives a semester scholarship and support to attend a summer cheerleader training camp.
