#  Training in Ethics Research
## Training for PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS and co-PIs:
The Principal Investigator and co-PIs on covered NSF, NIH, and NIFA proposals shall complete the requirement for RCR training before the Office of Sponsored Projects will release an award. Training is accomplished through:
  1. Completion of an online course delivered through Canvas; and
  2. Completion of an online RCR course through the CITI website.


It is highly recommended that training is completed soon after a proposal is submitted to minimize delays in awarding. The Principal Investigator will receive notification from the Office of Sponsored Projects regarding this training requirement upon the submission of a proposal.

## Training for OTHER PROJECT PERSONNEL:
Other project personnel (not PIs or co-PIs) should complete the RCR training requirement via one of two options:
  1. CITI online certification in RCR plus[seminars](https://www.orc.msstate.edu/training) covering ethical issues (8 sessions for NIH projects); or
  2. Enrollment in an [approved ](https://www.orc.msstate.edu/sites/www.orc.msstate.edu/files/inline-files/RCR%20Course%20Swaps_1.21.pdf)1-hour or 3-hour credit course in Research Ethics. The course must be face-to-face; it cannot be online.


Other project personnel should complete the on-line CITI training component within the first 90 days of appointment to a covered project. The face-to-face training component should be completed within the first 12 months of appointment to a covered project.
