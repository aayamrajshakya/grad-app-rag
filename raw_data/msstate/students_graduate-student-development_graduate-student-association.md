#  Graduate Student Association
The Graduate Student Association (GSA) provides programs and services to enrich the graduate student experience and promotes, supports, and represents graduate student interests and values. The GSA sponsors two main events annually to enhance student experience and showcase student achievements, the Graduate Student Research Symposium and the Graduate Student Awards Banquet. The GSA also meets monthly to provide a forum for graduate students to network with peers, learn of valuable campus support services, and express concerns on both academic and non-academic issues. For more information email GSA@grad.msstate.edu.
To submit questions or concerns to the GSA, please visit the GSA Contact Portal or email them directly at GSA@grad.msstate.edu.
