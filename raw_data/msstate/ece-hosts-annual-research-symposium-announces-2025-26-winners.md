     * ECE Hosts Annual Research Symposium, Announces 2025-26 Winners


#  ECE Hosts Annual Research Symposium, Announces 2025-26 Winners
_
October 6, 2025
_
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering recently announced the winners of its 2025-26 ECE Research Symposium. The annual symposium is open to all ECE graduate, undergraduate and distance students to showcase their research through poster presentations.
This year’s event was judged by ECE department faculty members Dylan Boyd, Junming Diao, Jenny Du and Chaomin Luo.
First-place winner and graduate student Bruce Hicks
Bruce Hicks
Hicks, whose major professor is John Ball, was recognized with first place for “Time-Gated Complex Parameterized Learnable Filters for Modulation Recognition.” His work presents TG-PLFNet, a physics-informed deep learning model for automatic modulation recognition that operates directly on raw I/Q data. By combining learnable time and frequency filters with complex-valued CNNs, the model achieves high accuracy, efficiency and interpretability across diverse radar and communication signals.
In addition to the first-place award, the panel of judges also presented second and third place.
Hossein Mohammadi and Fahad Faisal
Second prize was presented to Hossein MohammadiFahad Faisal
Their research presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for achieving RFI-resilient passive sensing and active–passive spectrum coexistence in shared 5G environments. Using a precision 5G NR testbed and open-source datasets, it demonstrates adaptive spectrum management that mitigates interference impacts on radiometers and other passive sensors.
