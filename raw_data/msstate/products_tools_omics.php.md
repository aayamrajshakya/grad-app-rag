## Omics and Bioinformatics Products & Tools
[](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/data-products/#omicsdata)
#### Omics Data Portal
This Portal provides access to projects and data from the Omics program at the Atlantic Oceanography and Meteorology Laboratory (AOML). The Program promotes coral resilience, develops and transfers emerging technologies, advances Omics for fisheries and microbiome applications, and fosters the bioinformatics and infrastructure capabilities for Omics research.

#### Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) Data Repository
describes how the EMP catalogue is generated and how to use it. The EMP dataset is generated from samples that individual researchers have compiled and contributed.

#### Tutorials for Data Science & Bioinformatics
features tutorials and crash courses for common computing environments, programs, or languages that are useful for data science.
[](https://github.com/noaa-aoml/tourmaline)
#### Tourmaline Bioinformatics Workflow Tool
allows rapid and reproducible analysis of amplicon sequence data that uses QIIME 2 and the software packages it wraps. Tourmaline manages commands, inputs, and outputs using the Snakemake workflow management system.

#### HUMAnN 2.0
is a pipeline for efficiently and accurately profiling the presence/absence and abundance of microbial pathways in a community from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic sequencing data. This process, referred to as functional profiling, aims to describe the metabolic potential of a microbial community and its members. More generally, functional profiling answers the question “What are the microbes in my community-of-interest doing (or capable of doing)?”
