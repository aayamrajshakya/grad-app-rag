# Electrical Engineering
Electrical engineering concerns itself with the science and engineering techniques dealing with electrons and other charged particles, with their behavior and effects, and especially with the control of them. Only in the last seventy-five years have people learned to use electricity to provide power, heat, light, and communication to ease their burdens. In recent times have come the developments of radar, television, automatic control systems, high-speed computers, transistors, and the whole family of solid state devices. The challenge of the future is limitless.
  * Electrical Engineering: The branch of engineering concerned with the design development, and practical application of electrical devices and systems, and with the use of electrical energy.
  * The largest of all engineering disciplines
