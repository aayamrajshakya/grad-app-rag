## Remote Sensing Toolkit (RST) to Incorporate Planetary Data
#### Overview
NASA’s Technology Transfer Program ensures that innovations developed for exploration and discovery are broadly available to the public, maximizing the benefit to the nation. This project aims to identify, assess, categorize, and describe NASA’s remote sensing tools to promote broader utilization and economic benefits of this technology. The primary task associated with this work include:   
  

  * Execute a coordinated, systematic, comprehensive search strategy to identify candidate tools in the areas of Planetary Science. This will include an assessment of each candidate entry to determine which items should be included in the RST.
  

  * Develop a categorization strategy for each tool to be included in the RST by conducting a thorough review of planetary data information sources and tools.
  

  * Categorize each tool to help users quickly and easily navigate through the contents of the RST. Each tool should briefly describe the included information for to help users make appropriate selections.
  

  * Work with Ames Research Center to incorporate planetary data sources into the RST.
  

  * Work with NASA to generate strategies to maintain the current content for the RST portal.
