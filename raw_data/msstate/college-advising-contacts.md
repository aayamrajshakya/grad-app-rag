### How to Request an Override
It is important to know that only the department that teaches the course has the authority to grant an override. For example, if you are trying to register for SO 1103, only the Sociology Department can grant a corresponding override for that course. 
#### When Requesting an Override, Always Include:
  * Student Name
  * Student netID
  * Course Code including Prefix, Course Number, and Section Number
  * Semester: Winter, Spring, Summer (include term), Fall
  * Type of Override
  * Reason for Request
  * Example: Bully Bulldog, bbd1878, EN 1113 sec 05, Spring semester, prerequisite override - I completed English Comp I at community college


Once an override has been placed on your record, you must register for the course online in the same way that you register for any other course.
Please keep in mind that not all override requests can be granted.

### Capacity Override Information 
Please utilize the Wait List option for all Capacity 
  * To join a Starkville campus College of Business course, you must follow the waitlist instructions.
  * If a seat becomes available, then the first student on the waitlist will receive an email from MSU's Registrar's Office stating you can add the course within 24 hours. This time limit will be shortened during the first week of class.
  * This process is handled automatically by Banner 9 registration. You will not need to contact the instructor, department, or college office about a waitlist.
  * A student may be enrolled in one section and on the waitlist for one other section of the same course. After receiving a notification to add the waitlisted section, the student must first drop the original section before adding the new one.
