## Make a Difference
HDFS is an interdisciplinary lifespan approach to the study of children, youth, and families. It encompasses specialty areas in infant and child studies, youth studies, family studies, family resource management, and gerontology. Graduates will make a difference in the lives of children, youth, and their families. They will become future leaders who will develop, manage, and evaluate early childhood, youth development, family support, and community-based programs. They will advance research and policy in areas related to young children, youth, and families.
### What do our graduates think of the program? 
"My experience in this program was nothing less than outstanding! I had the opportunity to work with professors who placed real value on student success while maintaining the utmost integrity. My education at MSU has helped me advance in my work in the early childhood education field. Thank you to the HDFS graduate program for giving me an outstanding educational opportunity. Hail State!"
"I wanted a graduate degree program that would help equip me to strengthen families and communities. I found that and more in the HDFS program at Mississippi State."
"The master's program provided me a more in-depth look at the different issues as well as solutions in order to care for children and families. I was also able to learn what areas really interest me the most, which has empowered me to know how I want to serve children and families."
"The HDFS master's program truly helped define who I am as a scholar, teacher, and leader. The department is like a family, and I experienced incredible support from all faculty and staff. I'm so thankful for the experience I had in the program and how it enables me to serve others."
"I was not confident to pursue a master's degree since I had completed my undergraduate degree four years earlier in another discipline. The faculty provided the confidence and preparation to take my GRE, pursue a research topic that interested me, and successfully complete my thesis. I appreciate the variety of research areas I was exposed to, thought-provoking discussions that helped me see issues from a variety of viewpoints, and opportunities to apply the theories and concepts learned. I am proud to be an HDFS alumna."
