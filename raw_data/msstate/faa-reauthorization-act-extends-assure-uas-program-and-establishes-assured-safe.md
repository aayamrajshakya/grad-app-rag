## FAA Reauthorization Act Extends ASSURE UAS Program and Establishes ASSUREd Safe
STARKVILLE, Miss. 
Senator Roger Wicker, the senior senator representing Mississippi and a senior member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, championed this legislation.
“Mississippi State University continues to be a leader in the FAA’s Centers of Excellence program for unmanned aircraft system research. This legislation will keep the university at the epicenter of aviation innovation, and I am proud to have supported it.”
U.S. Senator Roger Wicker
Mississippi State University is recognized as the leading university for the ASSURE program and has played a pivotal role since the program’s foundation.
“I have had the privilege of being involved with the ASSURE program since its inception, and it has been truly remarkable to witness the growth and significant impact the program has had on the UAS industry. From the outset, the program’s mission has been clear: to provide high-quality research and support to autonomy stakeholders, both domestically and internationally, in order to safely and efficiently integrate autonomous systems into the national and international infrastructure.” 
Dr. David Shaw
Provost and Executive Vice President at Mississippi State University
Comprised of 29 of the world’s leading research institutions and more than a hundred leading industry and government partners, ASSURE is at the forefront of UAS research and development. With a comprehensive portfolio spanning from small drones to large-scale UAS, ASSURE members contribute invaluable expertise across various research domains.
The extension of the ASSURE program aligns with the overarching goal of supporting the growth of the UAS market into its multi-billion-dollar potential. By conducting research that prioritizes safety, effectiveness, and efficiency, ASSURE aims to facilitate the seamless integration of UAS alongside manned aircraft worldwide.
“ASSURE is not only about advancing technology, but also about increasing commerce and enhancing overall public safety and benefit. As we continue to navigate the complexities of UAS integration, I am thrilled to see the great work of the ASSURE program persist and evolve. Together, we are shaping the future of autonomous systems and paving the way for a safer, more interconnected world.” 
Col. Stephen P. Luxion, Ret.
Executive Director, ASSURE FAA Center of Excellence for UAS
The FAA Reauthorization Act has also established a pivotal credentialing authority within the FAA’s program of record known as ASSUREd Safe. This national credentialing authority, which will be housed at the Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems at Mississippi State University, will provide essential services such as standards development, education, and testing tailored to equip first responders for diverse emergency response operations.
ABOUT ASSURE 
The Alliance for System Safety of UAS through Research Excellence (ASSURE), FAA’s Center of Excellence for UAS programs, encompasses 29 of the world’s premier research institutions and over a hundred leading industry and government partners. ASSURE members play a central role at four FAA UAS test sites, lead four FAA research centers, and have a multitude of UAS ranging from small drones below 55 pounds to the largest UAS at any US academic institution at 1800 pounds. By focusing on safety, effectiveness, and efficiency, ASSURE conducts research to support the FAA in seamlessly integrating UAS with manned aircraft worldwide. ASSURE also leads ASSUREd Safe, a federated ecosystem, to improve and standardize first responders’ use of UAS for public benefit, safety, and emergency response.
