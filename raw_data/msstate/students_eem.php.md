# Environmental Economics & Sustainability
* * *
* * *
When you think green, you should think money. Why? Because economic and environmental progress go together. The Environmental Economics and Sustainability major at Mississippi State University is designed for students who want to make a difference in the world now and in the future.
The need for efficient and productive management of natural and environmental resources is greater than ever before, and the training students receive in the Environmental Economics and Sustainability major prepares them for the challenge.
Students learn the skills they need through three major areas. The first is environmental science, where students learn fundamentals about biology, chemistry, and ecology. The second area is policy, where students take courses in government, law, and how they interact with the environment. The third area of the major is economics, which includes a course in natural resource economics. Graduates will be well-prepared to impact their world immediately or continue their education in graduate or law school.

## Environment & Sustainability Certificate Program

## Internships
Internships are designed to enhance the education of students through meaningful off-campus work experiences, and are open to qualified students. Students can earn 3 hour credits for an internship up to a total of 6 hours. An internship is an important part of the majors in Agricultural Economics as it provides an opportunity for students to apply classroom learning to the work place. The goal of internships is to provide students with valuable professional growth and development opportunities that prepare them for rewarding careers. Successful internships not only complement academic progress, but also provide employers a preview of prospective candidates for employment.
Eligible students are encouraged to seek entry-level positions with business firms, government agencies, and other organizations. The student and the prospective cooperator design a program that provides practical work experience focused on the specific goals and career objectives of the student.
For more information contact Dr. Josh Maples, [662.325.1774](tel:+01-662-325-1774), or josh.maples@msstate.edu. Current students interested in internships may [download the application](https://www.agecon.msstate.edu/pdf/students/internship_app.pdf) and return it to Dr. Maples.
