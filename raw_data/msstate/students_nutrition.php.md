# Nutrition and Dietetics
# Nutrition and Dietetics
The Food and Nutrition concentration is in the Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion major, and is an accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD). It focuses on the study of nutrients in food and their relationship to health and disease. Individuals with a degree in nutrition may be employed with state agencies, in food service, or with major food manufacturers. Many settings require individuals to hold the credential of registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). Registered dietitian nutritionists are nutrition experts who apply the science of nutrition by utilizing nutrition knowledge to promote health and/or treat disease. Registered dietitian nutritionists, sometimes referred to as registered dietitians or simply dietitians, work in hospitals, clinics, community settings, private consulting practices, sports nutrition and corporate wellness programs, food and nutrition-related businesses and industry, pharmaceutical companies, and more. 
The RDN credential requires the completion of a master’s degree and a supervised practice program. Supervised practice program entry is competitive, so students interested in this route should begin to prepare early for academic success.

  2. Complete an ACEND-accredited supervised practice program (most commonly dietetic internships). The Department of Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion at Mississippi State University offers a dietetic internship program. A GPA of 3.0 (B) is often listed as the minimum GPA considered by most Dietetic Internship programs.  
  

  3. Effective January 1, 2024, a graduate degree (in any field be required for RDN exam eligibility.*  
  

  4. Pass national RDN exam as set by the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR).  
  

  5. Meet state licensure requirements.   
  

     * As stated on the CDR website, “the majority of states have enacted laws which regulate the practice of dietetics. Should you plan to practice dietetics in these states it is important that you contact a state regulatory agency prior to practicing dietetics. In many states, it is a violation of state law to practice dietetics without a license. For information by state, check the [CDR State Licensure webpage](https://www.cdrnet.org/licensure).  

     * Note: The state of Mississippi does have practice exclusivity, meaning an individual must have a license to provide medical nutrition therapy. Details can be found in the [Regulations Governing Licensure of Dietitians](https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/135.pdf) document available through the Mississippi Department of Health Office of Licensure. 


> *Effective January 1, 2024, the Commission on Dietetic Registration (CDR) will require a minimum of a master's degree to be eligible to take the credentialing exam to become a registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN). In addition, CDR requires that individuals complete coursework and supervised practice in program(s) accredited by the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). Graduates who successfully complete the ACEND-accredited Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD) at Mississippi State University are eligible to apply to an ACEND-accredited supervised practice program. In most states, graduates also must obtain licensure or certification to practice. It is ACEND’s considered opinion that this program is designed to and does meet all state dietetics licensure and certification laws as some states may interpret their statutes differently.
