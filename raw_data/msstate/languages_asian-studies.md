# Asian Studies
The Asian region, broadly defined here – including East Asia, Southeast Asia, and South Asia – has a rich variety of languages, cultures, and literatures in the long history of their respective civilizations, and it is a region with continually growing importance in the contemporary global economy. 
The concentration in Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary program with a focus on Asia. It is based on a strong foundation of language, literature, and cultural studies. Students choose either Chinese (Mandarin) or Japanese, and take a minimum of 36 credit hours of coursework, including 3 years of study of the target language and elective East Asian literature and culture courses offered by CMLL faculty.
For the required 36 credit hours, students can also include courses offered outside CMLL in e.g. history, geography, and religion, with upper-division courses. Students in the Asian Studies concentration will thus build a strong foundation in one of the East Asian languages and literatures, have an understanding of the Asian region from multidisciplinary perspectives, and develop critical perspectives toward Asian literature, culture, and society. Students majoring in Asian Studies thus can pursue careers in a wide range of professional fields such as public service, journalism, international trade and manufacturing, information technology, education, media, law, and government.
## Degree Requirements
123 total degree hours consisting of a combination of 36 credit hours through a combination of FLC, FLJ and East Asian-focused courses, in addition to College of Arts & Sciences and University requirements.
