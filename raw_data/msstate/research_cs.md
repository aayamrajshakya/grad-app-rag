# Computational Sciences
Computational science (or scientific computing) is concerned with constructing mathematical models, quantitative analysis techniques, numerical simulations, and optimization to solve scientific problems using computers. It is now widely regarded as a third mode of scientific discovery, after theory and experiment. Faculty members in this area are participating in projects that involve algorithm development for performance optimization in scientific computing, software synthesis for computational field simulations on high-end computing platforms, distributed interactive simulation frameworks, resource allocation on high-end computing platforms, autonomic computing, uncertainty analysis in simulations, medical imaging analysis, and biological modeling.
