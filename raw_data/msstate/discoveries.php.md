##  MS Well Owner Network
Twelve percent of Mississippians rely on water from private wells for home use. Unlike public water supplies, which are tested for monthly for contaminants, private well owners are responsible for maintaining safe water supplies for themselves. The Mississippi Well Owner Network is a free educational training opportunity for Mississippi residents who want to become more familiar with groundwater resources, septic system maintenance, well maintenance, water quality, and water treatment.

##  SipSafe
The SipSafe program, conducted by the MSU Extension Service, is working to reduce lead exposure in children ages birth to 5 years by screening water in qualifying schools and child care facilities. While lead is a naturally occurring element, it can be toxic and harmful to human health.
