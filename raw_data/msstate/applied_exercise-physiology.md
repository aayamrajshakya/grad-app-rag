# Master's in Exercise Physiology
Exercise physiology is broadly based on basic sciences: human anatomy, physiology, chemistry, and biology, with the primary goal being to understand how various cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems respond to challenges posed by exercise and physical training.
Study in exercise physiology may center on understanding optimal performance such as that attained by elite and highly trained athletes and on performances and physiological adaptations of individuals with one or more chronic diseases. Exercise physiology has remained integrative, examining how the failure or enhancement of one physiological system can influence another. It also considers how the environment limits the body during exercise through such means as heat, cold, humidity, and altitude exposure. The exercise physiology program at Mississippi State University is designed to prepare students for careers as exercise physiologists serving in fitness centers, hospital-based wellness and clinical rehabilitation centers, schools, and universities. In addition, the program prepares students for advanced graduate study leading to the doctoral degree.
