### [Caya Perry](https://www.msstate.edu/student-testimonials/caya-perry)
“My experience in Thrive in Five has been tremendous. This is a great opportunity, and I am glad the offer was extended to the architecture department. My knowledge of landscape architecture has grown over the past couple of years and has become beneficial in my studies and projects. Also, I appreciate the small classes because it allows for a more intimate learning environment.” ~ Caya Perry, Landscape Architecture

### [Dylan Colucci](https://www.msstate.edu/student-testimonials/dylan-colucci)
“To me, the biggest benefit of the Thrive in Five program is that it makes graduate school an obtainable goal. Graduate school is expensive, and being able to start early at no extra cost is the only reason that I am able to continue my education beyond the undergraduate level.” ~ Dylan Colucci, Anthropology

### [Heston Lollar](https://www.msstate.edu/student-testimonials/heston-lollar)
“The faculty was top notch the entire way through my Thrive in Five program. They understood I was starting master’s classes as an undergraduate and knew how to meet me in the middle. They were even willing to meet with me one-on-one outside of class to help with the transition.” ~ Heston Lollar, Public Policy and Administration

##  Frequently Asked Questions   

##  Why should I consider Thrive in Five? 
Research shows that employees with a master’s degree earn an average of $689 more per week than workers with only a high school diploma. Over the course of a lifetime, this can make a huge difference in earnings and quality of life. Equipped with two degrees and valuable critical thinking skills, you’ll also be viewed by potential employers as a stronger candidate.
##  Who can enroll in Thrive in Five? 
Any undergraduate student who has completed at least 60 hours of coursework and has at least a 3.50 GPA can be a part of Thrive in Five. Each accelerated program has an advisor with specific details about the program that is right for you. Visit the Thrive in Five programs page to find the program advisor.
##  How do I begin my Thrive in Five journey? 
Contact the Thrive in Five program advisor to learn more about the program you want to pursue. Admission criteria may differ between programs and are determined by the departments. Visit the Thrive in Five programs page to find the program advisor.
##  May I take graduate-level courses while I’m an undergraduate student and count them toward both my undergraduate degree and my graduate degree? 
Yes. In fact, we encourage you to do so. Up to nine graduate credit hours can be applied toward each undergraduate and graduate degree. Requirements may vary depending on the Thrive in Five program you choose. Please contact the program advisor to ensure the graduate-level courses you choose will count toward the undergraduate degree requirements.
##  Am I assured admission into the MSU Graduate School if I pursue the Thrive in Five path? 
Each program offered has its own specific requirements for graduate admission, and the advisor for your program can help you with this process. Visit the Thrive in Five programs page to find the advisor for each program.
##  As a Thrive in Five participant, will I graduate with a bachelor's degree and master's degree at the same time? 
No. You’ll graduate with your bachelor's degree prior to earning your graduate degree.
##  What if I take graduate courses as an undergrad and then decide I don’t want to continue on into graduate school? 
That’s not a problem. You still will graduate with a bachelor’s degree because any graduate courses you’ve taken while in the Thrive in Five program will also satisfy your undergraduate requirements.
