## Get Started on Your Certificate Today!
Mississippi State University Online has created a first-of-its-kind Athlete Engineering research program from a collaboration between Mississippi State University Athletics, Bagley College of Engineering, the department of Kinesiology, and the school of Human Sciences. This research program uses both laboratory equipment and sport-specific wearable technologies to explore human performance.
The flexibility of the Athlete Engineering Certificate allows any Mississippi State Online student and practitioner across the worlds of sports, industry, and military to receive recognition for mastering human factors techniques and technology solutions focused on human performance outcomes as well as the comfort and fit versus effectiveness expectation.
The successful completion of the Athlete Engineering Certificate will expand students' foundation and understanding of the utilization of human performance, processes, and analysis methodologies within their fields.
