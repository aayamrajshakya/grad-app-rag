### X-Ray Computed Tomography (CT)
Nikon Metrology XTH 225 ST, Micro Focus X-Ray and CT inspection System  
  
X-Ray CT is a nondestructive technique that visualizes interior features within solid objects. This can be used to obtain information on the 3-D geometries as well as other properties. CT images are often referred to as slices as it corresponds to what the object scanned is opened on a plane. Strengths of the X-ray CT include little to no preparation, non-destructive 3-D imaging, and reconstructive is typically attenuation-conservative. However, large data volumes are required, finite resolution can cause blurring, resolution is limited to 1000-2000X, not all features will have a large enough attenuation contrast for imaging considered useful, and image artifacts like beam hardening might complicate data acquisition.
