## Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) &  
  
Dual Use Research of Concern (DURC)
The Federal Select Agent Program oversees select agents and biological toxins that pose a threat to public, animal, or plant health. Dual use research of concern (DURC) comprises experiments involving a subset of select agents that may be directly misapplied to pose a significant threat to public health, agriculture, the environment or national security.
