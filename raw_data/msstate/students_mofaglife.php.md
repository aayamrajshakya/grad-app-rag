  * A minimum 2.75 overall GPA on a 4.00 scale.
  * Scored results of the GRE general test recommended but not required.
  * International students are required to have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 500 PBT (61 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 5.5 (non-English speaking international students)


Provisional Admission:
The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student’s program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement.
