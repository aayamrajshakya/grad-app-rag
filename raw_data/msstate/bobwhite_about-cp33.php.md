# About CP33
## What is CP33?
In 2004, the United States Department of Agriculture-Farm Service Agency (FSA) established conservation practice Habitat Buffers for Upland Birds, or CP-33, under the Continuous Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). CP-33 aims to provide habitat for northern bobwhite and other upland birds via landowner incentives to establish native grass buffers along row-crop field margins. CP-33 is a "win-win" for producers—it allows retirement of unproductive field margins, often with net financial gains through practice incentives, while providing critical habitat for quail and other upland wildlife. 
## Why was CP-33 developed?

In response to the current bobwhite population decline, a range-wide, habitat-based population recovery plan called the [Northern Bobwhite Conservation Initiative (NBCI)](https://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/bobwhite/docs/Northern_Bobwhite_Conservation_Initiative.pdf) was developed by the Southeast Quail Study Group (SEQSG), now the [National Bobwhite Technical Committee (NBTC)](http://www.bobwhitetech.org/) in 2002. The NBCI provides regionally explicit habitat and population goals designed to recover bobwhites to average 1980 population densities on existing improvable acres.
The CP-33 practice was developed to directly address population recovery goals of the NBCI, by encouraging conservation practices that coexist with agricultural production. Economic incentives to create CP-33 upland habitat buffers around cropped fields are one method to increase early-successional habitats for bobwhite and upland songbirds with minimal or positive economic impact on producers and landowners.
## Where is CP-33 implemented?
FSA recently increased acreage allocation to 350,000 CP-33 acres in 35 states within the bobwhite's range to be actively managed over a period of 10 years (Figure 2). As of June 2010, 227,318 acres were enrolled in CP-33 in 25 states (Fig. 2). Under CP33, upland habitat buffers 30 - 120 feet wide can be established around part or all of the field margin of eligible croplands.

## What makes CP-33 unique?
[CP-33 monitoring program](https://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/bobwhite/index.php) and a [CP-33 monitoring protocol](https://www.fwrc.msstate.edu/bobwhite/docs/CP33%20Monitoring%20Protocol_03_22_06_FINAL.pdf) were developed by SEQSG and Southeast Partners in Flight in 2006, and coordinated through the Mississippi State University [Forest and Wildlife Research Center](http://fwrc.msstate.edu/).
