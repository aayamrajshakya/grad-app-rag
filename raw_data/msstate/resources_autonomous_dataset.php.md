## Open Source Datasets for Off-road Autonomous Vehicles
Researchers at CAVS have collected and labeled several datasets targeted towards off-road autonomous driving. These datasets consist of autonomous vehicle sensor data taken primarily in unstructured or off-road environments from sensors such as camera and GPS. These datasets are open source; we ask that researchers and developers appropriately reference the source when publishing or presenting work which makes use of this resource. 
### Off-road Autonomous Driving Segmentation Dataset
This dataset is comprised of two sets of segmentation data specially targeted for the unstructured, off-road driving environment. 
  * The first set is a real-world semantic segmentation dataset with 1077 images that were collected at the [CAVS proving grounds](https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/capabilities/proving_ground.php), which is a 55-acre area with trails, hills, obstacles, dense vegetation, similar to a forest environment. Data were collected during winter 2018 and summer 2019 using a Sekonix SF3325-100 GMSL camera mounted on the top of a Polaris Ranger crew XP100, capturing imagery at 10 frames per second. The images are semantically labeled using classes such as smooth trail, rough trail, small vegetation, forest, sky, and obstacles.
  

  * The second set is a synthetic dataset for semantic segmentation in unstructured driving environment generated using an in-house, physics-based, high-fidelity simulator, the [Mississippi State University Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS)](https://www.cavs.msstate.edu/capabilities/mavs.php). This set consists of 1,947 image pairs featuring different time of the day, lighting condition, plant density, cloud cover, and landscape.

### CaT: CAVS Traversibility Dataset
The off-road driving domain has many uncertainties such as uneven terrain structure, positive and negative obstacles, ditches, hidden objects, and many more. This dataset contains a set of segmented images, which are annotated by vehicle drivers according to their perception of the vehicle’s ability to drive through the terrain. It contains 12,300 two-dimensional camera images collected in three different locations around the CAVS proving ground. The images are annotated considering the traversing capability of three different vehicles: sedan, pickup, and off-road.
