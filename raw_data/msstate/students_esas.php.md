  3. Environmental Science in Agricultural Systems


# Environmental Science in Agricultural Systems
The Environmental Science in Agricultural Systems major provides an educational foundation to prepare students for diversified careers focused on environmental issues related to agronomic and horticultural production. Agriculture faces many challenges both now and into the future. The United Nations projects a vast increase in global population from 6.1 billion in 2000 to 8.9 billion in 2050, a 47% increase. The demand for increased agricultural production imposes a continuum of challenges over the well documented environmental concerns of the 21st century. Other environmental concerns include land use changes, pollution, ocean acidification, and water quantity and quality. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/environmental-scientists-and-specialists.htm): Occupational Outlook Handbook: The median annual wage for environmental scientists and specialists was $73,230 in May 2020. Employment of environmental scientists and specialists is projected to grow 8 percent from 2020 to 2030. Heightened public interest in the hazards facing the environment, as well as increasing demands placed on the environment by population growth, are expected to spur demand for environmental scientists and specialists.

## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates at Mississippi State University are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program. This program permits enrollment in graduate courses in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science during the student’s final year of undergraduate studies. Enrollment of up to 9 hours of graduate courses is approved for students admitted to the Accelerated Program. Upon completion of the graduate course(s), undergraduate credit is also awarded for the course. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the M.S. degree. Application to this program may be made as early as the end of the junior year (i.e., after completion of 90 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). This option is only available for students pursuing a thesis-based Master of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science.
