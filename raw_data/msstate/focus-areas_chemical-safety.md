Safety Data Sheets 
Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) are critical for providing information about the hazards, safe handling, and disposal of chemicals. Learn more about SDSs below.

Methylene Chloride 
EPA regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) restrict the use of methylene chloride (dichloromethane, DCM; CAS #75-09-2). These regulations not only apply to commercial/industrial products containing DCM, but also impact use in laboratory research settings.

Chemical Spills 
Responding to a chemical spill requires a carefully planned and executed strategy to minimize harm to individuals, property, and the environment.

Chemical Inventory 
A chemical inventory is a detailed account of all hazardous chemicals available on hand. Maintaining an accurate and authentic chemical inventory is crucial for cost-effective chemical management, minimizing accidents, encouraging proper handling and storage, and facilitating emergency response.
