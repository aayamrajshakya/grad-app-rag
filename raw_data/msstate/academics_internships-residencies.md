#  Internships and Residencies
The Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine hosts dynamic internship and residency programs. Among our six locations, the College currently has approximately one dozen interns and two dozen residents enrolled as house officers within various clinical and paraclinical programs.
Many of our interns have successfully moved onto highly competitive specialty residency training programs. Residents trained at MSU have moved on to become respected specialists in academia, in specialty referral practice, and in industry.
Many of our internship and residency programs are filled through the American Association of Veterinary Clinicians Veterinary Internship and Residency Matching Program. Currently listed positions can be found on their Match Program website at [virmp.org](https://virmp.org).
MSU CVM boasts an outstanding track record for matching our graduates into internships and residencies. We are one of only seven North American colleges of veterinary medicine that has averaged a greater than 70% successful matching rate for internships/residencies over the past eight years.
A large majority of MSU CVM graduates enter private practice immediately following graduation; however, for those that do seek additional clinical training because they want to specialize, our graduates are very successful.
