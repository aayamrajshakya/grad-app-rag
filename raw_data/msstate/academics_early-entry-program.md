## Interview
Interviews are a required part of the final process. Applicants selected for interviews will be invited to participate in a _virtual_ interview in late January. Interview invitations will be sent by email in mid-January with further details. After interviews have been completed, notifications regarding acceptance to the program will be emailed by mid-February.
* * *
## Acceptance into the EEP
Students who have an interest in veterinary medicine and meet application requirements during high school may apply for the Early Entry Program. If a student is accepted into this program, he or she begins undergraduate coursework at MSU after high school graduation and completes the first three to four years of prerequisite courses, while also working toward the completion of a bachelor’s degree. After the student has completed all prerequisite course requirements for the College of Veterinary Medicine and remains in good standing, he or she can enroll in the CVM as a pre-accepted student. No further application or interview to the CVM is required.
* * *
## Good Standing
An early entry student must remain in good standing to matriculate into the DVM program. Below are some requirements that EEP must meet to remain in good standing. 
  * Successfully complete a minimum of 14 credit hours each semester at MSU 
  * Earn no less than a 3.35 GPA in 
    * all college courses combined (cumulative GPA) 
    * all prerequisite courses (required courses GPA) 
    * all prerequisite math/science courses (required math/science courses GPA) 
  * Earn no less than a C- in all prerequisite courses 
  * Remain in good standing with the University 
  * Meet with their Early Entry Program advisor at least once each semester 
  * Document completion of at least 480 hours of experience under the supervision of a veterinarian in a clinical or scientific setting by January 31st of the year of matriculation into DVM program 
  * Refrain from enrolling full-time at an institution other than Mississippi State University 


* * *
## Residency
Prior to the final acceptance for admission, each successful applicant must enter a contract with the MSU CVM in which the applicant agrees and obligates himself/herself to pay the tuition, fees, and expenses applicable to the applicant's resident or non-resident status that exists at the time the applicant submits their Early Entry Matriculation Form. In addition, the applicant must agree and obligate himself/herself in the contract to continue to pay the tuition, fees and expenses during the applicant's entire MSU CVM DVM education experience that are applicable to that same initial status determination, thereby waiving any right to petition for a change in residency status for the purpose of calculating tuition.  
  
  
  
Please be aware that the Office of the Registrar at Mississippi State University processes petitions for Mississippi residency. Applicants that wish to be considered a Mississippi resident must be certified prior to the submission of their Early Entry Matriculation Form. If not certified, the applicant will be placed within the non-resident pool for that particular application cycle.  
  
  
  
An admitted applicant's status will not change for his or her entire MSU CVM veterinary medical educational period.  
  
  
  
MSU CVM reserves the right to decline admission or rescind an offer of admission if a candidate is found to have falsified or concealed pertinent requested information at any point during the admissions process.
* * *
## Contracts
MSU CVM has contracts with West Virginia. To be considered for these positions, applicants must contact their state agency and be certified as a resident of that state.  
  
  
  
[West Virginia applicants should complete the form here.](https://davismichael.wvu.edu/current-students/veterinary-school-information/contract-school-information)
  
  
This program is processed through West Virginia University but is open to WV residents attending any institution.  
  
  
  
**Early Entry Applicants are responsible for completing their contract seat certification no later than November 1st prior to matriculation.**
## Bachelor’s Degree Options
Students in the EEP may choose any major of study; however, the following programs have degree requirements that mostly align with requirements for admission to the CVM and may offer the opportunity for students to earn both their bachelor’s and DVM degrees in a shortened period of time: 
  * Animal & Dairy Science 
  * Biochemistry 
  * Biological Engineering 
  * Biological Sciences 
  * Chemical Engineering 
  * Food Science Technology 
  * Poultry Science 
  * Wildlife Veterinary Medicine 


Please note there is no specific “Pre-Veterinary Medicine” major at MSU. However, students can opt for a pre-veterinary concentration.
## Course Requirements
All prerequisite courses must be completed by the end of the spring semester prior to matriculation and cannot be taken during a Maymester or summer term of matriculation year. Please note the academic year at MSU CVM for first-year students begins mid to late June. The courses that are listed below are examples of courses offered by MSU.
