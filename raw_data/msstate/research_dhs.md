## Maritime Domain Awareness Using Networked Unmanned Systems with Integrated High-Resolution Sensors
#### Overview
A key challenge for U.S. homeland security is achieving marine domain awareness of the nation’s vast maritime domain, which is roughly as large as the nation’s land area and extends from New England to Guam. To achieve maritime domain awareness (MDA) in the water and in the air across all these diverse regions, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) needs the ability to rapidly communicate, integrate, and analyze information that will facilitate effective and appropriate actions to protect people and property.  
  
This project seeks to develop, design, integrate, and analyze networked sensor technologies, or adapt commercially available networked sensors into both an unmanned maritime vehicle (UMV) and an aerial unmanned vehicle (UAV) to create a maritime domain Common Operational Picture (COP) that will enable the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) and its stakeholder partners to assess the ability to conduct more effective operations using integrated UMVs and UAVs as force multipliers in support of their statutory missions.
