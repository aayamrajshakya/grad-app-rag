## Comprehensive Exam
The Master’s Written Comprehensive Examination is a graduation requirement and is taken during the last semester of enrollment in the degree program. The Comprehensive Exam requires you to synthesize and apply your learning from courses in the program of study. In general, you should use the readings and professional resources from your courses to prepare for the exam as well as to respond to exam prompts.
You are not expected to do extensive outside research and reading to prepare for the exam; however, you may want to engage in additional reading/research if there are areas on the study guide with which you are unfamiliar. The exam consists of four areas, administered in two sessions of equal time.
Each four-hour session includes two prompts, which should be answered using an extended essay format. The exam is offered once each semester. The [CISE](http://www.cise.msstate.edu/graduate/) Graduate Handbook gives specific information about dates to register for and take the exam.
