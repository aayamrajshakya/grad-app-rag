##  Our Difference  
About the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine Program 
Our graduates are highly sought after and are offered opportunities to work all over the world in a variety of different capacities! 
The structure of our curriculum provides an extensive amount of hands-on, clinical experience, which is appealing to many employers. To prepare for clinical instruction, students in phase 1 follow a set curriculum for the first two years. MSU students receive core instruction in all major domestic species and do not "track." Phase 2 begins in the third year with required clinical rotations in the majority of our clinical service areas. The fourth year provides time (26 weeks) for students to focus on their career interest through their choice of externships and elective coursework.
