## Program Information
The Materials Certificate/Endorsement Program, administered through the Bagley College of Engineering, is available to qualified students who complete an organized plan of study in the interdisciplinary field of materials science and engineering at Mississippi State University.
The University’s various departments offer a range of materials-related courses in both the science and engineering fields, such as biomaterials, electronic and semiconductor materials, composites, polymers, metals, ceramics, and construction materials. We also have a wide range of supporting courses in the areas of materials modeling, mechanics, processing, and characterization, along with special topics in fatigue, fracture, and corrosion.
As part of an organized plan of study, including Directed Study courses under the direction of a [Materials Faculty Member](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/research/materials/ "Materials Faculty Member"), these courses allow students to pursue an interdisciplinary education and training program tailored to individual interests.
The Materials Certificate/Endorsement Program is available to both traditional and non-traditional students. This allows industry to offer employees further training in materials, as well as provide current university students the opportunity to pursue an interdisciplinary materials specialty.
## Requirements
To be admitted to the program, students must first successfully complete freshman chemistry (CH 1213, CH 1223), freshman calculus (MA 1713, MA 1723), and physics (PH 2213, PH 2223). If you would like to propose an exception to these courses, it must be discussed with the MWG faculty advisor who will handle each request on a case-by-case basis.
To receive the Materials Certificate/Endorsement, students must then complete four additional courses and a 3 hour Directed Study course under the direction of a faculty member of the [Materials Working Group](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/research/materials/ "Materials Working Group"). The four traditional courses should be chosen from the “Level” course list.
  * One Course from Level I
  * Two Courses from level II
  * One Course from Level III
  * Plus, One Course Directed Study


A grade of “C” or better must be attained in all four courses, including the Directed Study course. Only one course in Level II can be from the Special Topics category.
In all cases, it is the student’s responsibility to provide official transcripts of all courses taken prior to admission into the program.
