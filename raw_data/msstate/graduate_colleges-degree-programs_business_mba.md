The College of Business offers the general M.B.A. degree as well as the M.B.A. with a concentration in Project Management. Both of the programs are offered on the Starkville campus as well as online. The M.B.A. program prepares students for successful careers in the business world by providing
  1. in-depth knowledge of the business world including awareness of current business trends and challenges posed by the rapidly changing global economy and understanding of the ethical and social responsibilities of business;
  2. enhanced skills in speaking and writing effectively, analyzing data and synthesizing information, working effectively with individuals and teams, utilizing technologies to support and communicate decisions, and making and recognizing well-reasoned decisions;
  3. the ability to integrate acquired business knowledge in order to present and defend appropriate solutions to challenging business dilemmas and demonstrate effective leadership skills in a business setting.


## Admission
An applicant for the M.B.A. program should hold a bachelor’s degree from a fully recognized four-year institution of higher learning that enjoys unconditional accreditation by appropriate regional accrediting agencies. All general requirements stated in this publication must be met.
In addition, a student must submit a statement of purpose, transcripts, three letters of recommendation, and a current résumé. The College of Business does not allow unclassified graduate students to take courses. Students must be accepted to a degree program prior to registering for courses.
Applicants will not be permitted to take graduate-level MBA courses prior to official admission to the program. Applicants may choose to take undergraduate prerequisite courses prior to official admission into the MBA program; however, doing so in no way guarantees admission to the MBA program.
Our full-time, on-campus program accepts applications for the summer semester only
Our part-time, distance program accepts applications for fall, spring, and summer.
### International Applicants
An international applicant not holding a degree from a U.S. institution must submit an indicator of English proficiency including one of the following: a TOEFL score or an IELTS score, administered within the last two years.
## Transfer of Credit
Up to 6 hours of graduate transfer credits may be accepted toward fulfilling the requirements for the master’s degree, provided the credits have been earned in a recognized (regionally accredited) institution and are consider applicable to the student’s graduate program. These credits are considered part of the student’s program and must adhere to the eight-year time limit restriction. Grades of C or below are not acceptable, nor are extension credits from other institutions.
## Academic Performance
A grade of B or better is required on all undergraduate prerequisite courses. A student must also achieve a grade of B or better in MGT 8123. In addition, the MSU requirements for satisfactory progress in a graduate program will be applied; these requirements are found at [/graduate/academic-policies/academic-requirements/](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/academic-policies/academic-requirements/).
