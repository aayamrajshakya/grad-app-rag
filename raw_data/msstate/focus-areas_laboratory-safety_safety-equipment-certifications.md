#  Safety Equipment Certifications
EH&S either performs routine certification or stipulates certification via a professional service provider for critical safety equipment. Certification standards for emergency showers/eyewashes, fume hoods, and biological safety cabinets are detailed below.
## Emergency Showers/Eyewashes
EH&S performs annual certifications of emergency showers and eyewashes in accordance with the SOP linked below. Although EH&S checks emergency showers/eyewashes on a yearly basis, lab personnel should assess units on a monthly basis to ensure lines are flushed and there are no signs of leaking or damage. Please notify EH&S if an eyewash or safety shower does not meet the minimum requirements detailed in the SOP.

## Fume Hoods
EH&S performs annual certifications of fume hoods in accordance with the SOP linked below. Performance certification of fume hoods involves ensuring structural integrity, verifying alarm function and display monitor accuracy, and testing the air velocity to ensure proper functionality. A fume hood can be marked as “passing”, “marginal”, or “failing”; depending on the status, EH&S may require staff to discontinue work in the hood until noted issue(s) can be resolved.

## Biological Safety Cabinets
EH&S does not have the capacity to certify biological safety cabinets; however, all units that are used with infectious or potentially infectious materials must be annually certified in accordance with NSF/ANSI 49-2022: Biosafety Cabinets Design and Performance standards. In accordance with the standard, biosafety cabinets must also be recertified if moved or repaired. Service contracts may be maintained through EH&S or through individual/departmental affiliations. Please reach out to EH&S (ehs@msstate.edu) if you have any questions or concerns.
