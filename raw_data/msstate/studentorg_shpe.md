#  Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers – SHPE
### History
The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was established in 1974, and it quickly developed and spread out around the country. The Mississippi State chapter of SHPE began in the fall of 2008 when Tommy Stevenson, who was serving as assistant dean, introduced the organization to a group of Hispanic engineering students who were looking to establish a network for Hispanic engineering students on campus. After several informative meetings, the chapter was initiated.
Since then, the chapter has grown, to include 23 members from engineering, sciences and math departments. While the chapter is still fairly new, it has done a lot to make an assertion to the Hispanic community in Starkville. During the National Hispanic Heritage month in October 2009, the chapter hosted five events including a Latino soccer tournament, Spanish mass and a Latin American night, which turned out to be a huge success bringing over 350 people to campus. The chapter receives significant support from the Bagley College of Engineering and other colleges on campus. Each year, several members travel to the SHPE National Conference where students are able to participate in events such as seminars, workshops, lectures and a career fair.
### Mission
The purpose of the MSU SHPE student chapter is to encourage the Hispanic engineering community to initiate, develop and enhance the skills needed to further ensure the positions of Hispanics in technical degrees as well as the support to promote themselves.
  * Increase the number of Hispanic engineering students at Mississippi State University.
  * Promote the advancement of Hispanic engineers/students in their academics and in the networking of future employment opportunities.
  * Promote the advancement of Hispanic engineers and scientists in employment and education.
  * Develop and participate in programs with industry and the university, which benefit students seeking technical degrees.
  * Provide a forum or the exchange of information pertinent for Hispanic engineering/science students enrolled in Mississippi State University.
  * Provide information to Hispanic engineers/students of scholarships available from the National Society.
