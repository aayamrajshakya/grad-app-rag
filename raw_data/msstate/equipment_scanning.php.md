### Scanning Electron Microscope
SEM is an advanced imaging instrument that employs electron beams to visualize the surface morphology of specimens with high resolution. By scanning the specimen, SEM generates detailed images, revealing micro- and nano-scale structural features crucial for scientific analysis in fields such as materials science and biology. SEM can be high-resolution imaging, elemental composition, surface analysis, material characterization, and 3D Imaging.
