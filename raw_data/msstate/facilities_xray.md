### Single X-Ray Diffraction:
The X-ray facility in the Chemistry Department at Mississippi State University hosts a Bruker D8 Venture, providing a state-of-the-art platform for small and medium sized molecule analysis by X-ray diffraction. The system uses a dual wavelength configuration for small-molecule and protein crystallography. The dual microfocus source (copper/molybdenum) is equipped with a three-circle fixed Chi (54.7˚) sample stage goniometer, providing an open geometry and allowing for easy mounting of additional crystal-conditioning devices.
A motorized third generation Photon III – Mixed Mode X-ray Detection system is equipped. This detector offers mixed mode detection, simultaneously counting and integrating photon signals. This latest-generation detector provides high quality data for both strong and weak reflections. In addition, shutterless data collection is possible, which allows for full analysis in one hour or less for a well diffracting sample. Finally, the system is equipped with a Cryostream 800 (Oxford), the latest-generation liquid nitrogen cooling system. This feature allows variable temperature experiments over the range of 90 to 300 K.
Overall, this state-of-the-art multipurpose system is optimized for the analysis of small and medium sized organic and organometallic molecules. However, it can also be used for minerals and macromolecules.
#### List of some experiments and analyses can be performed:
  * Single X-ray diffraction analysis using Copper or Molybdenum X-ray radiation.
  * Fast crystalline phase identification using the Cambridge Data Bank; CCDC.
  * In-situ X-ray experiments under irradiation: UV.
  * Variable measurement temperatures in the range : 90 to 300 K, for phases transitions determination.
  * Characterization of enantiopure organic or organometallic molecules by absolute configuration determination.

### Powder X-Ray Diffraction:
A fully integrated powder diffraction system, the AXRD Benchtop from PROTO Manufacturing, is available for x-ray powder analysis. This system provides highly accurate and reliable measurement results comparable to the full-sized laboratory units. Capable of state-of-the-art high-speed data collection and equipped with a powerful hybrid photon-counting detector, the DECTRIS MYTHEN2.R.1D, allows the collection of low-resolution scans in few minutes, high-resolution scans in 15 minutes, and one hour for very-high resolution scans. Three scan modes are available:
  * Coupled θ/2θ; (Bragg Brentano configuration)
  * Decoupled θ/ θ for Rocking Curve
  * Decoupled θ/2θ for reflectivity studies, grazing incidence and thin films analysis


In addition, a six-position sample changer, an airtight sample holder for environment-sensitive samples and a variable temperature chamber for in situ temperature experiments can be used.
#### List of some experiments and analyses can be performed:
  * Crystalline phase identification and quantification.
  * Search/match against COD and ICDD databases: ICDD, PDF-4+ 2020 is available in the department.
  * Quantitative phases analysis.
  * Whole-pattern fitting (Lebail/Pawley and Rietweld refinement methods).
  * Determination of the ratio of crystalline to amorphous material in bulk materials and thin films.
  * Measurement of average crystallite size strain.
  * X-ray reflectivity: grazing incidence at low angle as low as 1˚ (surface studies and layers) and rocking curves (crystal defects study, mosaic spread, inhomogeneity, etc.).
