#  Architecture Summer Camp: Design Discovery 
Design Discovery is a seven-day summer workshop intended to answer many of the questions about architecture and design as fields of study and as professions.
### Next Camp: Summer 2026 (Dates TBA)
The major goal of Design Discovery is to simulate the information, skill and intensity required for an architectural education and to give clear insight into the practice of architecture. With this experience, it will be possible for the participants to make an informed career decision about architecture and its related disciplines.
* * *
## Eligibility
Admission into Design Discovery is open to rising high school sophomores through incoming college freshmen who are interested in the field of architecture and/or other related design fields. Older students are also encouraged to attend, but they must contact the school for specific instructions and arrangements before filling out the application. Neither school transcripts nor letters of recommendation are required. 
Prospective students, as well as those considering a career in architecture, have found Design Discovery helpful in confirming their choice of architecture as a profession and in making a smoother transition into the first-year architecture studio. The dedicated faculty members and high-caliber students who work as counselors and instructors during the week provide knowledge, experience, and friendships that will be valuable to entering architecture freshmen. The School of Architecture highly recommends all those who have been accepted into the first-year architecture studio consider participating in Design Discovery.

## Registration 
Design Discovery is first-come, first-served, and space is limited. All registration forms should be submitted by May 15. Anyone considering registering after this date should call the [Mississippi State University School of Architecture](https://www.caad.msstate.edu/academics/majors/architecture#contact-architecture) first to see if space is still available.
