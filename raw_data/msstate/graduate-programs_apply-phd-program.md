# Apply to PhD Program
To apply to any of our graduate programs please go to the graduate school’s [admissions website](https://apply.grad.msstate.edu/) and complete an application. You will select the program of study to which you are applying from among two options:
Doctor of Philosophy / Applied Psychology / Clinical Psychology   
Doctor of Philosophy / Applied Psychology / Cognitive Science
The application deadline for the Clinical Psychology program is December 1. The application deadline for the Cognitive Science program is December 1.
GRE test results are an OPTIONAL part of an application. Please see each program's webpages for their statements
We encourage potential applicants to consider submitting a draft of their personal statements to the Application Statement Feedback Program to get personalized feedback. This program is open to anyone applying to US-based psychology PhD programs, but is especially aimed at supporting applicants from underrepresented backgrounds, and/or who do not have access to mentors who can give feedback on psychology PhD application materials. Submission deadlines to get feedback are usually mid-October. Check out the ASFP website for more information: [https://www.asfp.io](https://www.asfp.io/).
Applicants are required to submit transcripts and three letters of recommendation. When completing the online application you will be required to provide the name and email addresses of your three recommenders. Please start your application well in advance to allow your recommenders sufficient time to submit their letters before the deadline. Information about application deadlines and admission criteria for the Clinical and Cognitive Doctoral Programs are available in the Graduate Catalog.
Information on Application Process to Note:  
When applying, please make sure you select enrollment for the FALL semester, not spring or summer. Additionally, please note, you can submit your application prior to all materials being submitted (e.g., letters of recommendation, official transcripts, etc.). You should submit the application as soon as you have completed your portion of the application.
