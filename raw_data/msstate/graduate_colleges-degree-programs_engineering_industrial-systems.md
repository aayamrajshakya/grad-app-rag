The Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering offers the Doctor of Philosophy in Industrial and Systems Engineering. In addition, the Department offers the Master of Science in Industrial and Systems Engineering with both thesis and non-thesis options.The M.S. (thesis option) is a research-oriented degree and serves to prepare students for positions in industry or government or for further graduate study in industrial and systems engineering or related areas.The M.S. (non-thesis option) is designed to prepare students for positions in business and industry that require a graduate education.
### Concentrations offered at the master’s level are:
#### Human Factors and Ergonomics Concentration (HFE)
This concentration is designed for students who wish to increase their understanding of Human Factors and Ergonomics (HFE). Students will be exposed to both a breadth and depth of HFE principles and practices including but not limited to physical ergonomics, cognitive ergonomics, and occupational safety and health.
#### Industrial Systems Concentration (SYS)
This concentration prepares students for general Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE) work. It is designed to allow the student a high degree of flexibility in selecting a program that meets his/her needs. For example, the student might choose to specialize in one or more areas of ISE (e.g., quality engineering) or choose a very broad program covering several ISE fields.
#### Management Systems Engineering Concentration (MGTS)
This concentration is designed for students who wish to increase their understanding and capability in the areas of management systems engineering and general engineering management. The philosophy behind this option is that students can be provided with knowledge that will enable them to apply an engineering approach to problems involved in the design and operation of management systems.
#### Manufacturing Systems Concentration (MFGS)
This concentration is designed for students who wish to increase their understanding of the design, analysis and control of manufacturing systems and processes.
#### Operations Research Concentration (OPRS)
This concentration is designed for students who wish to increase their understanding of and use of Operations Research (OR) skills for systems analysis and design.
#### Data Analytics (DAAS)
The Data Analytics (DAAS) concentration option is designed for students who wish to advance their careers in data analytics. The industry-relevant curriculum gives students the skills to extract valuable insights from big data. In this program, students will learn expertise in statistical modeling, data management, machine learning, data visualization, and data-driven decision-making related to industrial engineering applications, to meet the growing needs of industry, not-for-profits, government agencies, and other organizations.
### Accelerated Programs
Highly qualified undergraduates in the Bagley College of Engineering are encouraged to consider applying to one of two Accelerated Programs offered by the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering. 
Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering leading to Master of Science in Industrial Engineering
At the time a student applies to the program, the student must:
  1. be enrolled at Mississippi State University in one of the eight Bagley College of Engineering programs;
  2. have earned at least 60 hours toward their respective degree; and
  3. have an overall cumulative grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.50.


An application package consists of the following items which must be submitted to the Graduate Coordinator of the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department.
  1. Application form
  2. One-page résumé


Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering leading to Master of Business Administration-Project Management
A second Accelerated Program encourages undergraduate students in Industrial Engineering to work toward a Master of Business Administration-Project Management degree and permits them to earn up to 9 hours of graduate-level coursework during their undergraduate industrial engineering program. These 9 hours are taken as graduate-level courses and earn both undergraduate credit (toward B.S.I.E. completion) and graduate credit (toward M.B.A.-P.M. completion) simultaneously. The Accelerated Program allows students to complete three foundational courses in the M.B.A.-P.M.program while still pursuing their B.S.I.E. The courses approved for the Accelerated Program are IE 6333 (Production Control 1), IE 6533 (Project Management), and IE 6653 (Industrial Quality Control 1). Junior and senior industrial engineering students with a cumulative GPA of 3.50 or higher are eligible to apply. Students interested in applying to the B.S.I.E./M.B.A.-P.M. program should see [Accelerated Programs ](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/)and contact Dr. Lesley Strawderman, ISE Undergraduate Coordinator. Ms. Angelia Knight is Director of the MBA programs in the College of Business. 
Admission requirements include the following.
  * A GPA of 3.50/4.00 for all undergraduate work
  * A minimum of 60 hours towards the bachelor's degree
  * Completed application available from the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering
  * Résumé


## Admission Criteria
Typically, an entering M.S. student should have a grade point average of 3.00 out of 4.00 for the junior and senior years. Likewise, an entering Ph.D. student with an M.S. degree should have a 3.50 out of 4.00 grade point average on the M.S. work, while a Ph.D. student entering with only a B.S. degree is expected to have a 3.50 out of 4.00 on the last two years of the undergraduate program. A student with a lower GPA may still be eligible for admission based on outstanding qualifications in other areas. All entering students must submit GRE general-test scores. International students must have a minimum TOEFL score of 550 PBT (79 iBT) or IELTS score of 6.5.
The department reviews completed applications four times a year: February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15. Incomplete or not fully processed applications will be reviewed during the next cycle.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's Program of Study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
In addition to the criteria defined in the current Bulletin of the Graduate School, unsatisfactory performance in the graduate program in Industrial and Systems Engineering is defined as any of the following.
  * Failure to maintain a 3.00 average in the M.S. program or 3.30 in the Ph.D. program,
  * Failure of the qualifying exam (Ph.D. students only),
  * Failure of the preliminary exam (Ph.D. students only);
  * Failure of the comprehensive final exam (M.S. non-thesis option only),
  * Unsatisfactory evaluation of thesis or dissertation, or
  * A failure of the required component of the program of study. 


Any one of these will constitute the basis for review for possible dismissal. If the students drops six or more quality points below the required average (3.00 for M.S. or 3.30 for Ph.D.), the graduate coordinator will review the record along with the student’s graduate committee and will recommend a final course of action, which will be immediate dismissal or the establishment of a probationary period in which corrective action must take place.
While on probation, the student is not eligible to receive an assistantship and is required to raise his/her cumulative GPA to 3.00 for M.S. or 3.30 for Ph.D. by the end of the following semester of enrollment. During that semester, the student must enroll in 9 credit hours of coursework; Directed Individual Study courses are excluded.
In case of a dismissal from the graduate program, a student may appeal his/her academic dismissal according to the following procedure.
  * Within four weeks of being notified of the official dismissal, the student must present the request and related explanation in writing to the graduate coordinator. The graduate coordinator will review the appeal with the appropriate departmental committee and render a recommendation.
  * If the appeal at the departmental level is unsuccessful, a student may then appeal to the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in the college.
  * If the appeal at the college level is unsuccessful, the student may then appeal to the Office of the Provost.
