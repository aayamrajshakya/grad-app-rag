#  Interior Design Internships 
As a component of the curriculum, interior design students complete a three-month internship. The internship occurs in the summer following their third- or fourth-year in the program. 
These internship experiences immerse students into the profession of interior design, offering them opportunities to participate and contribute to national and international projects. This project participation and mentoring by design professionals prepares students to easily transition into permanent employment, resulting in Mississippi State University interior design graduates consistently being 100% employed.
