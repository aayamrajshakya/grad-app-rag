The field of communication is constantly transforming itself. You will want to graduate with the skills and connections that will land you an immediate job or a spot in a top graduate program. We're the place for you. At MSU we stress a hands-on approach to learning. This practical approach may come in the form of theatre set design, preparing a public relations strategy to covering a news story. Our faculty bring a blend of scholarly activity and creative professional work to the classroom. Students also learn from each other through their work in extra-curricular and co-curricular activities that complement formal instruction. 
MSU offers a variety of ways to be involved in student activities via Take 30 (Tv news), the Reflector (newspaper), Hail State Productions (University Television), WMSV (Radio), the DMC (Digital Media Center), PRISM (Public Relations Integrated Student Media) and a variety of annual theatrical productions. In addition, MSU hosts the Theta Alpha chapter of Lambda Pi Eta (LPH) - the official communication studies honor society of the National Communication Association, PRAM - a regional organization comprised of college students and the best public relations practitioners in Mississippi and the Public Relations Student Society of America (PRSSA) is the largest pre-professional organization for public relations students in the nation.
At the MSU Department of Communication, Media & Theatre, we're small enough to know you, big enough to challenge you and diverse enough to stretch you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding our department. Thank you again for your interest in MSU. We hope to see you soon!

Terry Likes, Ph.D.
