# Hunting Leases
  * Inventory you property to ensure you can offer a hunting lease
  * Determine the type of lease you will have
  * Take into consideration what hunters look for
  * Utilize a lawyer to draft your lease
  * Liability insurance is important


## Hunting Leases
An increasing number of hunters are seeking higher quality hunts in more relaxed environments. Private land often has these features and rural landowners around the country are finding that they can provide unique hunting opportunities on their land as a means of generating extra profits.
The income potential of fee-hunting businesses depends on location, landscape, local wildlife habitat, and the amenities provided. The fee-hunting business is diverse and landowners can offer a variety of services, from seasonal leases to full-service guided hunts. Proper habitat management and selective harvest of certain game species can enhance wildlife populations and increase hunter success. In addition to diverse wildlife, hunters are also looking to be surrounded by a beautiful, natural setting.
Landowners should approach the opportunity to open their land to fee-hunting carefully. Consulting with attorneys and insurance professionals to cover liability issues is important. Marketing services can be achieved through websites, newspaper and magazine advertisements, and most importantly, word of mouth.
