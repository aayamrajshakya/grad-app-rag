#  Lab Safety Reviews
EH&S conducts annual Lab Safety Reviews of all MS State research, academic, and diagnostic labs. These reviews aim to assess facility design, communicate critical safety guidance, and help ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
## Lab Safety Review Checklist
It is important to note that EH&S Lab Safety Reviews are graded. In order to provide an objective score, safety considerations are ranked via a risk assessment matrix that evaluates the likelihood of adverse outcomes versus the severity/impact of an event.

  * Severity/impact determinations are multifaceted, and key considerations include: 
    * Direct risk to the health and wellbeing of laboratory workers.
    * Indirect risk to the local community, including public safety and environmental health.
    * Risk of regulatory noncompliance that potentially disrupts standard operations, imparts fines, or promotes a negative public perception of the University.


  * Based upon the risk assessment, safety considerations are graded in accordance with the following criteria*: 
    * Major Risk ConsiderationsWorth 3 points
    * Moderate Risk ConsiderationsWorth 2 points
    * Minor Risk ConsiderationsWorth 1 point


* To help foster a robust culture of safety, EH&S strives to reduce year-after-year repeat issues. As such, points are doubled for any repeated deficiencies.
The comprehensive Lab Safety Review Checklist is intended to communicate key considerations that are evaluated during routine reviews. Pertinent considerations will vary depending upon the specific nature of the laboratory environment.

For assistance with identifying your particular lab classification, please review the MSU Lab Classifications Guide.

## Lab Safety Review Procedure
  * EH&S Specialists will request booking of a Lab Safety Review appointment with the responsible Principal Investigator, Laboratory Director, or responsible designee. Please see the [2025 Lab Safety Review Schedule](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-12/2025%20Lab%20Safety%20Review%20Anticipated%20Schedule.pdf "2025 Lab Safety Review Schedule") which outlines the anticipated review timetable. 
  * Prior to the appointment, it is imperative for Principal Investigators or appointed responsible designees to submit a current [Lab Personnel Roster](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-12/Lab%20Staff%20Personnel%20Roster.docx "Lab Personnel Roster") to disclose all individuals who work in a lab under their supervision. This roster needs to document all personnel who work in the lab including full-time staff (such as research scientists, postdoctoral associates, graduate students, etc.) as well as intermittent workers (such as undergraduate students).
  * Based upon the hazards present in the laboratory space, appropriate EH&S subject matter experts will complete the comprehensive Lab Safety Review. 
  * Upon completion of the review, reports will be issued detailing the findings, resolution guidance, and the Lab Safety Score.
  * Investigators or responsible designees will need to submit documentation indicating how the noted issues have been addressed within 45 calendar days of the review. If issues are not resolved within this timeframe, concerns may be escalated per University policy. For additional guidance regarding the issue resolution procedures, please refer to the linked [Corrective Action Workflow reference guide](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-12/Laboratory%20Safety%20Review%20Corrective%20Action%20Workflow%20Reference%20Guide_1.pdf "Corrective Action Procedures"). 
  * EH&S may coordinate a secondary review of any labs that do not achieve acclaimed lab safety ratings as detailed below.
  * In order to potentially increase safety ratings, labs may request an additional EH&S Lab Safety Review 3 months after the initial review. In order to request an additional Lab Safety Survey, please fill out the service request form linked below:
