## Safety Dawg of the Month:
### Dr. Olga Pechanova
Please join us in recognizing Dr. Olga Pechanova, a dedicated member of the Institute for Genomics, Biocomputing & Biotechnology (IGBB), as an MSU Safety Dawg! She was nominated by Dr. Daniel Peterson, who had this to say in support of her commendation:
“It is part of Olga's job to help keep the IGBB labs clean and safe, and she does her job with aplomb! She ensures that all IGBB employees are educated on safety issues; indeed, she hosts an IGBB safety discussion group that includes IGBB faculty, staff, and students. At these meetings, Olga leads discussions of safety policies, emergency action plans for the IGBB and Pace Building, and other safety issues of relevance. Dr. Pechanova also schedules EH&S Waste & Laboratory Safety training sessions for IGBB employees.
Ever since Olga has been the IGBB's Lab Manager, the EH&S safety reviews of the IGBB labs have been exceptional! It is a joy to read the annual safety review reports for the IGBB; they are a direct reflection of Olga's dedication to safety and regulatory compliance.
In summary, I can think of no one more deserving of the title of EH&S Safety Dawg than Dr. Pechanova, and I am proud to have her on the IGBB team!”
We extend our gratitude to Dr. Pechanova for her long-standing commitment to safety!
