# Research
High Voltage and Dielectrics research projects are led by the Research Director Dr. Park.
High voltage engineering forms the backbone of all electrical systems, ensuring reliable transmission of energy from production to consumption. The research team develops solutions that address conventional as well as emerging dielectric challenges with the goal of securing the dielectric integrity of power and energy systems.

## Partial Discharge
Partial discharge is one of the main culprits of accelerated dielectric material aging and device failure. With the development of WBG power electronics and the technological advancements that followed, partial discharge is becoming a significant challenge that poses enormous risk to the emerging technologies. Our team strives to create novel ideas and adopt creative solutions from other disciplines to cure the chronic dielectric disease.
## Lightning Tolerant Materials
The impact of lightning strike on aircraft, UAVs, and wind turbines causes significant structural damage. The damages are analyzed both computationally and experimentally. The results are used for designing new materials that could tolerate lightning impact more effectively.
## New Dielectric Media
Our group explore, analyze, and model the dielectric properties of new dielectric media. Models are developed to predict dielectric strength variations and high-voltage experiments are conducted to confirm the estimations. New dielectric media that we are studying include cryogenic fluids, sulfur hexafluoride alternatives, supercritical fluids, biopolymers, and super wood.
## Cryogenic Power Applications
Owing to the high-power-density and efficiency, cryogenic and superconducting technologies are strong candidates for future naval and aerospace power applications. Our team closely collaborates with the Plasma and Dielectrics Lab at Georgia Tech and Florida State University to characterize cryogenic power electronics and high-temperature superconducting materials.
