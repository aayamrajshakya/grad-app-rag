# Current Students
A good college education offers a student many opportunities for learning inside and outside the classroom. According to the National Study of Student Engagement, students who participate in collaborative learning activities outside the classroom are more successful in college and after graduation.
Getting involved in [student engineering organizations](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/studentorg/ "Student Engineering Organizations and Teams") offers students the opportunity to build a network of career contacts and lifelong friends, develop life skills, gain on-the-job experience, and acquire leadership and teamwork skills. By being a part of a close-knit community, student members have a network of faculty and administrators who encourage creative thinking and taking risks that lead to personal and professional growth.
