## Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) Certification Program and Workshop
**_Held semi-annually prior to the beginning Fall and Spring semesters_**
The Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) Workshop is designed for graduate students who have accepted a Graduate Teaching Assistantship at MSU.
  * Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) General Session (for all GTA Levels)
  * Classroom Certification (CC) Evaluation (for GTA2/GTA3 certification)


All graduate students who plan to serve as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) must participate in the Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) Certification Program prior to beginning the first teaching assignment at MSU. Students must satisfy all program/evaluation requirements necessary to obtain the level of certification (GTA1, GTA2, GTA3) corresponding to the duties/responsibilities of the teaching assistantship appointment. Once a student has received their required certification, they do not need to complete the workshop again for the same certification.
**GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANT (GTA) GENERAL SESSION**
Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) General Session provides students who are planning to become new teaching assistants with an introduction to effective teaching methods and tools and serves to educate TAs about University policies and resources. The General Session will be held asynchronously through a Canvas course and students will need to complete a quiz to receive their certification. The GTA Workshop emphasizes the importance of providing high-quality instruction at Mississippi State University.
**_All first-time GTAs are required to attend the GTA training. Failure to complete the GTA training will render a student ineligible for a teaching assistantship award._**
**CLASSROOM CERTIFICATION EVALUATION**
The Microteaching Simulation Classroom Certification Evaluation is the tool used to determine whether GTAs are equipped with the skills needed to deliver high-quality instruction to undergraduate students at Mississippi State University. Prospective students from GTA2/GTA3 certification prepare a 10-15 minute interactive mini-lesson that would be presented to students as part of an assigned course and deliver the mini-lesson to an evaluative panel of graduate faculty members. Classroom Certification is required of all teaching assistants whose responsibilities involve direct contact with students such as giving presentations in lectures or laboratories, conducting lectures, and leading discussion groups.
**_A student cannot participate in the Microteaching Simulation/Evaluation for Classroom Certification segment until all other Teaching Assistant Certification Program requirements have been completed._**
**Waivers to allow classroom laboratory teaching (GTA2/GTA3 levels) without successful completion of all Teaching Assistant Certification Program component requirements, Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA) Training, and Microteaching Simulation/Classroom Certification WILL NOT be issued.**
A Teaching Assistant who initially received assignment to a GTA1 level may later complete the evaluation for Classroom Certification in anticipation of a change in duties that require direct contact with students. A GTA who has already received assignment to a GTA1 level is not required to attend the General Workshop again. 
**SOCIAL AND RESOURCES FAIR**
The Graduate Student Social and Resources Fair is an optional event for all registered GTA Workshop participants, as well as all new graduate students. 
## Certification Levels for Graduate Teaching Assistants
By participating in the Graduate Teaching Assistant Workshop, graduate students can become certified at one of the following levels that correspond to the duties/responsibilities of the teaching assistantship appointment:
  * **Graduate Teaching Assistant 1 (GTA1):** Graduate students will assist in such tasks as preparing examinations, grading papers, preparation of class lectures, maintenance of class records, and tutoring students outside formal classes. Does not require the Classroom Certification. A GTA who initially received assignment to a GTA1 level appointment may later complete the Classroom Certification Evaluation in anticipation of a change in duties/responsibilities that require direct contact with students.
  * **Graduate Teaching Assistant 2 (GTA2):** Graduate student may have some of the same duties as GTA1. Other responsibilities include making presentation in laboratories/ classrooms, conducting lectures, and leading discussion groups. These tasks involve direct contact with students. These students are not instructors of record. Requires Classroom Certification Evaluation.
  * **Graduate Teaching Assistant 3 (GTA3):** Graduate student will teach for credit as the instructor of record and/or as the person primarily responsible for assigning grades. Mississippi State University Academic Operating Policy and Procedure (AOP) 13.09 Credentials for Teaching, states "Graduate teaching assistants may serve as instructors of record only for undergraduate courses. These graduate students must possess a masters in the teaching discipline, or at least 18 graduate semester hours (excluding seminar and research hours) in the teaching discipline and obtain classroom certification from the Graduate School. Graduate teaching assistants must receive direct supervision by a faculty member experienced in the same teaching discipline, regular in-service training, and planned periodic evaluations. Graduate teaching assistants cannot serve as instructors of record for graduate level courses regardless of qualifications." Requires Classroom Certification Evaluation. Additional paperwork may be required for verification of teaching credentials, including submission of transcripts from each institution attended.
