# Educational Specialists Degree Program in Counseling
## Overview
The Educational Specialist degree (Ed.S.) in School Counseling is a planned program of a minimum of thirty (30) semester hours above the master's degree under the direction of a major advisor and two committee members. Many students enrolled in Educational Specialist degree programs are seeking higher levels of certification or licensure. Students must have a master's degree (in any field) before applying for the educational specialist degree in school counseling.
Students who completed a master's degree from a non-CACREP program will be required to complete, from Mississippi State University, any course work that MSU students take as part of the CACREP approved master's program in counseling. These courses may be included in your Educational Specialist Degree Program of Study. Students from an academic discipline that was from a related field may be required to complete the equivalent of a master's degree as part of the Ed.S. program of study.
