# M.S. or Ph.D. Positions - Amphibian Reproductive Physiology
* * *
##### POSITION:
M.S. and Ph.D. positions in Amphibian Reproductive Physiology and Sustainable Collections Management within Zoos and Aquariums
The Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in collaboration with Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture at Mississippi State University (MSU), is seeking applications at the M.S. and PhD student rank.
##### LOCATION:
This position is on the MSU campus, located in Starkville, Mississippi. A description of the two departments can be found at <http://www.biochemistry.msstate.edu/> and <http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/wildlife>
##### STARTING REVIEW:
As soon as available or as negotiated. Review begins November 15; will continue until filled. Positions are available to start anytime during the Spring semester (Jan-May) with preference for a sooner start time.
##### RESPONSIBILITIES:
We seek students interested in specializing in reproductive physiology, endocrinology and sustainable collections research related to amphibians with particular emphasis on threatened and endangered species. The research will combine a mix of observational and experimental approaches focused on advancing assisted reproductive technologies and genetic resource banking
Additional responsibilities may include husbandry and care of the research animal collection; mentoring of interns and undergraduate students; providing assistance to senior scientists, research associates, and/or post-doctoral fellows in conducting investigations related to Zoo and Aquarium amphibian collections; compiling and maintaining complete and accurate research records through database entry, design and data management including statistical analysis; producing periodic progress reports and financial statements on the research program; interface with other staff members and Zoo professionals around the country; present research findings both nationally or internationally; perform other related duties as assigned to support the amphibian conservation lab’s mission in order to achieve the goals and objectives of the program. Our partners include the Fort Worth Zoo, Detroit Zoo, North Carolina Zoo and Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo and students accepted into the program will likely be required to travel between our partner institutions for a part of their research.
##### QUALIFICATIONS:
a B.S. degree in Biology, Animal Science, Wildlife/Fisheries, Biochemistry/Molecular Biology or similarly related field is required for the M.S. program, whereas a M.S. degree is required to enter the PhD program. M.S. applicants should have acquired internship or job experience that qualifies as having obtained working lab or amphibian familiarity. We are not accepting any straight-through Ph.D. applicants without already having obtained or about to obtain a M.S. degree already. Individuals with a DVM wishing to obtain a graduate degree in research are also encouraged to apply. Predominant qualification: a passion for amphibian conservation and interest in reproductive biotechnologies.
##### SALARY:
Annual $17,000 USD + tuition waived (>$11k) for MS
Annual $23,500 USD + tuition waived (>$11k) for PhD
##### APPLY:
Applications should be submitted electronically to Dr. Carrie Vance at the address below. Send unofficial college transcripts, curriculum vitae, and cover letter of intent with three potential references to contact:
