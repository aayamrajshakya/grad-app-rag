As an international student, you are permitted to work on-campus without any special authorization. Employment off-campus requires special authorization in the form of Curricular Practical Training (CPT) or Optional Practical Training (OPT). Please see the information below regarding employment.
## On Campus

  * Work is limited to 20 hours per week while school is in session or full-time during official school breaks.
  * Work required for an assistantship counts toward the 20 hour limit.
  * Work hours may not be averaged to equal 20 hours per week. For example, a student may not work 30 hours in one week and then 10 hours the next to average to 20.
  * Work must be considered on campus per the regulations. Questions about what is considered on-campus should be directed to the International Services Office.


## Curricular Practical Training (CPT)
Gain practical experience directly related to your field of study.
Curricular Practical Training is designed for F-1 students to gain practical experience directly related to their field of study. Students who wish to participate in an off-campus internship, co-op, or research experience (paid or unpaid) should apply for CPT.
Please keep in mind that CPT authorization is not guaranteed and students should not begin employment until they have received a new I-20 with the authorization listed.
Students must be enrolled full time for one academic year with a GPA in their Current Degree Program to be eligible for CPT.

## Optional Practical Training (OPT)

Optional practical training is designed to provide you with an opportunity to gain actual employment experience in your chosen profession for a maximum of one year. Its purpose is to complement your academic work. Optional practical training falls into two categories: (1) Pre-Completion OPT and (2) Post-Completion OPT. Pre-Completion OPT is only available if your employment does not otherwise qualify for Curricular Practical Training (CPT). Please see the CPT packet for eligibility information. Post-Completion OPT is available as full or part‐time employment after you have completed your course requirements but before you have finished your thesis or full‐time employment after you have completed your degree requirements.
