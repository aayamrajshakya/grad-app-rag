## An Interdisciplinary Program
The graduate-level Gerontology certificate is a multidisciplinary approach to provide students with current factual and theoretical data relating to aging. The program is available both to degree and non-degree graduate students. A certificate is awarded upon the completion of 9 hours of specified coursework, 6 hours of approved electives, and 3 hours of research or directed individual study. For those students earning the certification in conjunction with an advanced degree in such disciplines as sociology, psychology, counseling, etc., the program would also constitute a gerontology concentration within the respective discipline.
For further information, contact Dr. Carolyn Adams-Price
