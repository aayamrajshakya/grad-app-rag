##  Fleet Safety 
Mississippi State University possesses an extensive array of over 800 vehicles, encompassing cars, vans, trucks, transit buses, and utility vehicles. These facilitate the movement of individuals and goods both within and in the vicinity of the campus. Designated as the University's "fleet," these vehicles are managed by staff and students who adhere to rigorous safety protocols. Only authorized drivers are permitted to operate these university vehicles, solely for official university-related purposes.
