Graduate study offered in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences leads to the Master of Science in Plant and Soil Sciences degree with concentrations in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science and also to the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science. The Horticulture concentration within the Plant and Soil Sciences degrees also offers a minor in Floral Management. The department has an extensive research program which provides a diversity of problems for thesis and dissertation research under the supervision of experienced and highly trained scientists. The Department of Plant and Soil Sciences offers graduate programs in Plant Breeding and Genetics, Molecular Biology, Crop Modeling, Agronomy, Soil Science, Crop Physiology, Weed Science, Turfgrass Science, Remote Sensing, and Horticulture. A Precision Agriculture Certificate is also offered.
Graduate programs are designed to develop skills in research techniques in reference to the individual needs of each student. This program is developed and administered by a departmental committee within the student’s area of specialization and may include courses in mathematics and statistics, biology, chemistry, biochemistry, remote sensing, etc., as well as agronomic, horticultural, and weed science courses. Graduate assistantships are provided, subject to availability of funds. An undergraduate grade average of B or better is required to be eligible for an assistantship.

## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates are encouraged to apply to an Accelerated Program which permits enrollment in graduate courses in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science during the student's final year of undergraduate studies. For complete information, see [Accelerated Programs](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/). This option is only available for students who plan to pursue a thesis-based Master of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science.
In addition to the University requirements, the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences also requires the following information from applicants:
  1. Submission of a standard application for graduate studies in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences
  2. Three letters of recommendation from individuals familiar with the applicant’s academic performance
  3. Submission of scores from the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test prior to enrolling in graduate courses
  4. A statement of professional interests and goals from the applicant, including specification of one or more potential major professors


## Precision Agriculture Certificate

### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
### Leveling Courses
The Department of Plant and Soil sciences recognizes that many students who hold bachelor degrees from other educational areas may wish to study toward an advanced degree within the department. These students may come from areas with different requirements than those normally associated with Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science. To increase the possibility of success in attaining the advanced degree, the department requires all graduate students to have a fundamental understanding of soil and plant science. To this end, all graduate students must have had at least one course in soil science equivalent to Soils (PSS 3303), a plant science course covering basic plant physiology, college mathematics, college chemistry, and college-level biology. Graduate students who do not possess these courses upon acceptance will be required to complete these courses during the first or second semester of their attendance at Mississippi State University.
## General Department Completion Requirements
M.S
M.S. Non-Thesis
Ph.D
## Academic Performance
Students in the M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs must maintain a 3.00 GPA after admission to the program. No grade below C will be accepted for graduate credit. More than two grades of C or below not exceeding 8 credit hours constitute grounds for dismissal. Note: A C grade for a course that is retaken and in which the student earns a grade of B or higher will not be included in the 8 total hours. However, the original grade is included as part of the calculation of the GPA. At any time, the student will lose any departmental assistantship should his/her cumulative drop below a 3.00. Students with alternative sources of funding (scholarships, fellowships, etc.) must follow the rules and regulations of the funding source.
