# Professional Communication for Engineers
The Shackouls Technical Communication Program (TCP) began in 1999 to help prepare engineering undergraduates for the writing and speaking they will do throughout their careers. Primary thrusts of the program include GE 3513 Professional Communication for Engineers (required of all engineering undergraduates), communication-related workshops in engineering courses, and assistance with accreditation outcomes assessment in communication, ethics and teamwork.
## GE 3513 Professional Communication for Engineers
The Bagley College of Engineering’s TCP began with the development of its own junior/senior-level professional communication course, GE 3513. Initially developed and offered as pilot sections, GE 3513 has grown to become the required writing course for undergraduate engineers. Over 15 sections of the course are offered every fall and spring semester, and several 5-week sections are offered every summer. Additionally, a graduate-level version of the course, GE 6513 (Engineering Writing and Presenting), is offered every summer. The instructors for GE 3513 bring to their classes years of experience both in teaching college-level writing and in professional technical writing. Course activities, discussions and assignments involve strategies, scenarios and documents based on realistic academic and workplace situations.
Course Descriptions and Objectives
GE 3513 Professional Communication for Engineers provides science and engineering students with instruction and practice in the technical communication process. The course focuses on the basic steps of analysis, development and revision as students practice the communication skills they will use in the workplace
  * Identify the specific purpose, audience, and relevant context for their writing
  * Explain concepts and devices in their disciplines in a clear, well-organized, and precise way for a broad audience
  * Evaluate and design graphics and infographics that effectively illustrate technical concepts
  * Demonstrate effective oral presentation skills, including clear speaking, precise content, fluid transitions, and dynamic body language
  * Analyze the ethical implications of engineering decisions based on analyzing case studies


Additional areas of emphasis include examining the ethical use of AI in writing and effective collaboration. Class assignments involve job-application documents, technical descriptions, proposals, presentations, and collaborative research papers based on engineering ethics case studies.
## Writing Tutor Program
The Shackouls TCP Writing Tutor Program, located in McCain 202, began in 1999 to assist the entire Bagley College with writing and speaking endeavors. The program now involves two engineering undergraduates who work with students and faculty from all eight Bagley departments. To contact the tutors for writing help or further information, send an email to bcoewritingtutors@gmail.com.
