# Information Technology
The Office of the CIO and Information Technology Services (ITS) deliver a rich, robust, and capable information technology environment to all students, faculty, and staff in support of the learning, research, and service missions of the institution. An expansive wired and wireless campus network spans over two hundred academic and administrative buildings, all residence halls, and many outdoor areas. The network links hundreds of large-scale computer systems and servers with thousands of desktop, laptop, and mobile devices. Access to remote branches of the University, as well as the Mississippi Optical Network, Internet, and Internet 2, is provided through high-speed, wide-area connections from the campus network. ITS also provides a wide array of information resources and services to the University community. These resources include BullyMail, the student email system; Exchange, the faculty/staff email system; myState, the University’s Web portal; myState Mobile, MSU’s mobile app for iOS and Android devices; and myCourses, MSU's learning management system for online and distance learning. Open access computer labs in Griffis Hall, the Learning Center, and Mitchell Memorial Library are available to all students, while a number of departmental computer labs are available to students in specific disciplines. An H.323 network facilitates real-time, interactive video classes and video conferencing from the campus to sites throughout the state, the region, and the world. Additionally, ITS makes available a large and growing number of classrooms equipped with state-of-the-art instructional technology to facilitate and enhance classroom instruction. Finally, a number of software packages such as Autodesk, Camtasia, and Microsoft Office are available at no cost for installation and use on student, faculty, and staff personally-owned desktop and laptop computers. Details on the information technology environment and available services can be found at the [ITS website](http://www.its.msstate.edu/).
