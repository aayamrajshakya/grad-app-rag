## Fish Innovation Lab
The Fish Innovation Lab conducts applied research and capacity-building (extension) projects in developing nations to improve aquaculture and fisheries technologies, reduce and mitigate risks to these industries, and improve human outcomes from them. Countries with current Fish Innovation Lab projects include Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria, and Zambia. 
Because the Fish Innovation Lab is hosted by the Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine, veterinary students here have the unique opportunity to engage and learn about international development and food security by participating in its programs. Students could participate in Fish Innovation Lab projects in fish health and biosecurity. Depending on student interest, students could also participate in projects on improving feeds for fish, improving fish genetics, developing aquaculture technology, optimizing fish yields from harvesting oceans or freshwater, food safety, or improving human nutrition through fish.
## The MSU-FAO Partnership
Mississippi State University has developed a unique partnership with the FAO which will allow our students (undergraduate, graduate and/or professional) to more expediently apply for positions within the organization and obtain partial funding to support their activities. Participating students will gain valuable insight into global activities supporting the goal of alleviating hunger worldwide, while gaining experience in the development and maintenance of public-private partnerships. 
All students must apply to the FAO as a program volunteer at the organization’s website. Once the application is completed, the student may apply to the Mississippi State University International Institute for funding considerations. Veterinary students should contact the program liaison at the MSU College of Veterinary Medicine, Dr. Carla Huston (huston@cvm.msstate.edu), for additional requirements and in regard to funding opportunities through the College.
Please note: When applying, students should select their three preferred country locations and not expect to work solely in the FAO Headquarters in Rome, Italy. In addition, while students may indicate their preference for assignments, they may be assigned to any area in the fields of animal health, food safety, public health, and emergency response to support the mission of the organization.
