# Graduate Council
The Graduate Council is the executive committee of the Graduate Faculty and is responsible for the formulation of academic policy and programs related to graduate study at Mississippi State University. In addition, the Council may advise the Dean of the Graduate School on any matter they, or the Dean, feel is appropriate. The Chairperson of the Graduate Council is elected by and from the members of the Council. 
The Council consists of one elected member from each of the eight academic colleges offering graduate study (programs), a graduate student association representative, and one fewer in number (seven) appointed by the Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs, of which at least one must represent interdisciplinary programs. Not more than two appointed faculty members may be from the same college or school. To be eligible for membership on the Council, members must hold Graduate Faculty status. The term of office is three academic years. A vacancy on the Council is filled in the same manner in which the member vacating the position was selected. In addition to the faculty, the Council has one graduate student representative who is usually the president of the Graduate Student Association. S/he is a voting member, and the term of office is one academic year.
