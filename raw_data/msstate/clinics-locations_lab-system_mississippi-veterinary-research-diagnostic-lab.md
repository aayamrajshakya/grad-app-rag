#  Mississippi Veterinary Research and Diagnostic Lab (MVRDL)
## Pearl, MS
The Mississippi Veterinary Research and Diagnostic Laboratory has one mission: to protect the health of animals, humans and the state’s agricultural economy. 
The MVRDL, which is administratively housed within the MSU CVM Department of Pathobiology & Population Medicine but actually located in Pearl, provides surveillance and diagnostic services in support of practicing veterinarians, individual producers, pet owners and the livestock industry, as well as tests to satisfy state and federal regulations regarding animal health, transportation, and export.
The MVRDL focuses on all species except birds, which are handled by the Lab’s counterpart, the Poultry Research and Diagnostic Lab (PRDL) housed at the same location. The MVRDL provides services in anatomic pathology, clinical pathology, microbiology, molecular diagnostics, serology and virology. 
MVRDL is accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians and is a member of the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which is a partnership of federal and state laboratories governed by the US Department of Agriculture.
