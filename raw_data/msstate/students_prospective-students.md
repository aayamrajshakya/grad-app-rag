A wide range of opportunities exist for students who pursue a degree in political science and public administration at Mississippi State University. For those students who wish to advance their career through postgraduate study, the major offers excellent preparation for further education.
A high percentage of postgraduates study law and others pursue doctorates in the fields of public administration and political science. Many of our undergraduate majors gain employment directly after the baccalaureate degree, obtaining excellent positions in politics, federal and state government service, diplomacy, and executive and managerial positions in the liberal professions.
Many students enhance their chances of job placement by interning in Mississippi and Washington, D.C. Students also take part in programs that emphasize pre-law preparation and international affairs.
Our graduate programs focus on the field of public policy and administration. The Master of Public Policy and Administration (MPPA) prepares students for executive and managerial positions in state, municipal and national government. The MPPA program is accredited by the Network of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs and Administration. Graduates earn prized placements at the executive level in federal government.
Doctoral graduates occupy faculty and executive positions across the United States and abroad in universities and government, both teaching and researching. The Ph.D. program in public policy and administration prepares students for a career in academia or executive service.
