# Campuses
## Starkville Campus
The main campus of Mississippi State University adjoins the city of Starkville, 25 miles west of Columbus and 120 miles northeast of Jackson. Highways 82, 12, and 25 provide easy access to the University. Air service is available through the Golden Triangle Regional Airport located between Starkville and Columbus. The University has its own postal designation and zip code: Mississippi State, MS 39762. The Starkville zip code is 39759.
## Meridian Campus
Mississippi State University-Meridian is a regional, upper-division, degree-granting campus of Mississippi State University (MSU). Located in east-central Mississippi, the campus is non-residential and provides site-based credit and non-credit coursework. Courses are taught by highly qualified faculty, who are experts in their fields. Junior, senior, and graduate-level courses offered at MSU-Meridian enable students to fulfill all or some requirements for bachelor’s, master’s, specialist’s, and doctoral degrees. Students may also elect to enroll in specific classes for professional or personal growth.
A friendly atmosphere providing personal attention through small classes, a convenient location, and a diverse student population flavor the educational experience at MSU-Meridian. Through the flexibility of day and evening classes at the MSU-Meridian Campus, both non-traditional adult students and traditional college-age students are able to continue employment, maintain important roles in family life, contribute to their communities, and still obtain a quality Mississippi State University education.
MSU-Meridian serves as a proud representative of the University’s heritage as “The People’s University” and of its commitment of providing quality higher education through the mission of teaching, research, and service.
### Location
Mississippi State University-Meridian is comprised of two campuses. The College Park Campus is located on 26 acres at 1000 Highway 19 North in Meridian, a short drive northwest of Exit 150 off Interstates 20/59. The Riley Campus is located in the heart of Meridian’s downtown area, off 22ndth
### Teleclassrooms
Interactive “video conference classrooms” allow students on the Meridian and Starkville campuses to receive instruction and interact through two-way video and audio distance technologies. This greatly improves MSU-Meridian’s ability to expand the scope of its service and still maintain courses of the highest quality. The development of web-based (direct-to-desktop) delivery systems is also being utilized to facilitate the delivery of asynchronous and synchronous real time audio and video through computer-based technologies and the internet.
### Library Facilities
The MSU University Libraries, with the Phil Hardin Foundation Library on the College Park Campus and the Riley Campus, support the teaching, research, and service needs of the MSU-Meridian Campus community. Meridian Campus faculty, students, and staff have full access to all the electronic collections offered by the University Libraries, including scholarly journals, government documents, books, newspapers, and reference materials. Physical items located on the Starkville Campus are accessible through Interlibrary Loan and the Library Express document delivery service at no charge to the MSU-Meridian community. An “Electronic Library Room” is available so that individuals at MSU-Meridian may access these online resources and services, including online workshops and podcasts. 
### Students
Approximately one-half of the MSU-Meridian students reside in Lauderdale County. The remainder commute from Alabama and from 32 surrounding Mississippi counties, including Clarke, Jasper, Jones, Kemper, Leake, Neshoba, Newton, Scott, and Wayne.
