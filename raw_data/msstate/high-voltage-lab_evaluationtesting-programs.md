# Testing
In addition to academic research, manufacturers, utilities, consulting firms and agencies utilize the high voltage facilities for evaluation of new high voltage products, in-service equipment, materials, accessories and assemblies. Since its establishment, the Mississippi State University High Voltage Laboratory has catered to the needs of numerous manufacturers, utilities, consulting firms and agencies in evaluating new products, in-service high voltage equipment, assemblies, and materials. The High Voltage Laboratory provides independent third-party evaluations according to national and international standards and customer specifications.
