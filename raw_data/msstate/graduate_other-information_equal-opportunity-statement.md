# Equal Opportunity Statement
Mississippi State University is firmly committed to Equal Employment Opportunity, Affirmative Action, and compliance with all Federal, State, and local laws that prohibit employment discrimination. Discrimination based on race, color, ethnicity, sex (including pregnancy and gender identity), religion, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, genetic information, status as a U.S. veteran and or any other status protected by state or federal law is prohibited in all employment decisions including, but not limited to, recruitment, employment, training, promotion, compensation, benefits, disciplinary actions, and termination. All personnel actions are administered without regard to the above factors and are based only on valid job requirements. 
Mississippi State University will take affirmative action to recruit, employ, and advance minorities, women, qualified individuals with disabilities, disabled veterans, recently separated veterans, Armed Forces service medal veterans, and other protected veterans.
Employees of and applicants to Mississippi State University will not be subject to harassment, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination because they have engaged or may engage in any of the following activities: (1) filing a complaint; (2) assisting or participating in a review, investigation, compliance evaluation, hearing or any other activities related to the administration of Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 503), the provisions of the Vietnam Era Veterans' Readjustment Assistance Act or 1974 (VEVRAA), or any Federal, State, or local law regarding EEO for qualified individuals with disabilities or qualified protected veterans; (3) opposing any act or practice made unlawful by section 503, VEVRAA, or their implementing regulations or any other Federal, State, or local law requiring equal opportunity for qualified individuals with disabilities or qualified protected veterans; or (4) exercising any other right protected by section 503, VEVRAA or their implementing regulations.
Mississippi State University has developed a written Affirmative Action Program which includes an audit and reporting system. In order to ensure implementation of the University's Affirmative Action Program, Judy Spencer is designated as the EEO/AA Coordinator for Mississippi State University.
The Affirmative Action Program is available for inspection by any employee or applicant for employment upon request during office hours at the Office of Human Resources Management.
