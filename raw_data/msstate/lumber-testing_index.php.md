# Lumber Testing
Lumber tests are performed to determine the strength and breaking point of an individual piece of lumber. Wood products that are used in construction, furniture and other manufacturing industries are subject to testing under a series of different forces. Click on the links below to learn more about each testing method and to view demonstration videos.
