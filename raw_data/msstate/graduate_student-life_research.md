# Office of Technology Management
As a land-grant university, research is core to Mississippi State University's mission. The University is classified as a "RU/VH: Research Universities (very high research activity)", the highest research classification, in the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. The University is also considered a "Top 100" public research institution, according to the most recent data from the National Science Foundation. Research being a fundamental part of the University's culture significantly contributes to many graduate students' success.

As part of the University's strategic plan, [State of Excellence: 2012-1017](http://www.msstate.edu/web/excellence/), research priority areas have been identified for the University. These priorities are used in directing future investments such as new faculty hires, infrastructure development, and resource allocation. They are not to the exclusion of other important academic, research and service areas on our campus. They are broadly defined intentionally, and each should be viewed across many colleges and disciplines, with both basic and applied research. The University strives for an interdisciplinary approach to these research areas and includes research in its broad definition, to include all forms of scholarship and creative endeavors. For more detailed information about each of these research areas, please refer to the [Research Focus Areas](http://www.president.msstate.edu/downloads/focusareas.pdf)[ ](http://www.msstate.edu/web/excellence/focusareas.pdf/)section of the University strategic plan or the website of the University's [Office of Research and Economic Development](http://www.research.msstate.edu/) .
