# Computer Science
Computer Science is the study of principles, applications, and technologies of computing and computers. It involves the study of data and data structures and the algorithms to process these structures; of principles of computer architecture — both hardware and software; of problem-solving and design methodologies; of computer-related topics such as numerical analysis, operations research, and artificial intelligence; and of language design, structure, and translation technique. Computer Science provides a foundation of knowledge for students with career objectives in a wide range of computing and computer-related professions.
Computer Science graduates begin careers as computer programmers, system analysts, programmer/analysts, software engineers, system programmers, computer system engineers, and in a number of other computer-related jobs. Several double-major programs are also available. A minor in computer science is available to students with major programs of study in other fields at the University. The department also offers study leading to the Master of Science degree and Doctor of Philosophy Degree.
The Department of Computer Science is dedicated to maintaining quality programs in undergraduate teaching, graduate teaching, and research and to the fruitful interaction between teaching and research. In research, we wish to maintain our emphasis on applications (often pursued with colleagues from other disciplines), and upon the synergistic relationships between theory and applications in which the most meaningful advances often result. The department has identified five specific areas in which we shall seek national prominence: Artificial Intelligence, Computer Security and Forensics, High Performance Computing, Software Engineering, and Visualization and Computer Graphics.

## [M.S. in Computer Science](http://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/ms-cs/)
  * Thesis option
  * Project option
  * Courses-only option


## [Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program](http://www.cse.msstate.edu/undergrad/accelerated/ "Accelerated B.S./M.S. Program")
  * A typical student could complete a B.S. in Computer Science or in Software Engineering and a M.S. in Computer Science in four academic years plus one calendar year. This will be accomplished by counting a maximum of nine credits of graduate courses toward both degrees.


## [Ph.D. in Computer Science](http://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/phd-cs/)
  * A Direct Ph.D. program is also available.
