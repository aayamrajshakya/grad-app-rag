### Financial Aid
Student financial aid is economic assistance to help you finance your college education. This assistance is awarded to help pay your educational expenses. This help can be in the form of scholarships, grants, loans, part-time employment or waivers. Eligibility for most of these programs is based upon the "demonstrated financial need" of the student applicant and the applicant's family.
