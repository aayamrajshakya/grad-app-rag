### MS STATE DEPARTMENT OF CHEMISTRY SAFETY PROTOCOLS – Reminders
#### Safety First …always...and last
Safety starts with good practices…
  * _WIDSIO – When In Doubt Shout It Out!!!_
  * An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure!
  * Prevent incidents by being prepared and knowledgeable
  * Follow your group’s standard operating procedures - SOPs
  * Discuss deviations from SOPs with lab mates and PIs
  * Openly communicate with peers and PIs any concerns
  * USE PPE – glasses, gloves, coats…
  * Check the SDS
  * Know the location of the safety equipment in your lab


But if something does go wrong…
  * If there is a fire, pull the fire alarm.
  * If there is a fire, if appropriate, use the fire extinguisher, then pull the fire alarm, dial 911, and/or call UPD (662-325-2121)
  * If there is a major solvent spill, confine the area (close doors), evacuate the area, and notify the front office.
  * If someone is injured, seek medical attention. Longest Health Center is across the street.
  * If someone is unconscious call 911, then try to administer first aid. Direct emergency responders when they arrive.


In all cases, when something goes wrong (fire, spill, injury, etc.) a report must be submitted to your PI and the faculty chair of the DSC**safety@chemistry.msstate.edu**. In this way, the DSC can continually assess the safety needs of the department and enact necessary changes to keep the researchers safe and productive.
