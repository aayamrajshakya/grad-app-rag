# Master of Physician Assistant Studies
Program Director: Shey Washburn  
MSU-Meridian Riley Campus  
2214 5th Street  
Meridian, MS 39301  
Telephone: 601-696-2320  
Fax: 601-696-2350

Website: [https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/physician-assistant/](https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/physician-assistant/)
Mississippi State University-Meridian initiated the development of the Master of Physician Assistant Studies Program after several years of needs assessment and after community support was determined to be strong. Located on the Meridian Campus, the program has access to several highly esteemed Mississippi medical systems. In 2017 The Board of Trustees of Institutions of Higher Learning designated MSU-Meridian as the home of the first state-supported Master of Physician Assistant Studies Program in Mississippi.
### Mission
The Mississippi State University-Meridian Master of Physician Assistant Studies Program will educate highly qualified, competent, healthcare providers who will increase access to care and provide primary care services to the diverse citizens of Mississippi.
### Preparation
Students seeking a career as a Physician Assistant (PA) should acquire a sound foundation in the biological sciences and knowledge of the behavioral and social sciences in high school and college. Because of the increasing use of information technology in medicine, students are strongly encouraged to acquire familiarity with computers. They must have a demonstrated aptitude for scientific study, and, in addition, hands-on experience in healthcare. An awareness of the requirements and characteristics of the practice of medicine as a PA is desirable in reaching a mature decision to pursue a career as a PA.
### Accreditation
Mississippi State University-Meridian has applied for Accreditation - Provisional from the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). MSU-Meridian anticipates matriculating its first class in January 2020, pending achievement of Accreditation - Provisional status at the September 2019 ARC-PA meeting.
Accreditation - Provisional is an accreditation status granted when the plans and resource allocation, if fully implemented as planned, of a proposed program that has not yet enrolled students appear to demonstrate the program's ability to meet the ARC-PA Standards or when a program holding Accreditation - Provisional status appears to demonstrate continued progress in complying with the Standards as it prepares for the graduation of the first class (cohort) of students.
The program will not commence in the event Accreditation - Provisional is not granted. For more information on the developing Master of Physician Assistant Studies Program, please see the program website at [https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/physician-assistant/](https://www.meridian.msstate.edu/academics/physician-assistant/) or contact PA@meridian.msstate.edu.
The program anticipates matriculating its first class in January 2020. Applications are accepted through CASPA, the online Centralized Application Service for Physician Assistant programs at [https://caspa.liaisoncas.com/applicant-ux/#/login](https://caspa.liaisoncas.com/applicant-ux/#/login).
