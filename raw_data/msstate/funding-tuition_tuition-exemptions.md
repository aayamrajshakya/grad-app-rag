The student must be a legal resident of that state and approved for a specific major at MSU. Both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible to apply. A qualified student must maintain full time status.

To be eligible for the non-resident waiver during the first semester of enrollment, applications and resident verification must be submitted to and approved by the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs prior to the first day of class.
