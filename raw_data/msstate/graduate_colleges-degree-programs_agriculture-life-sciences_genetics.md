## An Interdisciplinary Curriculum
An opportunity is offered to the student who wishes to work toward a degree in Genetics. MSU offers a Master of Science degree in Agricultural Life Sciences with a concentration in Genetics and a Doctor of Philosophy in Life Sciences with a concentration in Genetics. The Genetics program is an interdisciplinary curriculum which utilizes the staff and facilities available in the various departments and colleges. A wide array of plant and animal material is available for genetic investigation. The student’s complete program will be formulated in the department of his/her choice. Courses contributing to the major in genetics are listed below.
## Admission
Minimum required TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 500 PBT (61 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 5.5. A written cooperative agreement with a major advisor prior to admission is essential.

An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement.

With the approval of the graduate coordinator and the college dean, a student may retake one course per degree except for those approved for repeated credit (e.g. internships, special topics, individual studies, thesis, dissertation, etc.). Both courses will remain on the permanent transcript and both grades will be computed in final averages. This policy applies to all courses (even those not on the program of study) taken as a graduate student related to a specific program. Repeated courses must be taken at Mississippi State University. No additional program credit hours will be generated from a repeated course.
### Prerequisite
Individuals with a Bachelor of Science in the biological or physical sciences will be considered.
The students planning a major or minor in genetics should select the GNS prefix for each course when applicable.
