# Fellows & Affiliates
Faculty members located in academic departments/centers can be formally associated with the IGBB in two different ways:
## 1. IGBB Fellows
Through its Fellows Program
  

## 2. IGBB Faculty Affiliates
An IGBB Faculty Affiliate is any faculty member in an MS State academic department who (1) conducts research in the molecular biosciences and/or computational biology and (2) collaborates in some manner with IGBB faculty/staff. Like IGBB Fellows, IGBB Faculty Affiliates are encouraged to submit proposals through the IGBB, but are not obligated to do so. IGBB Faculty Affiliates generally do not have HPC² supercomputer access unless they are working on an IGBB research project. Faculty Affiliates can request access to the HPC² supercomputers if they are interested in generating data/results for an eventual proposal submission through the IGBB. Any IGBB Faculty Affiliate that submits and receives an external grant (with overhead) through the IGBB will be eligible for the IGBB Fellows Program.

ABSTRACT  
The COP9 signalosome (CSN) is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that resembles the lid subcomplex of proteasomes. Through its ability to regulate specific proteasome-mediated protein degradation events, CSN controls multiple aspects of development. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of AtCSN2, the last uncharacterized CSN subunit from Arabidopsis. We show that the AtCSN2 gene corresponds to the previously identified FUS12 locus and that AtCSN2 copurifies with CSN, confirming that AtCSN2 is an integral component of CSN. AtCSN2 is not only able to interact with the SCF(TIR1) subunit AtCUL1, which is partially responsible for the regulatory interaction between CSN and SCF(TIR1), but also interacts with AtCUL3, suggesting that CSN is able to regulate the activity of other cullin-based E3 ligases through conserved interactions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the duplication and subsequent divergence events that led to the genes that encode CSN and lid subunits occurred before the divergence of unicellular and multicellular eukaryotic organisms and that the CSN subunits were more conserved than the lid subunits during evolution. Comparative analyses of the subunit interaction of CSN revealed a set of conserved subunit contacts and resulted in a model of CSN subunit topology, some aspects of which were substantiated by in vivo cross-link tests.
