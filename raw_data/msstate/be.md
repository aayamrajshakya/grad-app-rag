# Biosystems Engineering
Our Biosystems Engineering (BSE) program (formerly biological engineering) helps students prepare for careers in which they apply engineering principles to biological systems. We have a solid base of traditional engineering courses mixed with exposure in chemistry/biochemistry and the biological sciences.
