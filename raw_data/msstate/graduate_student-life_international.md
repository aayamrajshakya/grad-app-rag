The International Institute at Mississippi State University fully integrates our land-grant institution's 130-plus years of leadership, teaching, research, and service into the global area. Founded in June 2011, the Institute serves as the guide and champion of the University's international education, global engagement, and development activities. The Institute's mission enriches and expands the academic, research and cultural experiences of faculty, students, staff, and community through global outreach, research, and academic programs. The International Institute houses the English Language Institute, International Communications and Protocol, International Recruitment and Retention, International Services Office, International Research Development, and the Office of Study Abroad. These units within the Institute cover a broad range of international services to support and promote globalization internally on campus and through external outreach.
## International Services
International Services, a unit of the International Institute within the Division of Academic Affairs, advises and provides information to students, research scholars, visiting professors, and MSU faculty and administrators about rules and regulations of immigration. International Services serves as the University liaison between the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the U.S. Department of State, and the Mississippi State University international community holding F and J visas. By administering both the F-1 Student and J-1 Exchange Visitor Programs, International Services provides documents for qualified non-immigrants to enter the United States. International advisors inform students about maintenance of lawful status, work authorization, enrollment requirements, extension of stay, and other immigration issues. Semi-annual orientation programs for new students along with additional immigration workshops are conducted by this office as well as annual international student services including orientation sessions, utility shuttles during holiday breaks, and offering an international tax software program.
The International Services office is located in 116 Allen Hall and can be contacted by telephone at 662-325-8929. Additional information can be found at the [International Services website](http://www.international.msstate.edu/current/services/index.php/).
