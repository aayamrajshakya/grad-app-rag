## Math Club
If you like solving challenging problems, working puzzles, playing games, showing off your math skills at competitions, or just like to meet other students who enjoy all these things as much as you, then Math Club is for you. Math Club is an organization for undergraduate students at Mississippi State University. Math Club meets every week during the Fall and Spring semesters. Our students compete in two competitions a year. At the end of the Fall semester, our students compete in the Putnam exam. You can find out more about the Putnam exam at the [Mathematical Association of America](https://www.maa.org/). During the Spring semester, our students travel to the Mathematical Association of America Louisiana-Mississippi Sectional Meeting with a faculty sponsor to compete in the Integration Bee and/or the Student Team Competition. Mississippi State University teams have consistently placed in the top 3 in the Team Competition and our students always report having a great time.
