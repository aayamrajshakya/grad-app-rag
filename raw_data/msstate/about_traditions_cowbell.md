# Cowbell
The cowbell is the longstanding visual and auditory symbol of Mississippi State pride. Legend has it a wandering Jersey cow became a good luck charm in the mid-20th century after having strolled onto the field during an ultimately victorious home football game. Over time, students began bringing cowbells for continued luck at outdoor athletic events and, in the process, began a tradition that continues in the modern era.
