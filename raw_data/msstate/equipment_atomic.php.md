### Atomic Force Microscope
An atomic force microscope is a type of high-resolution scanning probe microscope that has a resolution that you can measure in fractions of a nanometer. It operates using a sharp tip to scan extremely close to the surface of the sample and measures the interactions between the tip and surface. Advantages of the AFM include high resolution, versatility (can be used in air, liquid, or vacuum environments), and surface characterization. There are contact and non-contact modes of operation that depend on whether the cantilever vibrates when operating. Furthermore, there is also a tapping mode.
