## International Student Graduation Brunch
The International Services Office hosts an international student graduation brunch prior to the fall and spring commencement ceremonies. This event is a great opportunity for international students to be recognized for their many achievements, take professional photos with their friends, and celebrate their experiences at MSU. 
International students with a graduation application on file through the Registrar's Office will receive communication about the event approximately two months before commencement. All communication will be sent to the student's MSU Outlook email account.
