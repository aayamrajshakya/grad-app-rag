#  Standard Operating Procedures
A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a set of written instructions that outlines the steps for performing a process safely. All processes involving hazardous materials (biological, chemical, radioactive) or physical hazards require SOPs. For an SOP to be effective, all personnel must have documented training on applicable SOPs provided by the Principal Investigator or other experienced personnel. SOPs should be reviewed at least annually and updated when necessary.
## Key SOP Considerations
### What They Include
SOPs should include details on how to perform the process, potential hazards, and how to mitigate them. For example, if the process involves hazardous chemicals, an SOP should include information on the amount and concentration of the chemicals to use, how to obtain the working solution, and what engineering controls to use as well as personal protective equipment to wear.
### Who Writes Them
SOPs should be written by the laboratory personnel who are most knowledgeable about the process and authorized by the Principal Investigator / Area Supervisor.
### How to Make Them Clear
SOPs should be written in plain language so that anyone with a basic understanding of the process can follow them.
SOPs are important for ensuring that experiments are performed safely and consistently. This helps to reduce opportunities for incidental error as minimizes variability in conducting research. 
### Who Needs to be Trained
All new employees and students should receive hands-on training on the procedures covered by the SOPs.
### How Often Should They be Reviewed
SOPs should be reviewed at least once a year and updated when necessary.
## SOP Templates
EH&S created SOP templates that encompass fundamental considerations. Conformance to these SOP templates is recommended, but not required, so long as all the necessary information is readily conveyed.
