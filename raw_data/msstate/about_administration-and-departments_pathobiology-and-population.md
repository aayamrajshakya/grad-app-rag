#  Department of Pathobiology and Population Medicine (PPM)
The Department is diverse in function, specialty and geographic location, but the foundational role is diagnostic and clinical service. Our faculty provide diagnostic and animal health assistance for the state’s poultry, livestock and companion animals through their work in the Mississippi Veterinary Research Diagnostic Laboratory (MVRDL) System with a location on our main campus in the Wise Center serving the College and its Animal Health Center and the main location in Pearl, MS.
PPM faculty also staff the catfish diagnostic laboratory, located at the Thad Cochran Warmwater Aquaculture Center in Stoneville, MS, and support the state’s catfish industry with diagnostic service, on-farm consultation and catfish disease research.
Mississippi food animal industries receive assistance with animal health problems through our intensive in-hospital patient care, as well as on-farm, real world animal care. We have faculty who specialize in reproductive problems in animals, and they make extensive use of the Morgan Freeman Equine Reproduction Research Unit to improve knowledge of equine reproductive disorders.
