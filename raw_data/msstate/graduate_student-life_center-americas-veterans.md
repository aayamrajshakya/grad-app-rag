# Veterans Services
The G.V. "​Sonny" Montgomery Center for America's Veterans works to develop and implement a variety of programs to provide student support services focused on the special needs of today’s military veterans, service members, dependents, and survivors. The Center offers a comprehensive educational benefits counseling program to help students maximize VA educational benefits. The Center also provides assistance with Active Duty/National Guard/Reserve tuition assistance. The Center offers a variety of programs to facilitate the transition to school and to help ensure campus policies to better serve veterans, service members, dependents, and survivors. The Center for America’s Veterans also offers Veteran Work Study positions and a graduate assistantship. Mississippi State University now offers priority registration for eligible veterans, service members, dependents, and survivors. Nusz Hall is located at 250 Bailey Howell Drive (across from the Sanderson Center) and provides a veteran and military-dependent friendly atmosphere as well as a computer lab, individual study rooms, lounge with kitchenette, multi-purpose room and office space for the Student Veteran Association (SVA). Complimentary services for veterans and dependents include free printing, copying, scanning, and faxing.
