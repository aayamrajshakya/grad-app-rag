# Floral Management
Floral Management involves sourcing, purchasing, distributing, marketing, designing with, and selling floricultural products. Students enrolled in this concentration are provided with courses in design and horticulture, balanced with business and sciences. Career opportunities for graduates include retailing, wholesaling, special event designing, and display gardening. The University Florist, a professional flower shop owned and operated by the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences on the MSU Campus, provides students with work and management opportunities. The floral management curriculum is in the Horticulture major. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/floral-designers.htm): Most floral designers work in retail businesses, usually flower shops and grocery stores. The median annual wage for floral designers was $29,140 in May 2020.
