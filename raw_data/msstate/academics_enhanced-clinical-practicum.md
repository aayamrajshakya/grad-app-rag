#  Enhanced Clinical Practicum
Third- and fourth-year students participate in two four-week core clinical practice experiences. These rotations provide invaluable opportunities to develop clinical skills in real-world settings while enhancing your abilities in client communication and business management.
We believe that nothing compares to hands-on experience in the field. This program not only prepares graduates for the realities of veterinary practice but also helps reduce stress and anxiety for new professionals.
The ECP has enabled us to expand our professional program without overwhelming our faculty and facilities. Currently, 70 practices are enrolled, reaching 17 different states.
Participating clinics must meet specific criteria ensuring a safe and effective learning environment. Students are matched with practices that align with their educational goals and interests, evaluated on professionalism, knowledge, and clinical skills.
