E-mail: ms4004@msstate.edu
Graduate Study is offered in the Department of English leading to the Master of Arts degree. Teaching assistantships are available.
## Admission Criteria
Prerequisites for admission into the graduate program include all the general requirements of The Graduate School and an undergraduate English degree (or 18 hours of undergraduate English courses beyond composition, with a B average or higher). Applicants are strongly encouraged to submit GRE scores. International students must obtain a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 625 PBT (106 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 8 or better. An applicant must submit all materials by March 15 to be considered for an assistantship.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While on provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) Certificate Program
The Certificate in the Teaching of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) is designed to provide students with the theoretical and practical knowledge needed to begin a career in English language teaching. Students who earn the certificate will be prepared to teach English as a foreign language in countries outside the United States and English as a second language in positions inside the United States that do not require a teacher’s license. The TESOL certificate alone does not lead to a K-12 teaching license, which is required to teach in the public school system of the United States, but it can be added as an ESL supplemental endorsement to an existing or in-progress teaching license.
### Admission to the Certificate Program
The graduate program of the Certificate in TESOL is open to graduate students in good standing who are currently enrolled at the University in any major. The graduate-level certificate program is also open to non-degree seeking students who have completed a Bachelor's degree in any major. Degree-seeking students will be awarded their certificates at the time that they complete their degrees.
Additionally, the program is open to members of the following groups who hold a B.A./B.S. or higher degree:
  * Current employees of Mississippi State University
  * People currently employed as educators in Mississippi at any level
  * People who have earned a degree at MSU within the previous five years


## Unsatisfactory Performance
Unsatisfactory performance in the graduate program in English may be defined as any of the following: failure to maintain a "B" average in attempted graduate courses after admission to the program, a grade of U or F in any one course, failure of the comprehensive examination, unsatisfactory evaluation of a thesis, or failure of a required component of the program of study. Any one of these or a combination of these may constitute the basis for review for possible dismissal. The graduate coordinator will review the record along with the student’s graduate committee and take a final course of action which will be immediate dismissal or the establishment of a probationary period in which corrective action must take place. Appeal of dismissal can be made by submitting a written appeal statement to the department head. If the dismissal is upheld by the department head upon the student’s appeal, the student can then submit a written appeal to the dean of the College of Arts & Sciences.
## Programs of Study
Students may pursue an emphasis in Creative Writing or a minor in Teaching of English as a Second Language. External minors are also available.
