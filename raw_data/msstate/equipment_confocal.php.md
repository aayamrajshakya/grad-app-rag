### Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope
Axiovert 200 M Inverted Research Microscope  
  
Confocal laser scanning microscopy is an advanced optical imaging tool used to obtain high-resolution, three-dimensional images of biological specimens and other materials. The primary feature of the confocal microscope is the ability to eliminate out-of-focus light which results in improved image clarity and contrast that traditional microscopes cannot achieve. Benefits of confocal microscopy include improved resolution, three-dimensional imaging, and reduced photobleaching.
