Welcome to MSU and the Department of Political Science and Public Administration. We are happy to have you join the approximately 250 undergraduate students who are majoring in political science. The department has 18 faculty members, who are well-known for excellent teaching (several have won awards), significant research and active publishing. We also pride ourselves on being open and accessible to our students.
Courses in political science help students learn to think analytically and critically and to communicate effectively. Political science majors are pleased to find many of their classes are relatively small, with most enrolling fewer than 30 students. They also discover that political science offers three different honors courses every year. Small classes facilitate intense but friendly student-faculty interaction. Thus, political science majors are challenged to engage in some serious self-examination, and writing and reasoning skills are put to the test.
The Department of Political Science and Public Administration offers a Bachelor of Arts degree (B.A.) for individuals who have an interest in politics and who seek careers in the law, in federal, state, or local government (either administrative or elective), in the diplomatic service, with international organizations, in the business world, or in teaching.
##  Program of Study and Completion Requirements   

Students pursuing the B.A. degree in Political Science are required to complete PS 1113 and choose three of the following: PS 1313, PS 1513, PS 2403, PS 2703, or PS 2713. Students must also complete PS 4464 in their junior or senior year. They must also complete a minimum of seven upper-division elective courses in Political Science (totaling at least 21 credits); of these seven courses, at least one must be completed in each of three of the four subfields of the discipline as displayed in the “Part III: Description of Courses” portion of this Bulletin (American Politics, International Politics, Political Theory, and Comparative Politics).
Political science majors who wish to teach social studies in Mississippi may become certified by combining the political science major with appropriate courses in the College of Education; in Mississippi, it is not necessary to major in secondary education in order to become certified to teach. At the same time, majors in secondary education who plan to become social science teachers should consider a second major, or a minor in political science. Students not majoring in political science may wish to select a minor. A minor consists of a minimum of 18 hours of course work in political science at least nine of which must be at the 3000 level or above. Interested non PS majors should speak with the undergraduate coordinator to formulate a suitable program of study.
