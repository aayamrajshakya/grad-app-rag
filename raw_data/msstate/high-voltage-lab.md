The Paul B. Jacob High Voltage Laboratory at [Mississippi State University](https://www.msstate.edu/) serves as an independent, non-industrial, university center for high voltage engineering. The laboratory focuses on high voltage research, evaluation, and education. This multi-purpose high voltage facility is designed to meet the evaluation needs of the industry and provides the necessary environment for academic research in high voltage engineering. As an integral part of our national high voltage technology structure, the laboratory serves as a means of strengthening the U.S. position in this specialized technical area.
The lab was constructed in 1977 and is the largest university-operated high voltage facility in North America, enabling full-scale evaluation of large equipment with impulses up to 3,000 kV and 1,000 kV AC-voltage. The main laboratory hall has a floor area of 33.5 x 24.5 m and a minimum ceiling height of 15.2 m. The main laboratory is equipped with a 5-ton crane, full-scale wet test rack, faraday cage, and grounding mesh. As an independent laboratory, test results are held in the strictest confidence
