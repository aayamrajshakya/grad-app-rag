Program   

Accelerated nursing programs are different.
The MSU-Meridian accelerated Master of Science in Nursing program offers a pathway into practice as a Registered Nurse for those with a previous degree in a non-nursing field.
We leverage the skills, knowledge, and life experiences that each student brings as a scaffold for nursing practice. We strive to create a community where every student belongs, questions are welcome, and learning is active.
Students complete 58-semester credit hours of coursework over 12-months. Upon program completion, graduates are eligible for the NCLEX-RN examination and licensure as a Registered Nurse.
Classes are in-person with a focus on practice readiness and clinical judgment. Students apply classroom learning early and often, beginning supervised patient care within the first few weeks of the program.
Located in downtown Meridian, Mississippi in the historic Deen Building, the program has access to several highly esteemed Mississippi health care systems, team-based learning spaces, and a state-of-the art interprofessional simulation center.
