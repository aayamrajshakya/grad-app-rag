The MSU S|ARC Acceptance Committee reviews applications as they are received. Decisions are communicated to applicants after the Early Acceptance and General Acceptance deadlines, usually within two weeks. There are 52 seats available in the first-year studio in the fall. As students continue to apply to the program until the first day of class, and as students accept and decline seats, applications are continued to be reviewed and acceptances offered to enroll a class of 52 first-year students. Offering acceptances occurs throughout the spring and summer, with offers extended to the students in order of highest to lowest application scores. Because of our continuous application and review process, predicting acceptances is not possible.
Students accepted to the program will have their major changed to “Architecture” and are enrolled in the accredited, five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree program. No additional review is required of students who maintain the minimum GPA and studio grades.
Students not accepted to the program will remain in the “undeclared-architecture” major. They are considered current MSU students and may be eligible to enroll in the summer after the MSU S|ARC Acceptance Committee reviews their MSU GPA and completed coursework.
For summer acceptance, seats are available for ARC 1536: Design I-A in Summer Session I and ARC 1546: Design I-B in Summer Session II. Community College students, transfer students, and current MSU students who have enrolled in and successfully completed the equivalent of ART 1213: Drawing I and preferably the equivalent of PH 1113: Physics I and PH 1123: Physics II, as well as general education coursework, are eligible for this path into the program. After successful completing the summer studios, students will join the second-year studio in the fall.
