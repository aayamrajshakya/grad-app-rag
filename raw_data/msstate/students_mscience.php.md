Admission and assistantship funding decisions are made by the department’s graduate admissions committee. Prospective students are encouraged to direct enquiries about program admission or assistantship eligibility to the Graduate Coordinator.

## Assistantships
A limited number of research assistantships are available on a competitive basis. These come with a $20,000 annual stipend and a full tuition waiver. 
Students identify their thesis major advisor and research area in their first (fall) semester. While a student’s assistantship work may be tied to a particular faculty member and project, the student can conduct thesis research with any faculty member.

## A Program with You in Mind
Students in our M.S. program work closely with devoted, knowledgeable, nationally- and world-renowned faculty in their respective fields. Students learn how to conduct cutting-edge research using the latest data analysis and modeling methods so that they're prepared to address a wide variety of problems in a Ph.D. program or in the workplace after graduation. Students learn to use data analysis and other software programs they're likely to use after graduation: R, SAS, Stata, MATLAB, and Qualtrics, to name a few. 
Our M.S. program graduates are well positioned to either enter the workforce directly upon graduation or to continue into a Ph.D. program to further develop their skills and expertise. The program stresses mastery of advanced microeconomic theory and quantitative data analysis for application to problems related to agriculture, the environment, health, and more.
Our M.S. program is STEM-designated
* * *
## The Degree
The M.S. program typically takes two years to complete. Requirements include the completion of at least 26 hours of course work and 6 hours of thesis research. Students pursue thesis research topics in natural resource and environmental economics, agricultural risk and risk management, policy, health, behavioral and experimental economics, econometrics, etc. For more information on research conducted by our faculty, see the [individual faculty links](https://www.agecon.msstate.edu/people.php) on our department's website.
