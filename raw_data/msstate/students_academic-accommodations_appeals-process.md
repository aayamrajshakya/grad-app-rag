#  The Disability Appeal and Grievance Process for Students
The Disability Resource Center (DRC) will promptly respond to verbal or written notification from students who are not receiving DRC-approved accommodations. The DRC will communicate in a timely fashion with students and instructors about relevant circumstances, including the complexity of the accommodation and the schedule of the course, program, service, or activity in which the student is participating. Students are expected to contact the DRC as soon as possible if reasonable accommodations are not being implemented in an effective or timely way. The DRC will contact the instructor, teaching assistant, housing staff, facilities management or other relevant party to attempt to resolve the issue. If the DRC is not able to remedy the situation by communicating with these parties, the DRC will contact the appropriate department administrators to discuss implementation of the DRC-approved accommodations. If the DRC-approved accommodation is still not implemented, the DRC will direct the student to follow the grievance procedures set forth below.
If the student with a disability believes that they are not being reasonably accommodated:
  1. The student contacts the DRC as soon as possible if reasonable accommodations are not being implemented in an effective or timely way or if the student is dissatisfied with the provision of services.
  2. For disagreements/issues regarding DRC-approved accommodations, a DRC staff member will work with University personnel and students with disabilities to resolve disagreements/issues regarding recommended accommodations.
  3. For disagreements or concerns about the provision of services by the DRC, a student should first discuss the situation with a DRC staff member. If unable to do this or dissatisfied with the result, a student may contact the Associate Director of the Disability Resource Center at msw84@msstate.edu.
  4. Complaints about the provision of services by the DRC will first be responded to by the Associate Director of the Disability Resource Center. In the case that a complaint involves the Associate Director, the complaint will be responded to by the Director of the DRC at cjd474@msstate.edu. In the case that a complaint involves the Director, the complaint will be responded to by the Assistant Vice President of Student Affairs at jsb487@msstate.edu.
  5. The Associate Director/Director/or Assistant Vice President will consult with all appropriate parties.
  6. A student may appeal the determination regarding an academic accommodation or modification to the Provost and Executive Vice President. A student must submit his/her appeal in writing to the Provost and Executive Vice President. The Provost and Executive Vice President (or his/her designee) will make the final decision regarding the reasonableness of the accommodation or modification. The Provost (or his/her designee) may seek the assistance of the Academic Accommodation Committee in making this determination.
  7. If a student believes that they are being discriminated against because of their disability, the student should contact the Director of Civil Rights Compliance for Mississippi State University at titleix@msstate.edu or 662-325-5839.
