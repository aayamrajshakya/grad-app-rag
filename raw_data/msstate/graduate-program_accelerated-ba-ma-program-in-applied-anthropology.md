#  Accelerated BA/MA Program in Applied Anthropology
Accelerated BA/MA Program in Applied Anthropology
The Accelerated BA/MA Program in Applied Anthropology is designed to enable highly qualified undergraduate students at MSU to earn up to 12 hours of graduate course credit during their final, senior year of undergraduate studies. Students enrolled in the Accelerated program complete graduate level courses (6000-level) and receive dual credit for the equivalent undergraduate course (4000-level). This enables students to get a jump start on their MA degree, beginning their graduate careers while completing their undergraduate studies, and while paying undergraduate tuition.
Interested students must consult with the AMEC Graduate Coordinator before they apply. Students also have to apply and be accepted into the Accelerated BA/MA Program before enrolling in the graduate level (6000-level, 8000-level) classes. Students must also consult the AMEC Graduate Coordinator before enrolling in graduate courses to make sure that their graduate credit can be applied to their program of study for the MA degree in Applied Anthropology.  
Requirements for Admission into the Accelerated BA/MA Program:

Importantly, students are expected to apply to the [MA program in Applied Anthropology](https://www.amec.msstate.edu/undergraduate-program) during the last semester in which they are enrolled in the Bachelor's program at MSU. [Application to the MA program would be made through the standard application process via the Office of Graduate school](http://www.catalog.msstate.edu/undergraduate/collegesanddegreeprograms/officeofthegraduateschool/). Students will receive their Bachelor's degree once the requirements for the Bachelor's degree are met. Students will be required to complete all of the requirements for both the Bachelor's and graduate degrees in order to receive both degrees and those requirements will be identical to the requirements for students enrolled in traditional Bachelor's and graduate degree programs. Students will be classified as undergraduates until they fulfill all the requirements for the undergraduate degree. At that time, upon admission to graduate school, they will be classified as graduate students and will be subject to all the guidelines pertaining to the graduate degree.
