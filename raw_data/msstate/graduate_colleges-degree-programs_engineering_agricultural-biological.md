# Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering
Department Head: Dr. Alex Thomasson Graduate Coordinator: Dr. Steven Elder  
150 Agricultural Engineering Building  
Box 9632  
Mississippi State, MS 39762  
Telephone: 662-325-3282  
E-mail: abe_head@abe.msstate.edu
Graduate study is offered in the Department of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering leading to the degree of Master of Science in Biosystems Engineering or a Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering with a concentration in Biosystems Engineering. Major areas of study include the following:
  * Agricultural machinery systems
  * Precision agriculture
  * Animal waste management
  * Sustainable design
  * Pesticide applications and protection
  * Bioenvironmental systems
  * Seed processing and storage
  * Aquacultural systems
  * Agricultural modeling
  * Bioenergy
  * Agricultural robotics and automation
  * Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence
  * Agricultural sensors and remote sensing


The department has several major research laboratories, such as remote sensing (the Kimbrough Precision Agriculture and Remote Sensing Engineering Laboratory); water quality and environmental engineering; cotton ginning (the MAFES/ABE Mini-Gin, a fully operational cotton gin); and bioenergy. A limited number of graduate research and teaching assistantships are available.
## Admission Criteria
Prerequisites for admission into the graduate program include all the general requirements of the Graduate School, an undergraduate engineering degree (or remedial engineering coursework), and identification of a departmental professor who is willing to serve as research director for the master’s or Ph.D. project. International students must obtain a TOEFL score of 550 PBT (79 iBT) or IELTS score of 6.5 or higher.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
### Contingent Admission
If a student applying to the M.S. program does not have an undergraduate degree in engineering, the student will be required to complete or have previous credit in 51 hours of engineering, mathematics, and physical science courses. The student will be granted contingent admission until the course requirement has been satisfied. Similarly, a student applying to the Ph.D. program must have a B.S. or M.S. degree in engineering. The same set of courses will be required before the student is fully admitted into the Ph.D. program.
## Academic Performance
Unsatisfactory performance in the graduate program in Biosystems Engineering is defined as any of the following
  * Failure to maintain a B average in attempted graduate courses after admission to the program
  * A grade of U, D, or F in any one course
  * More than two grades below a B
  * Failure of the qualifying or preliminary exam (Ph.D. students only)
  * Failure of the research defense
  * Unsatisfactory evaluation of a thesis or dissertation
  * Failure of a required component of the program of study


Any one of these, or a combination of these, will constitute the basis for review for possible dismissal. The graduate coordinator will review the record, along with the student’s graduate committee, and take a final course of action, which will be immediate dismissal or the establishment of a probationary period in which corrective action must take place. Appeal of dismissal can be made by submitting a written appeal statement to the department head. If the dismissal is upheld by the department head upon the student’s appeal, the student can then submit a written appeal to the dean of the College of Engineering.
