**Graduate Student Research Symposium**
The Graduate Student Research Symposium (GSRS) is an interdisciplinary forum comprised of a series of oral and poster presentations by graduate students from across the MSU campus. The GSRS was designed to highlight the quality and variety of graduate-level research at MSU. The GSRS serves as an opportunity for graduate students to gain experience giving presentations and to receive meaningful feedback from an evaluative panel of established MSU faculty members and researchers in a conference-style venue.
The symposium, which is open to the entire Mississippi State University community, provides graduate students an opportunity to present their research and innovative ideas to a broad audience. GSRS presenters must be registered, full-time MSU graduate students who are conducting thesis or dissertation research, and in good academic standing at the time of abstract submission. Selected participants will receive monetary awards in four categories.
**A First place, $150 award, and a Second place, $75 award and a third place, $50 award will be recognized in each**
  * Education, Arts and Sciences, and Business
  * Forest Resources and Veterinary Medicine
  * Agriculture and Life Sciences
