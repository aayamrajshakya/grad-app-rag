## Admission
The Department of Geosciences offers graduate study leading to the Master of Science degree in Geoscience and the Doctor of Philosophy degree in Earth and Atmospheric Science. An applicant to the program must have an undergraduate GPA of at least 2.75 on a scale of 4.00 for entry to the master’s program and at least 3.00 at both the undergraduate and graduate level for entry to the doctoral program.
Although helpful, an undergraduate background in Geosciences is not a prerequisite for admission into the M.S. in Geoscience program. Applicants to the master’s program in the Broadcast or Professional Meteorology concentrations are required to have passed Calculus I prior to arrival on campus, and the completion of Calculus II will greatly improve the chances of being accepted. All other master’s applicants are recommended to have completed Calculus I.
Applicants to the doctoral program are required to have completed a thesis-based master’s degree and have a background in one of the departmental emphasis areas. All applicants for the Doctoral program must
The application package must contain the application for admission; at least three letters of reference; official bachelor’s degree transcript; official transcripts from all colleges attended after earning the bachelor’s degree (both undergraduate and graduate work); and a statement of purpose. A student admitted to the Broadcast Meteorology concentration can only begin studies in the fall term. Applicants desiring assistantship funding consideration are strongly advised to submit the assistantship application no later than January 15.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
The Department of Geosciences follows the Graduate School guidelines regarding academic dismissal from an academic program. Additionally, a grade of U given for thesis or dissertation research hours, three grades of C, or a grade of D or F for any regular class will result in dismissal from the program. A student in the Broadcast Meteorology concentration who earns a C in the first year of graduate study will be required to take a proficiency exam in the summer before the second year. Unsatisfactory performance on the exam will result in dismissal from the program.
## Concentration Descriptions
  * The Applied Meteorology Program
  * The Broadcast Meteorology
  * Environmental Geosciences
  * The Geography
  * The Geology
  * The concentration in Geospatial Sciences
  * The Professional Meteorology/Climatology


## Master of Science Programs of Study
Both a thesis track and a non-thesis track are available at the master’s level for both on-campus and distance learning delivery methods.
### General Departmental Requirements
Both options require competency in statistics or a foreign language. A student enrolled in a non-thesis concentration may petition the graduate faculty to complete a thesis. The department will not approve the request unless a faculty member has agreed to serve as major professor and a committee can be assembled. The department follows the Graduate School guidelines regarding the minimum number of course hours that must be at 8000-level or higher. 
The department has on-campus concentrations in the following areas:
  * Broadcast Meteorology
  * Environmental Geosciences
  * Geography
  * Geology
  * Geospatial Sciences
  * Professional Meteorology/Climatology


The department also offers the following concentrations through distance education:
  * Applied Meteorology Program (AMP)
  * Environmental Geosciences (ENGS)


The AMP is designed for individuals who are already in meteorological, environmental, or hazards-related careers. The Environmental Geosciences concentration is intended for individuals interested in a broader cross-section of the geosciences. The TIG concentration is primarily designed for in-service teachers. 
A student admitted to the Applied Meteorology program (AMP) must hold a B.S. degree in a science and have completed [GR 4713](https://catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=GR%204713 "GR 4713") or its equivalent. A student who is admitted in the graduate program in Geosciences in the Broadcast Meteorology concentration must successfully complete a background assessment test in meteorology. The test will be administered during the spring of each year. A student scoring less than 80% on this test must successfully complete (grade of B or better) GR 1604

### Geospatial and Remote Sensing Certificate
Geospatial technology refers to the acquisition and analysis of spatial data.The Geospatial and Remote Sensing Certificate allows any MSU students from across the University to receive recognition for mastering geospatial coursework. Both undergraduate and graduate certificate degrees are available for both the Starkville and Online education learners. The certificate comprises 15 hours of coursework in four different areas: geographic information systems (3 credit hours), remote sensing (3 credit hours), advanced geospatial course work (3 credit hours), and geospatial applications (6 credit hours). The successful completion of the GRSC will give students the foundation to utilize geospatial technologies within their field and it will provide the opportunity to promote their geospatial mastery to potential employers or potential graduate programs. Interested graduate students should contact either the graduate coordinator or department head. Students must maintain a GPA of 3.00 for the certificate to be awarded. The graduate committee for all doctoral students must be comprised of at least 50% graduate faculty from within the Department of Geosciences.
