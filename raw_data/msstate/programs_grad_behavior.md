# Applied Behavior Analysis
## ABA Master's Overview
The applied behavior analysis (ABA) programs at Mississippi State University (MSU) are designed to provide education, training, and experience to students with the goal of preparing them for practice in real-world settings. Our faculty members are equipped with extensive clinical experiences in the field of behavior analysis and have exceptional teaching, supervision, and research skills. Faculty in the ABA programs share the goal of preparing students to become behavior analysts who provide high quality, evidence-based services to a wide range of ages, populations, and functioning levels in order to make socially significant changes in the lives of others. Currently, our coursework is available both face-to-face and online. 
The master’s program in ABA is designed to meet all [2027 coursework requirements](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.bacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2027-BCBA-Requirements_250423-a.pdf) as outlined by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB); completion of the program meets one of the Behavior Analyst Certification Board’s (BACB) requirements for credentialing as a [Board Certified Behavior Analyst (BCBA)](https://www.bacb.com/bcba/). Our program’s courses are built on requirements outlined in the [BACB’s 6th Edition Test Content Outline](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.bacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BCBA-6th-Edition-Test-Content-Outline-240903-a.pdf). 
The ABA programs at MSU adhere to the scientist-practitioner model, where both faculty and students are expected to be (a) consumers of empirically-based practice, (b) evaluators of their own empirically-based practice, and (c) informed consumers and producers of research that contributes to the field of behavior analysis. While there are no specific research requirements for students in the program at this time, engagement in research at any capacity is encouraged and fostered by faculty in the ABA program.

## Undergraduate ABA Options
Are you an undergraduate student interested in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)?
Our program offers a 15 credit-hour minor (5 courses) in ABA that any student, regardless of their major, can add. If you are an educational psychology (EPY) major, we also offer a concentration in ABA within the major. For more specific information about the minor, including required courses and the course sequence, please review the information in the ABA Undergraduate Minor Handbook (linked below). If you are interested in adding the minor, talk to your advisor first, and then complete the Minor Declaration Form (which can be found in the Handbook) and email it to the ABA Undergraduate Minor Coordinator, Beca Spencer, at bspencer@colled.msstate.edu. If you have any questions about the minor, please contact Beca Spencer.

The ABA program also offers a single course that allows students to be eligible for the Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) certification. This course is available to students enrolled at MSU at either the undergraduate or graduate level. If you are interested in enrolling in this course, please follow the link below for more information.

### Mission Statement
The mission of the ABA program is to prepare students to provide high quality behavior analytic services to a diverse population of individuals by offering excellent training, supervision, and research experiences. More specifically, the mission of the ABA Master’s program at MSU is for students to acquire the knowledge, skills, and experiences necessary to demonstrate competency in applied behavior analysis, as demonstrated by their mastery of criteria outlined by the [Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB) in the 6th Edition Test Content Outline](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/www.bacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/BCBA-6th-Edition-Test-Content-Outline-240903-a.pdf).
### Accreditation
Within the field of ABA, credentialed practitioners at all levels are required to meet a set of standards developed by the Behavior Analyst Certification Board (BACB). Although the standards differ across credentialing options (e.g., BCBA, BCaBA, RBT), completing specific coursework is a requirement for all credentials. Currently, the Association for Behavior Analysis International (ABAI) serves as the accreditation and approval body for all education programs and coursework in ABA. As is common in other disciplines, professional associations often oversee training programs within their discipline, and ABAI manages the verification of course sequences as part of its objective to foster high-quality education in behavior analysis. 
The MSU ABA Master’s Program faculty are in the process of working toward accreditation with ABAI. Current development and modifications of degree requirements are in process in order to meet demands of ABAI’s accreditation expectations and requirements. As of Fall 2026, the program will be eligible to apply for ABAI Recognition at the Tier 2 level. Following that, the program will then go through a full self-study and site visit in order to be considered for full accreditation. The program plans to be accredited well before the 2032 deadline established by ABAI. 
Please note that this does not mean you will receive your BCBA upon completion of this program, as the BACB requires not only completion of coursework in behavior analysis, but also completion of supervised field work and passing of the [credentialing exam](https://www.bacb.com/bcba/).

### FAQ’s
What is applied behavior analysis?   
  
Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is the science of applying the principles of learning to change socially significant behavior. This basically means that we use principles of learning to change behavior that matters. We can use ABA to increase academic skills, communication skills, and functional life skills; we can also use ABA to decrease inappropriate or problematic behaviors that may be negatively impacting a person. 
What will my degree actually be in?   
  
The awarded degree is a Masters in Educational Psychology with a concentration in Applied Behavior Analysis.
Do I need to have experience in behavior analysis to apply to this program?   
  
You do not! While we are excited about applicants who do have experience with behavior analysis, it is certainly not expected or required. 
How many courses will I be expected to take each semester?   
  
If you choose not to enroll in practicum courses, you can expect to take between 2-3 courses per semester. A complete course sequence will be provided to you upon admission.
Can I sit for the BCBA exam after completing this program?   
  
After completing the program and graduating, you will have completed all the required coursework to make you eligible to [take the BCBA exam](https://www.abainternational.org/vcs.aspx). However, in order to sit for the BCBA exam, you will also need to have accrued all the required [experience and supervision hours](https://www.bacb.com/bcba/#BCBAEligibilityRequirements). While those experiences are not required and not built into the program at this time, should you choose to enroll in the practicum courses that are offered by the program OR choose to get experience and supervision hours independent of the practicum courses we offer, you may have accumulated the required experience and supervision hours to sit for the exam.
