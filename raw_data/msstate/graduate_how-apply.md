##  Instructions   

An interested international student should try to complete the application by February 1 for Fall admission in order to receive full attention. The deadline for domestic students is July 1. The department has the policy to only admit a student if we can offer that student an assistantship (teaching or research assistant). We do, in general, not offer Spring admission.
To apply for either our thesis or non-thesis M.S. in Physics or our Ph.D. in Physics graduate program, select Arts & Sciences as the College and Physics as the Major.
To apply for the Applied Physics Ph.D. graduate program, select Bagley College of Engineering as the College, Engineering as the Major, and Applied Physics as the Concentration.

##  GRE Exams   

The GRE exam and GRE subject exam are recommended, but not required; photocopies of GRE scores are accepted.
##  International Students   

The department hosts a variety of international students, with recent admissions from China, India, Nepal, and Iran. 
Financial support offered through teaching and research assistantships is more than enough to cover cost of living through the academic school year. The department also offers optional work for summer semesters.
International students are required to arrange to have an official copy of their TOEFL or IELTS scores sent directly to the MSU Admissions Office; photocopies of TOEFL or IELTS scores are accepted for evaluation purposes.
##  Questions   

Inquiries regarding admission, the graduate programs, and required documents should be addressed to the Physics and Astronomy Department Graduate Coordinator, Dr. Henk Arnoldus.
