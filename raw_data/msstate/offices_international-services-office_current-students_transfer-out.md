#  Transfer Out
Students who wish to transfer to another SEVIS approved school within the US, must request to have their SEVIS record released from MSU to the new school in order to obtain an I-20 from that university.
For the Transfer Release Date, please choose a date after you have completed the current semester or completed any on-campus employment.
Once the required documents are submitted, please allow 5-7 business days to process.
