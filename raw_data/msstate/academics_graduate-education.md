## DVM 
The Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine provides students with a strong, multi-species foundation and allows opportunity to focus on species or discipline interests. MSU CVM is one of only several US colleges of veterinary medicine that—like most colleges of human medicine— requires two full years of mentored clinical education.
Our graduates are highly sought after and are offered opportunities to work all over the world in a variety of different capacities!

## MS and PhD
A number of graduate programs are available through the MSU College of Veterinary Medicine, providing advanced educational opportunities for students in a broad range of biomedical and veterinary sciences. Students may pursue a MS or PhD in Veterinary Medical Science (VMS) or a PhD in Environmental Toxicology (ENVT). The goal of the VMS and ENVT programs is to train the next generation of scientists and educators who will be leaders in biomedical and veterinary research and education.

## Veterinary Medical Technology
MSU CVM is one of only a few colleges where the veterinary medical technology program is housed within the College of Veterinary Medicine. Our VMT students train alongside DVM candidates in the same clinical setting. VMT students enjoy the opportunity to participate in clinical experiences their entire senior year.
At MSU CVM, we pride ourselves in offering a collaborative learning environment. Our top-notch faculty are not only committed to providing an excellent education, but also genuinely care about their students. We offer a family-like atmosphere where students receive the training and support they need to reach their goals and succeed in the field of veterinary medicine.
