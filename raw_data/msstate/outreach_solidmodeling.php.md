# Solid Modeling
* * *
Solid Modeling is a set of techniques and principles for mathematical and computer modeling of three-dimensional solids. It sets itself apart from regular computer graphics by including geometrical data of the solid. This bases supports the foundation of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and helps in the creation, exchange, visualization, animation, interrogation, and annotation of digital models of physical objects.
The use of solid modeling allows for the automation of a multitude of difficult engineering calculations that are carried out within the design and verification process. These now include processes such as machining, assembly, sheet metal manufacturing, injection molding, welding, pipe routing, etc. Solid Modeling also serves as the basis for rapid prototyping, digital data archiving, reverse engineering and mechanical analysis using Finite Element Analysis, motion analysis, and kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms.
Solid Modeling activities at CAVS Extension are led by Jonathan Howell, a Certified SolidWorks Professional years experience. CAVS-E can fit any Solid Modeling need from full design and verification to Finite Element Analysis to one on one Solid Modeling assistance.
Types of Projects:
  * Tool & Fixture Design
  * Product Design and Verification
  * Finite Element Analysis
