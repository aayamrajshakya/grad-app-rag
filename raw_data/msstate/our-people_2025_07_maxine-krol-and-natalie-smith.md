For sisters Maxine Krol and Natalie Smith, what began as a short-term move materialized into a meaningful part of their lives filled with opportunity, growth and family ties. 
Originally from New Lenox, Illinois, Maxine first came to Mississippi State in 2018 for a graduate assistantship in student-athlete support services. 
“I thought I’d be here two years,” she said. “But the more time I spent on campus and in Starkville, the more it felt like home.”
Natalie visited often and eventually followed. She accepted a job in the athletics department’s business office, later moving to a position in the dean of engineering’s office. Smith also enrolled in MSU’s College of Professional and Continuing Studies to pursue a degree in organizational leadership.
“We are a very close family,” Natalie said. “When Maxine moved here, we visited often and fell in love with MSU.”
Their bond grew even stronger when their brother Nolan became a Bulldog as a mechanical engineering student and track-and-field athlete. Later, their oldest sister Lorna moved to Starkville to work as a nurse practitioner.
“We always joked and said, ‘You can’t go anywhere without seeing a Krol in Starkville,’” Maxine said.
In her role as academic counselor for MSU’s baseball and volleyball teams, Maxine guides student-athletes through their academic journey. She reviews eligibility, collaborates with faculty and staff, and supports students through some of their most transformational years.
“They bring energy, determination and a strong work ethic that inspires me,” she said. “The best part of this job is having a front-row seat and watching these students fulfill their dreams.”
Natalie’s path reflects her focus on service and leadership. She credits her mentors for supporting her growth and sees her studies in organizational leadership to give that same support back.
“I want to be someone who inspires and supports others along their journey,” Natalie said. “MSU doesn’t operate because of one person. It thrives because of the dedication of every single staff and faculty member.”
Both sisters value connection, dependability and compassion in their work. These qualities have been shaped by experience, strengthened by community and shared with the students and teams they support.
What brought them to Starkville and MSU was an opportunity. What kept them here was a shared commitment to students, colleagues and the campus they now call home.
