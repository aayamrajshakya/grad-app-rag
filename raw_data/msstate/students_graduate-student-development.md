# Graduate Student Development
The Graduate Student offers a comprehensive range of programs and resources designed to enhance the professional, academic, and personal growth of graduate students. In addition to learning expertise in a discipline while in graduate school, graduate students benefit by taking advantage of opportunities to develop “transferable skills”, those skills that prepare them holistically to excel in their careers, to become leaders, and to lead a balanced life.

Finalists will be displayed at the Union Art Gallery on the second floor of the Union.
### Individual Development Plan
