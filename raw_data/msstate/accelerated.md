# BSE/BME Accelerated Program
The goal of the Accelerated Program in the Department of Agricultural & Biological Engineering (ABE) is to enable highly qualified students to earn up to 9 hours of graduate course credit.
Students who complete approved graduate level courses (6000-level) will receive dual credit for the equivalent undergraduate course (4000-level).
See the [MSU Graduate Bulletin](https://www.grad.msstate.edu/students/graduate-programs) for rules governing this program for more information on accelerated programs in the university.
To be accepted into the Accelerated Program, a student must:
  * be enrolled at Mississippi State University in the Biosystems or Biomedical Engineering major
  * be within 60 credit hours of completing the bachelor's degree
  * have an overall GPA of 3.5 or higher for all undergraduate work
  * [submit an application to the undergraduate coordinator.](https://www.abe.msstate.edu/wp-content/uploads/AcceleratedProgramApplicationForm.pdf)


Once a student has been accepted into the Accelerated Program, he/she is eligible to enroll in graduate level courses. To do so, complete the [Undergraduate Enrollment in Accelerated Program Form](https://www.grad.msstate.edu/sites/www.grad.msstate.edu/files/2023-09/Undergraduate_Enrollment_in_Accelerated_Program.pdf). Submit the completed form to your undergraduate advisor for processing before the first day of classes. A late fee will be assessed for late submissions.
Students interested in graduate study may apply during the final semester of the senior year following the standard procedures and deadlines: <https://www.grad.msstate.edu/students/admissions>. Admission is competitive and is contingent on availability of a suitable project and faculty advisor.
