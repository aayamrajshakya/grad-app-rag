# Pre-Dental
If attending dental school is on your horizon, you should consider an undergraduate degree in biochemistry with a pre-dental concentration. We have taken the guesswork out of what you should take, designing our curriculum to prepare you for the Dental Admissions Test and dental school classes. 
> **[Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/dentists.htm):** Dentists diagnose and treat problems with patients’ teeth, gums, and related parts of the mouth. They provide advice and instruction on taking care of the teeth and gums and on diet choices that affect oral health. Dentists must be licensed in the state(s) in which they work. Licensure requirements vary by state, although candidates usually must graduate from an accredited dental school and pass written and practical exams. The median annual wage for dentists was $164,010 in May 2020. Overall employment of dentists is projected to grow 3 percent from 2019 to 2029.
