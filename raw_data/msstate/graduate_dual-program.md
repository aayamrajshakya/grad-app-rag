#  Dual Program - A short path from master's program to Ph.D. program
The Dual Program _a first-year master's student can apply for a Ph.D. program_. The status of a student admitted to a Ph.D. program through the Dual Program automatically changes to a Ph.D. program as their primary program. As per the GCC's recommendation, an admitted student to the Ph.D. program shall fulfill the Ph.D. program of study as their primary program.
  1. A first-year master's student with a minimum GPA of 3.5 may apply for fall admission to the Ph.D. program.
  2. Three letters of recommendation are required, and the name of a potential advisor (a graduate faculty) is preferred.
  3. The department reimburses the application fees for students admitted through this program during the first semester of starting the primary program.
  4. Upon admission to a Ph.D. program, the GTA stipend rises to a Ph.D. level.
  5. Students admitted to a Ph.D. program through the Dual Program can only fulfill the master's degree requirements after passing the candidacy examination for the Ph.D. degree.
  6. Students admitted to a Ph.D. program through the Dual Program who wish to change their program status will no longer hold the GTA position unless approved by the head of the department. These students shall inform the Graduate Coordinator at the earliest possible date. The following actions need to be taken: 
    1. Fill out the "Change of Program Status" form.
    2. Form a new master's committee by filling out the "Committee Request Form."
