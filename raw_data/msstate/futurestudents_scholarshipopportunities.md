# Scholarship Opportunities
The College of Arts & Sciences and its 14 departments are proud to award over 200 scholarships awarding close to half a million dollars in private scholarship money each year to our students. From the 200 scholarships awarded, around 60 scholarships are awarded from the Dean’s Office alone, adding up to roughly $204,000. The College is incredibly thankful for its alumni, donors, and friends who make these scholarships possible. The impact that a scholarship can have on a student’s college experience is immeasurable.
As one of the university's largest colleges, College of Arts & Sciences students go through a vigorous review and award process that is streamlined through the College of Arts & Sciences scholarship committee. The committee is made up of 14 members representing each of the college’s respective departments.
