# Agricultural and Environmental Soil Sciences
The Agricultural and Environmental Soil Sciences curriculum provides an educational foundation in soil processes involving physical, chemical and biological interrelationships. The soil resource is an integral component of our environment and is subject to loss and degradation through man's activities. Humanity's dependence on soil for food and fiber production and the need for ensuring environmental quality requires individuals trained in the management of this resource. Career opportunities exist both nationally and internationally in agricultural and environmental consulting, agribusiness, government agencies, teaching, and research. Required courses provide soil science training, while elective courses can be selected to meet specific needs. The Agricultural and Environmental Soil Sciences curriculum is in the Agronomy major. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/environmental-scientists-and-specialists.htm): The median annual wage for environmental scientists and specialists was $73,230 in May 2020. Employment of environmental scientists and specialists is projected to grow 8 percent from 2020 to 2030. Heightened public interest in the hazards facing the environment, as well as increasing demands placed on the environment by population growth, are expected to spur demand for environmental scientists and specialists. 
## Curriculum
Mississippi State University is now offering degree programs that may be completed in three years. These undergraduate degree programs are special programs which allow highly motivated and hard-working students the opportunity to complete a degree in three years rather than the traditional four years. Both the three year and traditional four year degree program are available in Agricultural and Environmental Soil Sciences.

## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates at Mississippi State University are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program. This program permits enrollment in graduate courses in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science during the student’s final year of undergraduate studies. Enrollment of up to 9 hours of graduate courses is approved for students admitted to the Accelerated Program. Upon completion of the graduate course(s), undergraduate credit is also awarded for the course. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the M.S. degree. Application to this program may be made as early as the end of the junior year (i.e., after completion of 90 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). This option is only available for students pursuing a thesis-based Master of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science.
