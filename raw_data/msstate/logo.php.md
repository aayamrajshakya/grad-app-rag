# Our Logo
The IGBB logo features a stylized "pinwheel" to the left of the letters IGBB in caps in a modified Bank Gothic Pro font.  
  
  
The six-part "pinwheel" in the IGBB logo is: 
  * A symbol of lab unity as it shows "parts" coming together to make a "whole."
  * A flower or three-leaf clover representing (a) plants, important subjects of our research, (b) life in general, and (c) the life sciences (biology).
  * A set of chromosomes being moved towards the center of a cell.
  * The Sun - another symbol of life.
  * A protein composed of six subunits (e.g., a protein pore).
  * Three foxes putting their heads together. The fox is a symbol of cleverness in Western folklore. Since the IGBB is organized into three service groups (Genomics, Proteomics/Metabolomics, and Biocomputing/Computational Biology), the foxes could represent the three disciplines working together.
  * A scientist jumping for joy after making an important discovery.
  * A windmill, the primary symbol associated with Cervantes' famous character Don Quixote - Like Don Quixote, scientists must be willing to attack 'wicked giants' (e.g., ignorance, racism, sexism, intolerance, use of the term 'science' in the promotion of non-scientific causes), champion worthy causes (e.g., education, intellectual freedom, human rights, environmental responsibility), and remain optimistic in the face of defeat (e.g., most days in the lab). Hopefully, however, the average scientist can accomplish these tasks without becoming delusional (a problem that squashed Quixote's dreams of becoming a plant molecular biologist).
  * A DNA double-helix or protein in cross section.
  * Antibodies binding to a protein.
  * Whatever you want it to be.

ABSTRACT  
The Gene Ontology (GO; http://www.geneontology.org) is a community-based bioinformatics resource that supplies information about gene product function using ontologies to represent biological knowledge. Here we describe improvements and expansions to several branches of the ontology, as well as updates that have allowed us to more efficiently disseminate the GO and capture feedback from the research community. The Gene Ontology Consortium (GOC) has expanded areas of the ontology such as cilia-related terms, cell-cycle terms and multicellular organism processes. We have also implemented new tools for generating ontology terms based on a set of logical rules making use of templates, and we have made efforts to increase our use of logical definitions. The GOC has a new and improved web site summarizing new developments and documentation, serving as a portal to GO data. Users can perform GO enrichment analysis, and search the GO for terms, annotations to gene products, and associated metadata across multiple species using the all-new AmiGO 2 browser. We encourage and welcome the input of the research community in all biological areas in our continued effort to improve the Gene Ontology.
