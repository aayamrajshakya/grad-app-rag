#  First Generation Graduate Student Series
**What is the 1st Generation Grad Student Series?**
This program is open to all first-generation graduate students. First generation graduate students are students whose mother or father did not graduate from a 4-year college or university. The program includes three sessions that will provide students with information on how to navigate graduate school. By incorporating workshops, guest speakers, and panelist from various departments, the information provided will be beneficial for all first generation Master’s or PhD students. In addition, the program includes two casual networking events to build community among peers. 
**Spring 2025 Events**
We will be hosting two socials to help you connect with peers and continue to build community. 
**February 17, 2:00 – 3:30 PM** Coffee Social at Barnes & Noble Cafe
**April 21, 2:00 – 3:30 PM** More information to come.
The Fall 2023 program was sponsored by the Division of Access, Opportunity, and Success through the Inclusion Grant.
