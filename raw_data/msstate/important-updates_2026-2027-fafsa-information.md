# 2026-2027 FAFSA Information
The 2026-2027 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is open
[ Submit the 2026-27 FAFSA Form](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)
The 2026-2027 FAFSA will ask for income data from the 2024 tax year. When completing the FAFSA online, students and contributors who have filed their 2024 federal tax return will have their tax data automatically transferred easily, accurately, and securely directly from the IRS onto their FAFSA form. 
IMPORTANT:
To ensure the processing of financial aid before the fall semester payment due date, the MSU Office of Financial Aid and Scholarships must receive a valid 2026-2027 FAFSA and any required verification documentation before the specified priority dates below:  
April 1  
June 1  
Please note that the submission of the FAFSA or any required verification documentation after these dates does not guarantee that you will be awarded financial aid before the fall semester payment due date.
An FSA ID is required to sign the online FAFSA. Both student and contributor must have their own separate FSA ID. For more information about the FSA ID and how to apply, [Click Here](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/topic/managing_your_account/articles)
Note: The FAFSA is operated by the U.S. Department of Education and has recently undergone changes. If you have questions related to how the FAFSA works, studentaid.gov has a page called [_Filling out the FAFSA Form_](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/filling-out) that provides guidance.
