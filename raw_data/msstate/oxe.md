# Omega Chi Epsilon
Omega Chi Epsilon (OXE) is the National Honor Society for Chemical Engineering. The Society promotes high scholarship, encourages original investigation in chemical engineering, and recognizes the valuable traits of character, integrity, and leadership. Mississippi State University is home to the Alpha Eta chapter, chartered in 1978.
Membership is by invitation only. Eligible juniors must have a cumulative GPA ≥ 3.5 and have completed ≥60 s.h. of credit towards a degree in ChE and ≥9 s.h. of ChE coursework. Eligible seniors must have a cumulative GPA ≥ 3.2 and have completed ≥90 s.h. of credit towards a degree in ChE and ≥9 s.h. of ChE coursework. Initiations are held during fall and spring semesters; officer elections are held at the end of the spring semester.
OXE supports the ChE student body by coordinating a mentoring program between lower-level and upper-level ChE students, organizing tours of local manufacturing facilities, and hosting ChE social hours. Community among OXE membership is promoted through social events and volunteer opportunities.
