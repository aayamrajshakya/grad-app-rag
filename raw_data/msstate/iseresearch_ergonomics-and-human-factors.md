# Human Factors, Ergonomics and Athlete Engineering
The human element in systems design is critical to ensuring optimal performance for both the human and the system. Faculty and students within Industrial and Systems Engineering conduct theoretical and applied ergonomics and human factors research that addresses the human element in any type of system. Research areas include occupational ergonomics and biomechanics, work physiology, human information processing, and usability. ISE faculty members also assist Mississippi companies in improving ergonomics in their facilities. Below are some examples of research projects completed in ergonomics and human factors.
