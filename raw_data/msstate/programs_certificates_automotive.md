# Automotive Certificate/Endorsement
## Contact Information
Dr. John Ball at jeball@ece.msstate.edu
For undergraduates, during your final semester please email the contact above for approval.
## Program Information
The Automotive Engineering Certificate was developed in support of the automotive manufacturing companies in the state of Mississippi to provide students an opportunity to focus on engineering knowledge and issues related to the design of vehicle systems and their production. The program is multi-disciplinary, allowing students from all areas of engineering to participate. Course work can be selected from aerospace engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science engineering, engineering mechanics, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering. All students are required to participate in a vehicle design/construction experience which must be approved by the director of the automotive engineering certificate and will be designated as a three-hour directed individual study (4000-level for undergraduate students/7000-level for graduate students) course. Membership in the student section (or appropriate level) of the Society of Automotive Engineers is strongly encouraged.
## Requirements
To meet the requirements for the Automotive Engineering Certificate, you must complete 15 hours of designated courses. These include one from the Level I list, two from the Level II list, the Automotive Engineering course, and a DIS related to a team experience in automotive engineering.
At least two of the courses must be in addition to the courses required for the student’s graduation from his/her major.
For graduate students, the student’s graduate committee will determine how many of the courses
