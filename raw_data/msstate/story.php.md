## Governors, Industry and Education Leaders Announce Tri-State Manufacturing Partnership
August 27, 2025  
  
[MAGNET](https://magnet.ua.edu/) for short — a regional economic development initiative aimed at leveraging the Southeastern U.S. automotive vehicle and battery industry to stimulate economic development and job growth.  
  
This tri-state initiative, which will be headquartered at The University of Alabama, will create a premier research and development hub for research-enabled mobility innovation that drives economic and workforce development. Joining The University of Alabama are the University of Georgia and Mississippi State University, each with critical expertise in all aspects of the automotive industry and emerging technologies.  
  
A memorandum of understanding solidifying this partnership has been signed by the governors of Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi; the CEOs of Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power and Mississippi Power; and the presidents of The University of Alabama, the University of Georgia and Mississippi State University.  
  
The advanced automotive manufacturing boom is advancing rapidly in the Southeast, presenting the U.S. with a rare economic and national security opportunity to capture global leadership in this critical industry over the next decade. MAGNET, which is among 29 semifinalists in the [second National Science Foundation Regional Innovation Engines competition](https://www.nsf.gov/news/nsf-advances-29-semifinalists-second-nsf-regional-innovation), combines the resources, insights and expertise of leaders in government, academia and business in Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi to support the development of a comprehensive ecosystem that will have significant positive impacts on the prosperity, health and security of Americans.  
  
"In 2023, our three states collectively built 1.9 million cars – further establishing us as national leaders in auto manufacturing," Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey said. "With virtually every auto manufacturer across the globe actively electrifying their fleets, we must position ourselves at the forefront of this transformation."  
  
"The auto manufacturing industry has a huge impact on our economy and creates careers for thousands of hard-working Georgians," Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said. "As the auto industry continues to evolve, it will be important for us to adapt and tackle the opportunities and challenges created by this emerging industry. This partnership will play a key role in positioning our states to meet those challenges and maintain our region's position as the best place to manufacture automobiles."  
  
"Companies across the world are investing billions of dollars into their electric fleets, and we need to be able to make the case that those vehicles should be built here," Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves said. "By bringing together the collective resources and assets of our three states, this partnership will put us at the front of the pack nationally when it comes to innovation in the EV space. This forward-thinking approach will mean jobs and opportunity for countless Mississippi families."  
  
"MAGNET is a game-changing opportunity for Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi to lead in transforming vehicle and battery manufacturing," said UA President Peter J. Mohler. "By uniting the research strengths of our universities with industry and government support, we're driving innovation, workforce development and economic growth across the region."  
  
"We are proud to be a part of this innovative and cutting-edge partnership," said University of Georgia President Jere W. Morehead. "With our campus-wide e-mobility initiative, UGA continues to expand its capacity to impact our state and region through electric vehicle research and outreach aimed at boosting economic and workforce development. Drawing on the rich pool of talent that exists at each of our universities, we look forward to collaborating through MAGNET to shape the future of the Battery Belt region."  
  
"Mississippi State University is a national leader in mobility systems research and development and widely recognized for our collaborative culture and many successful partnerships," said MSU President Mark E. Keenum. "We are honored to join with the State of Mississippi, Southern Company and our peers in Alabama and Georgia on the MAGNET team."  
  
"Auto manufacturing plays an important role in Alabama's economy and throughout the Southeast," said Alabama Power Chairman, President, and CEO Jeff Peoples. "Across the Southern Company system, we are proud to support efforts that advance electric vehicle technology. Working together, we will help drive growth for decades to come."  
  
MAGNET organizes the region's extensive and relevant capabilities and resources into a single, coordinated effort to ensure that the transportation revolution benefits from a well-supported infrastructure, a skilled workforce and a robust innovation pipeline. These efforts will be integrated with the resources and capabilities of team members at The University of Alabama, the University of Georgia and Mississippi State University, as well as the 120-plus entities committed to establishing a secure national asset that will effectively support accelerated U.S. transportation technology and the onshoring of key advanced auto manufacturing capabilities.
