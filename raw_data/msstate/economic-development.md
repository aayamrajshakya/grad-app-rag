# Economic Development
Mississippi State University is working for Mississippi, for the nation, and for the world— and we are ready to work with you. MSU research and economic development initiatives are focused on creating jobs, enhancing quality of life, and providing real world opportunities for our students and alumni, who are the next generation of innovators, inventors, and leaders. 
For decades, we have worked closely with local, state, and federal officials to help recruit industries and domestic and international investments to our state. We've built partnerships between the university, economic development organizations, and businesses to create high-wage jobs and to leverage our innovative research activities. 
MSU will continue to play an important role as our nation's economy continues to grow — in large part because of our faculty’s preeminence in critical research focus areas like cybersecurity and advanced computing, unmanned aircraft and aerospace, agriculture and natural resources, engineering and materials science, and automotive and mobility systems.
