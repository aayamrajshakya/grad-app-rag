The Department of Chemistry at Mississippi State has long set the standard for superior science and outstanding teaching in the Southeast. In addition to our own students, more than fifty percent of all MSU undergraduates take at least one laboratory course in the Department of Chemistry before graduation. This fact underscores the breadth of the audience that will hear our messages about science, and its role in society.
