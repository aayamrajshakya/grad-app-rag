# Food Science and Technology
A Food Scientists solves problems by applying science to food (biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, biochemistry, physics, etc.) to ensure that the food products that reach consumers are both safe and meet quality standards. Students who graduate with a bachelor's degree in food science can work in the areas of product development, quality control, technical sales, production management, veterinary science, as well as other areas such as food law and food packaging. The Food Science & Technology concentration is in the Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion major.
