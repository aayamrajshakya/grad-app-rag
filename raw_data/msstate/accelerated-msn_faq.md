  * Classroom sessions are characterized by case-based or simulated patient care experiences, providing students with opportunities to apply their knowledge. The educational model aims to swiftly transition students from acquiring knowledge to its practical application and eventual competency. This involves a continuous cycle of demonstration, feedback, evaluation, and correction.
  * The first term follows a boot camp style, delivering content through an immersive, condensed course format. Subsequently, the remainder of the term is dedicated to application-level learning experiences. Simulated clinical experiences, including the use of Standardized Patients, are integrated early and consistently to support competency-based evaluation. This approach ensures that students not only grasp theoretical concepts but also develop and demonstrate practical skills in a supportive and interactive learning environment.
