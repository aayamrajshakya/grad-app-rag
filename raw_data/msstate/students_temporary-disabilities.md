#  Temporary Disabilities
The DRC recognizes that individuals with temporary resulting from injuries, surgery, or short-term medical conditions may need accommodations similar to individuals with permanent disabilities.
To receive accommodations for a temporary disability, the student must submit documentation to DRC indicating the type of disability, severity, limitations, prognosis, and estimated duration of the disabling condition. Additional documentation may be requested to verify the need for continued services after the estimated duration of the condition has expired.
Examples of temporary disabilities may include, but are not limited to:
  * Broken limbs
  * Hand injuries
  * Short-term impairments following surgery or medical treatments
