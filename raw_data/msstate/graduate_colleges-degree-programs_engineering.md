**Application Deadlines**
Applications for the degree programs are reviewed three times a year and are different from the university published deadlines. The application deadlines for all students are as follows:
  * Fall Semester – June 1
  * Spring Semester – November 1
  * Summer Semester – May 1


Note: Some departments may have earlier deadlines. Please refer to departmental pages for program specific deadlines.
## Degree and Certificate Programs
The BCoE offers 12 master’s and 12 doctoral degree options. All programming, unless otherwise noted, is offered at the Starkville Campus and through Online Education. Students wishing to switch degree program must apply and be admitted to that program unless the student wishes to change levels within a degree program (move from PhD in ISE to MS in ISE for example). As such, students are strongly encouraged to speak with the new program before submitting a new application. Direct admit students wishing to earn the MS degree along the way must apply to that MS program by the deadline before their terminal semester. For additional information, please speak with your graduate coordinator regarding the requirements for the MS degree before applying to the MS program.

### Stand-Alone Certificate Programs
Stand-alone certificate programs are programs in which students can apply directly to that certificate without being a degree seeking student. MSU and the BCoE strongly support the use of these stand-alone certificate programs to be used for degree fulfillment should a student decide to apply and be admitted into a BCoE graduate program upon completion of the certificate program.
Athlete Engineering Certificate 
The Athlete Engineering Certificate comprises 12 credit hours in different human performance, processes, and analysis fields, all originating out of Industrial & Systems Engineering but in classes that partner with other engineering disciplines and Kinesiology and Human Science experts and faculty. This is a graduate only certificate, and all applicants must have already completed a bachelor’s degree to be eligible for admissions. Successful applicants must have a STEM undergraduate degree from an accredited university. Fields such as Science, Math, Engineering, Technology, Information Systems, Kinesiology, and other Health-related subjects would be suitable as a background degree for this certificate program.
For more information about the online Athlete Engineering Certificate, please visit <https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/certificates/>.
Note: The following certificates are not stand-alone programs and must be completed in conjunction with either an undergraduate or graduate degree program:
  * Automotive Engineering
  * Computational Biology
  * Information Assurance Professional Certificate
  * Materials Engineering


Online Education
The Bagley College of Engineering offers 10 MS and 10 PhD programs online. For more information about the college’s online programs, please visit [https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/online/programs/](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/distance/programs/).
