# Advanced Manufacturing and Production Systems
In order for a company to maintain competitiveness in today’s market, they must be concerned about effective and efficient processes across all areas of the manufacturing enterprise. ISE faculty have been engaged in both basic and applied manufacturing-related research. These include projects that have helped companies located both within the state and nationwide.
Associate Professor, Dr. Linkan Bian, has been leading key research in the area of laser-based additive manufacturing. You can learn more about his work on the [Center for Advanced Vehicular Systems](http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/research/additive_manufacturing.php) website.
