## Doctoral Degree in Molecular Biology
The Molecular Biology Ph.D. degree is primarily a research degree. A minimum of 30-40 hours of coursework and 30 hours of research beyond the B.S. degree are required. A student entering the program with a master’s degree will be required to take 30-40 hours past that degree.

## Admission Criteria
Final acceptance into a graduate program is contingent upon the availability of a suitable major professor.
  * A bachelor’s or master’s degree in a physical or life science with a strong background in the program discipline of interest (biochemistry, molecular biology, entomology, or plant pathology).
  * A minimum 2.75 overall GPA on a 4.00 scale.
  * Scored results of the GRE general test recommended but not required.
  * International students are required to have a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score of 500 PBT (61 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 5.5 (non-English speaking international students)


Provisional Admission:
The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student’s program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall be dismissed from the graduate program.
While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
