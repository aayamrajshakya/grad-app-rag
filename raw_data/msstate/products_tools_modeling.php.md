## Modeling Products & Tools
[](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/data-products/#oadata)
#### Ocean Acidification Product Suite
offers tools to monitor ocean acidification over the wider Caribbean and Gulf of America, utilizing satellite data and a data-assimilative hybrid model to map the components of the carbonate system of surface water.

#### The National Weather Model
is a hydrologic modelling framework that simulates observed and forecast streamflow over the entire continental U.S. at a very fine spatial and temporal scale.

#### Atmospheric River Analysis & Forecast System
is a high-resolution regional model for real-time forecasts of atmospheric rivers (weather phenomena that drive heavy rain events that often cause floods) for Northeast Pacific and Western North America.

#### Ensemble Sensitivity Technique for Atmospheric River Analysis
informs decision-making when planning for reconnaissance missions by identifying and suggesting areas for data collection flight paths.

#### Gulf of America Biogeochemical Model Outputs
contains surface patterns of temperature, salinity, total alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon from 1981 to 2014 using the GoMBio model, a ROMS-based 8-km resolution ocean-biogeochemical model for the entire Gulf of America.
