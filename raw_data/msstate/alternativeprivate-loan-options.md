###  [ Alternative/Private Loans ](https://www.elmselect.com/v4/school/41/program-select)
For Graduate or Undergraduate Students –Students who do not qualify for federal financial aid, or who need additional funds beyond what federal financial aid can provide, have an option of applying for an alternative (private or non-federal) educational loan. Alternative loans are generally more expensive, therefore should only be considered if absolutely necessary. In most cases, the student applicant's credit and/or co-signer's credit must be approved by the lender. The eligible loan amount can be no greater than the Cost of Attendance minus all other Estimated Financial Aid. Completing the FAFSA is not a requirement for the Private Alternative Loans.
