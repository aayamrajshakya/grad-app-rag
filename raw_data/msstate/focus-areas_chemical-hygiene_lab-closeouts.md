#  Lab Closeouts
Vacated labs must be closed out through EH&S to account for any hazards that were present in the research space. It is imperative for all labs and support areas to be appropriately closed out in accordance with the [Lab Closeout Reference Guide](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-11/Lab%20Closeout%20Reference%20Guide.pdf "Lab Closeout Reference Guide").
### Lab Closeout Criteria:
The lab closeout process is prompted whenever: 
  * The Principal Investigator is leaving the University;
  * The Principal Investigator is relocating to a new laboratory at the University;
  * The Principal Investigator is relocating to an off campus location;
  * The space is being vacated for renovations or closure.


### Lab Closeout Process:
  * Inform EH&S with at least 30 days advanced notice of any upcoming lab closeouts through submission of a [Lab Closeout Review service request](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/forms/request-service). 
  * Upon receiving the closeout request, EH&S may reach out to learn more about the lab closeout. Furthermore, this notification provides a direct line of communication with EH&S subject matter experts who can assist with any questions or concerns. 
  * Parities responsible for vacating the lab space will need to complete the [Lab Closeout Checklist](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-11/Lab%20Closeout%20Checklist.pdf "Lab Closeout Checklist"). 
  * Upon submitting the completed checklist to EH&S, a Lab Closeout Review will be scheduled. If any concerns are noted during the closeout review, they will be relayed to the responsible parties. Once the noted concerns are fully resolved and EH&S has affirmed that hazards have been appropriately mitigated, the lab will be formally closed out. 
  * Please bear in mind that radioactive materials laboratories must be decommissioned in accordance with state/federal regulations. The decommissioning of these areas is overseen by the MSU EH&S Radiation Safety program. 


### Equipment Decontamination:
  * As referenced in the Lab Closeout Checklist, all potentially-contaminated surfaces and equipment must be properly decontaminated. The decontamination of biological and/or chemical contaminated equipment must be documented using the [Equipment Decontamination Form](https://www.ehs.msstate.edu/sites/www.ehs.msstate.edu/files/2024-11/Equipment%20Decontamination%20Form.pdf "Equipment Decontamination Form"). Equipment potentially contaminated with radioactive materials must be decommissioned through EH&S Radiation Safety.
