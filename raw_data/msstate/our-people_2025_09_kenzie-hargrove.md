For Mississippi State doctoral student Kenzie Hargrove, research is more than a dissertation—it’s a way to give back to Mississippians who hold a special place in her heart.
The Georgetown, Texas, native is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in exercise science. Prior to MSU, Hargrove worked on a farm in Clinton while finishing her master’s degree and developed a deep appreciation for the farming industry. Now, she is combining her expertise in kinesiology with her love for the agricultural community in her research.
This summer, Hargrove traveled across the Magnolia State to conduct hydration research among agricultural workers through MSU’s Human Energetics and Thermoregulation Lab. She said while there is a lot of hydration data on athletes and firefighters, there is not much on farmers.
“These agricultural workers are a very understudied population, yet they contribute a ton to our economy and state overall,” Hargrove said. “What they do is pretty incredible, especially considering how hot it gets here. To me, they are amazing.”
As part of her research, she is tracking farmers’ hydration and, in some cases, their energy expenditure. Not only will the information be used for her dissertation, but she is also using the data to help farm workers. She’s giving each one their complete data and a personalized hydration recommendation based on their sweat rate.
“The ones I’ve given a report to get really excited about it, which is very fulfilling to me,” Hargrove said. “I tell the workers, ‘If you stay well hydrated today, it’s going to help you get back out and continue working tomorrow.’”
Hargrove praised MSU’s Department of Kinesiology for its support during her research, especially Department Head JohnEric Smith.
“I can’t say enough about how much I appreciate my mentor and advisor, Dr. Smith,” Hargrove said. “I truly think he’s the best professor and advisor I could have gotten for my doctorate.”
With the kinesiology department’s new home in the Jim and Thomas Duff Center now open, Hargrove said she is excited to be in the new space. But, she also expressed her appreciation for the journey.
“I’ve been here during an interesting period—the transition from McCarthy Gym to our temporary spaces and now to the Duff Center,” Hargrove said. “Through it all, I’ve learned really well how to adapt and think on my feet. The department has always had more faith in me than I’ve had in myself, and it’s really pushed me to believe I can take on a project like this. I wouldn’t choose anywhere else to earn my doctorate.”
