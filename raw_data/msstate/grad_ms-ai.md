# M.S. in Artificial Intelligence
With the ongoing expansion of artificial intelligence across industries and the critical need for professionals who can master the rigorous theoretical foundations and employ practical applications, our Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence is just the program for you! This program is designed to meet the growing market demand for AI expertise by offering a curriculum that combines core courses in machine learning, soft computing and computer science theory with flexible elective options that allow students to specialize in domain-specific applications or deepen their quantitative skills. The program includes advanced computer science theory and artificial intelligence/machine learning courses and allows exploration of application areas. We leverage our strong background and faculty expertise in AI research and education and our ongoing activities in AI to deliver a program which will foster innovative research and academic training and prepare graduates to serve as leaders in the field.
Students may choose between a courses-only non-thesis or thesis option. This program will also be offered online.
CSE's artificial intelligence master's program:
  * requires students to complete a foundational curriculum in computer science theory and AI/ML
  * facilitates the expertise gained in the CS and AI/ML core to provide a basis for further exploration


## Program of Study
The MS AI degree is a 31 credit program designed to be completed in 2 years for traditional students. Students must select either a thesis or a non-thesis option in their program of study. Working with [a major professor and guiding committee,](https://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/graduate-handbook/committees/) students will select appropriate core and elective courses to develop mastery. This mastery will then be demonstrated as part of a comprehensive exam (which may include a thesis defense as appropriate).
  * [Thesis option](https://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/ms-ai/thesis/ "AI Thesis Option")
  * [Non-thesis option](https://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/ms-ai/non-thesis/ "AI Non-thesis Option")


Regardless of the program of study chosen, certain policies apply to all coursework chosen. Please refer to our [Graduate Handbook](https://www.cse.msstate.edu/grad/graduate-handbook/) for these additional policies.
