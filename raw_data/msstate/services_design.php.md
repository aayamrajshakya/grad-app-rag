# Graphic Design
OPA’s graphic design team helps campus clients reach their audiences through a strong visual identity within the university’s consistent brand. Quality service and timely delivery are part of the team’s core responsibilities, along with aiding clients in gaining more success for their campus units. Print materials such as brochures and postcards are among the most requested assets, along with e-newsletters, digital flyers, web advertisements and more. Accurate, tightly edited, and well-designed materials are the result of the design team’s complimentary services produced in a one-stop shop. Campus clients only pay expenses for printing and shipping, while OPA designers assist with identifying commercial printers and even licensed vendors who produce specialty items such as T-shirts, writing pens and mugs.

## How to Start
**[Submit a project request form](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/designrequest)** ; a designer will be assigned to the request.  

WHAT IS NEEDED  
  
Submit the publication text via the automated email sent to clients after submission of the project request form or by simply emailing the designer assigned to the project 
Send text copy prepared using the following file formats: .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, .ppt, .pptx, .txt, rtf. File formats not accepted include: .pub - Publisher files.
Files created in other applications, like Publisher or Canva, should be exported as a PDF and also have their text of the piece copied and pasted into a Word document to share with OPA.
In preparing the text document with the content, it is best to avoid using italic, boldface, centering or underlining in this document. In fact, there is no need to format text at all. OPA editors and designers will format it while preparing it for publication.
Also, it is helpful to know the project’s budget. OPA designers are adept at working within budget constraints.  
  
PAPERWORK AND PROOFS  
  
Clients are able to correct errors or make changes before a publication is sent to the printer. A hard copy proof also can be requested for approval. However, changes at this stage can result in extra charges. In most instances, the publication will be printed by the printer that submits the lowest quote, based on specifications provided.  
  
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST  
  
There is no charge for editorial or design services. Billing for printing is sent directly from our office to the appropriate office, college, department or school.  
  
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?  
  
Each publication is tailor-made to serve specific areas of the campus community. Therefore, allow ample time for the many production steps to minimize chances of error and ensure quality design. Also consider and allow for production time with the print vendor when placing a request. This timeline can vary, but it is typically 10-14 business days from receiving files to the delivery of the printed product – depending on the size and quantity of the piece.
UNIVERSITY SYMBOLS  
OPA also can help in matters involving the university symbols and can provide electronic versions of these symbols. For correct symbol usage, take a look at the university’s [Visual Identity Manual](http://www.brand.msstate.edu/identity/index.php).  
  
WHY DO I NEED HELP DESIGNING?  
  
Graphic design is crucial to the success of publications. They can attract attention and help focus readers on the intended message that will be in competition for the reader’s attention with countless other written communications. No matter how important the message, it may not be received if the publication is not packaged effectively. OPA’s publications group takes pride in professionally designed publications, which not only are national award winners but also have been praised by campus clients and their constituents.  
  
WHY DO I NEED HELP EDITING?  
  
Editors not only perform copy editing; they also review a publication for structure and organization. Good editing organizes the written material for unity, coherence and emphasis. OPA editors have vast experience in explaining what is important about Mississippi State University. They know what areas should be emphasized in a particular publication and have the most up-to-date facts and figures at their fingertips.  
  
WHAT IF I NEED PHOTOGRAPHS?  
  
Contact OPA Photographic Services with questions and for information regarding photography needs. Visit the [photography request form](https://form.jotform.com/msstateopa/photo-request) to inquire about photos and how to access them.
