# Certificates & Endorsements
Certificates or endorsements are available to traditional and non-traditional students who meet all admission requirements. Students must be admitted to Mississippi State University in order to pursue certificates or endorsements. Prerequisite courses are required in order to qualify (normally satisfied at the undergraduate level). Some engineering programs may be available to non-engineering graduate students. Please refer to the specific certificate or endorsement of interest for prerequisite requirements and availability to non-engineering graduate students.
All certificates and endorsements require that a student take a minimum of 15 hours of academic credit (5 courses) in an approved area and may be earned by completing selected courses from a list of qualifying courses designated by a representative faculty member or committee. Hours earned in acquiring a certificate or endorsement may be counted toward completion of an advanced engineering degree. A graduate student must achieve a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.00 on courses taken to acquire a certificate. Upon satisfactory completion of the required course work, the student will become a candidate for certification. The MSU transcript will indicate successful completion of the program. Contact information is provided below for each program.
Endorsements (Undergraduate) 
Automotive Engineering 
The Automotive Engineering Endorsement was developed in support of the automotive manufacturing companies in the state of Mississippi to provide students an opportunity to focus on engineering knowledge and issues related to the design of vehicle systems and their production. The program is multi-disciplinary, allowing students from all areas of engineering to participate. Course work can be selected from aerospace engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science and engineering, engineering mechanics, industrial engineering, and mechanical engineering. All students are required to participate in a vehicle design/construction experience which must be approved by the director of the automotive engineering certificate and will be designated as a three-hour directed individual study (4000-level for undergraduate students/7000-level for graduate students) course. Membership in the student section (or appropriate level) of the Society of Automotive Engineers is strongly encouraged.

Computational Biology 
The Computational Biology Endorsement combines course work in computer science and biology to offer students a formal program of study to address how biological systems work by analyzing the data made available with high throughput biology. Students will gain fundamental skills in computing integrated with biology (i.e., application techniques to understand the structures, functions, dynamics and evolution of living organisms) and will become competitive for high-end employment in emerging technical fields. The program will provide students with recognition of their training in the area and will allow students from many disciplines to learn together.

Energy 
This program has been designed for engineering students who plan to pursue a career in energy related fields. The Energy Endorsement utilizes courses in most MSU engineering programs plus a required course in alternate energy sources. Students who successfully complete the Energy Endorsement will have acquired significant energy engineering expertise in their related engineering disciplines as well as an interdisciplinary overview of energy and sustainable energy concepts.
Upon completion of the Energy Endorsement, students should have achieved the following student learning outcomes:
  * Demonstrated an awareness and broadened perspective of energy issues.
  * Developed a more in-depth technical understanding of an energy area(s).
  * Successfully gained knowledge of and perspective for alternate energy sources.

Entrepreneurship 
This program has been designed for engineering students who plan to pursue a career combining technical and business skills. This could include a business startup or working for an entrepreneur in the early years of the business. The endorsement also enhances the engineering program for students interested in corporate management.

Materials 
The Materials Endorsement recognizes the completion of an organized plan of study in the interdisciplinary materials-related areas. Courses for the certificate cover topics on advanced composites, biomaterials, materials processing, polymers and electrical materials. Through the combination of research and engineering, students may choose to specialize their endorsement in any two additional areas of study that include: aerospace, biomedical, chemistry, computer, environmental, forest products, mechanical and physics.

Certificates (Graduate) 
Athlete Engineering 
Mississippi State University Online has created a first-of-its-kind Athlete Engineering research program from a collaboration between Mississippi State University Athletics, Bagley College of Engineering, the Department of Kinesiology, and the School of Human Sciences. This research program uses both laboratory equipment and sport-specific wearable technologies to explore human performance.
The flexibility of the Athlete Engineering Certificate allows any Mississippi State Online student and practitioner across the worlds of sports, industry, and military to receive recognition for mastering human factors techniques and technology solutions focused on human performance outcomes as well as the comfort and fit versus effectiveness expectation.
The successful completion of the Athlete Engineering certificate will expand students' foundation and understanding of the utilization of human performance, processes, and analysis methodologies within their fields.
