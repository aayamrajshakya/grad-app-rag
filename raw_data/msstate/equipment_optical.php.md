### Optical Microscope
Optical microscope is the general term used for microscopes that use visual light and glass lenses to perform magnified observation of objects. Because they have historically been used to observe organisms such as microorganisms and the cells of plants and animals, they are also called biological microscopes.  
  
Keyence VHX-7000  
  
The VHX-7000 Series is a fully-automated digital microscope system that enables even novice users to capture high-resolution images that rival an SEM. The Optical Shadow Effect Mode features a combination of specially designed high-resolution lenses, a 4K CMOS, and high-performance lighting that enables minute surface details to be observed and analyzed. The seamless transition in magnification from 20x to 6000x using a motorized turret offers a stress-free observation environment. The VHX-7000 Series 4K industrial digital microscope offers the highest level of automation and best picture quality in the VHX Series.
