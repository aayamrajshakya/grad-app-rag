In Mississippi State University’s College of Education, we’re translating knowledge into impact. In FY25 we were awarded $20.8 million for research.
From increasing access to behavioral health services to developing new technologies for persons with disabilities, our faculty and students are finding innovative solutions to today’s tough challenges.
We’re proud to house transformative centers and the new Mississippi Institute on Disabilities, as well as faculty-led research labs that provide hands-on learning opportunities for students. Labs include human health and performance, academic and behavior intervention, and virtual reality applications in industry and design.
If you’re interested in getting involved in research, contact your advisor or Dr. Dan Gadke, College of Education associate dean of research, at dgadke@colled.msstate.edu.
