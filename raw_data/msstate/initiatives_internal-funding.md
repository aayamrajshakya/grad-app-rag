# Internal Funding
The Office of Research and Economic Development (ORED) coordinates a number of funding programs for faculty at MSU. Questions concerning these opportunities should be addressed to Alena Jones at [ajones@research.msstate.edu](https://www.ored.msstate.edu/initiatives/ajones@research.msstate.edu) or (662)325-9671.
# Advancing Collaborative Research Program
Consistent with Office of Research goals to spur interdisciplinary research and establish new partnerships within and beyond the institution, the Advancing Collaborative Research Program (ACR) is meant to encourage internal and external collaboration; enable new teams and/or new lines of research; and advance high-potential, high- impact activities to the next level. A successful ACR concept would be of sufficient caliber to achieve several of the following outcomes: 
  * Promote productive and sustainable interdisciplinary research collaborations among faculty that would otherwise be unlikely to occur.
  * Promote work that is high risk, high return, with a potential for high reputational impact.
  * Position MSU faculty to compete successfully for significant external funding and long-term sustainability of the research endeavor.
  * Promote the development of research activities with significant, long-term commercial potential and/or broad community or global impact.


The ACR Program enables such opportunities by supporting research and scholarship that is leading-edge, interdisciplinary, and lays the groundwork for centers of excellence at Mississippi State University.
Proposal submission will be opening soon!

# ORED Support for Writing for The Conversation
Publishing your work in The Conversation communicates MSU’s scholarly activities to wider audiences and increases the public’s understanding about the types of work being done at MSU. In order to recognize the importance of sharing research with a wide variety of audiences ORED will provide a $500 incentive for any MSU faculty member whose work is successfully published in The Conversation.

# Travel Grants
### ORED Travel Grant applications for trips scheduled between January 1, 2026 and June 30, 2026 must be submitted by November 1, 2025!
The ORED Travel Grants are supplemental grants to support faculty travel expenses for presenting research findings at professional conferences, showcasing creative works, or other means of disseminating MSU scholarly activity in professional forums. The grants can also be requested to meet with program managers at funding agencies in the faculty’s scholarly discipline, particularly if they haven’t secured external funding yet. 
The ORED Travel Grant resources are limited and therefore awards will be made on a competitive basis. The program will supplement departmental support by providing matching funds (1:1) up to $2,000 per travel. Funds will not be provided for travel that occurred before the application has been reviewed and approved. 
Applications must be submitted by the application close date to be considered and will be routed to the appropriate department head and associate dean for research before being reviewed by ORED. 
July 30 - December 30 travel grant funding has been committed. Applications are being accepted for travel scheduled to take place after January 1, 2026. Applications must be submitted by November 1, 2025 for travel starting January 1, 2026 and ending June 30, 2026.

Eligibility
The SEC Visiting Faculty Travel Grant Program is intended to enhance faculty collaboration that stimulates scholarship initiatives between SEC universities.

# Undergraduate Research Program
The ORED Undergraduate Research Program is intended to foster innovative, faculty-directed research opportunities for undergraduate students. This program is distinct from and complementary to other undergraduate research programs at MSU.
A wide range of projects will be considered as long as the budget explicitly supports undergraduate research. The ideal project will engage one or more undergraduate student(s) in meaningful scholarly activity and may produce results that can be incorporated into a publication or presentation or serve as preliminary results for a proposal submission. Applications for undergrad research projects are due in the spring of each year.
Proposals for the Undergraduate Research Program are due by April 14th.
