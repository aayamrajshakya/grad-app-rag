### LANGUAGE PLACEMENT EXAM 
If you have prior knowledge in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Chinese, or Russian either from high school or another experience, you may find the appropriate level of language for you by taking the non-credit, diagnostic, web-based placement exam, Emmersion. Emmersion responds to your ability by offering you successively harder or easier questions to assess your level of proficiency. At the end of the exam, you will be given a score which you can use to find a recommended starting level here at MSU. It is important to understand that our placement exam is meant solely to aid you in finding the right level in which to start and that no credit hours will be earned. Credit by examination information for the AP, CLEP and IB tests can be found farther down on this page.
The Emmersion exam is administered online and may take 15-30 minutes to complete. To get started, click on the link below. You will create an account, pay for the exam and then take a short survey. The exam costs $10, payable by credit card.
