“The new feed mill will benefit the department from an educational standpoint by allowing students to gain a hands-on approach with the equipment. It will also enable the department to continuously improve research techniques and opportunities with state-of-the-art equipment that is also being used in the poultry industry.”

“Having had the opportunity to spend a summer interning at a feed mill, I've learned the importance of pellet quality and how it can have a major effect on broiler performance. A new feed mill here at Mississippi State would allow us to conduct research at the highest level and not only improve bird performance in our trials, but the industry as well.”

“A new feed mill will help me learn more aspects of poultry nutrition as well as feed manufacture which I hope to take some time back to my country Guatemala.”

"This past Fall semester, we were granted the opportunity to conduct an undergraduate research trial through the MSU Poultry Department. From formulating the diets to processing, we were there every step of the way with an exception of manufacturing the feed. By the addition of a feed mill at the MSU Poultry Research Farm, this will provide hands-on learning experience for students pursuing their future endeavors in the poultry industry."

Committed  ~ $3.5M Goal  ~ $5M See Current Levels
We are closing in on our fund-raising goal. We hope to secure gift agreements by December 31, 2025, and fulfillment of gift pledges by December 31, 2026, to close the remaining funding gap. While $1.5M is still a significant amount, this is the closest we’ve ever been to making the feed mill a reality. We’re optimistic that a clear plan, proposals, and increasing industry support will help us get across the finish line.
