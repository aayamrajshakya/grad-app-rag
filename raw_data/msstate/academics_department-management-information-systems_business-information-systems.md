#  Business Information Systems
The Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a major in Business Information Systems (BIS) prepares students for a variety of careers in corporate, industrial, governmental, and military establishments. Business information systems provide information that organizations use to manage themselves efficiently and effectively, typically using computer systems and technology. Primary components of business information systems include hardware, software, data, procedures (design, development, and documentation) and people. Students majoring in BIS will study how to utilize information systems and technology to improve the flow of business and business decision-making.
This program is excellent for students who enjoy working with computers and technology. Through the facilities of the academic departments and the university’s Information Technology Services (ITS) unit, BIS students have a unique opportunity to acquire both professional education and experience in business data processing and management information systems.
