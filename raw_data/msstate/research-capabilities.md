#  RESEARCH CAPABILITIES 
## Research Focus Areas
The present U.S. air traffic control system is not well equipped to handle UAS traffic, underscoring the importance of Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), which will allow UAS to be operated safely and efficiently inside domestic airspace. FAA aircraft certification rules must also keep up with the demand for UAS design, production and operation in the United States. Listed below are the different project categories for research conducted by Assure members and partners.
