  3. Integrated Crop Management


# Integrated Crop Management
Integrated Crop Management is the study of food and fiber production utilizing ecologically sound and technologically advanced methods. Areas covered include basic concepts for plant science and specific practices in crop initiation, culture, harvesting, processing, distribution and marketing. Biotechnological and traditional methods of germplasm enhancement are taught. Specific program areas of study include agronomic crop production, crop science, fruit science, seed science, seed technology, and vegetable crop production. Students completing the Integrated Crop Management curriculum are prepared for careers as producers, consultants, technical representative plant breeders, extension agents, or inspectors with USDA and state agencies. This curriculum also provides a good background of basic sciences for those who wish to pursue graduate studies. The Integrated Crop Management concentration is in the Agronomy major. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/agricultural-and-food-scientists.htm): The median annual wage for agricultural and food scientists was $68,830 in May 2020. Overall employment of agricultural and food scientists is projected to grow 9 percent from 2020 to 2030, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Employment of agricultural and food scientists is projected to grow as research into agricultural production methods and techniques continues. 
## Curriculum
Mississippi State University is now offering degree programs that may be completed in three years. These undergraduate degree programs are special programs which allow highly motivated and hard-working students the opportunity to complete a degree in three years rather than the traditional four years. Both the three year and traditional four year degree program are available in Integrated Crop Management.

## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates at Mississippi State University are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program. This program permits enrollment in graduate courses in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science during the student’s final year of undergraduate studies. Enrollment of up to 9 hours of graduate courses is approved for students admitted to the Accelerated Program. Upon completion of the graduate course(s), undergraduate credit is also awarded for the course. Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the M.S. degree. Application to this program may be made as early as the end of the junior year (i.e., after completion of 90 or more hours of graded undergraduate courses). This option is only available for students pursuing a thesis-based Master of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a concentration in Agronomy, Horticulture, or Weed Science.
