## An Interdisciplinary Program
The Master of Agribusiness Management (M.A.B.M.) program is an interdisciplinary degree between the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Business, and is administered by the Department of Agricultural Economics. The program is designed to prepare students for employment in the management of agribusiness. Graduate coursework for the Starkville campus program may begin only during the Summer semester, while coursework for the online program may begin during the Fall, Spring, or Summer semester. Research assistantships are not available for students in the M.A.B.M. program. Additional information is found at the department’s website, [www.agecon.msstate.edu](http://www.agecon.msstate.edu/).
## Admission Criteria
An applicant for admission to graduate study must hold a bachelor’s degree from a fully recognized four-year educational institution that has unconditional accreditation with appropriate regional accrediting agencies. The applicant must meet the admission requirements of the Graduate School and the Master of Agribusiness Management Program. Admission is based primarily on past performance, and letters of recommendation. Regular admission to graduate study in the M.A.B.M. program requires a minimum grade point average (last four semesters of undergraduate work) of 3.00/4.00. When a student is deficient in one of the criteria cited, the student’s application, nevertheless, may be considered for admission based on the strength of other materials contained in the student’s application. However, reasonable minimum levels of performance must be achieved in both the applicant’s GPA. International applicants not holding degrees from U.S. institutions must submit a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) report of 575 PBT (84 iBT) or an IELTS (International English Language Testing Systems) score of 7.0 or higher to be considered for admission.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship
## Academic Performance
Unsatisfactory performance may be defined as the failure to maintain a B average in graduate courses attempted after admission to the program, a grade of U, D, or F in any course, more than two grades below a B, or any other failure of a required component of one’s program of study. Any one of these, or any combination of these, may constitute the basis for the termination of a student’s graduate study in the program.
