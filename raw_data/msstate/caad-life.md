##  Overview 
One of the smaller colleges on campus, the College of Architecture, Art and Design (CAAD) prides itself on low student to faculty ratios (average 15:1) and considers itself a close-knit “community.” CAAD is continuously at the top of Mississippi State University rankings on a national student survey relating to educational experience and engagement with faculty, and all four departments are nationally [accredited](https://www.caad.msstate.edu/our-difference#accreditation).
All majors within the College of Architecture, Art and Design engage in studio-based, hands-on learning. Studio learning is a unique experience; our students have a designated studio space and have 24/7 access to work.

##  Collaboration 
The college values collaboration between majors, across campus, and with industry professionals. In their senior year, students from all of our disciplines come together to work in teams on a competitive design project. Sponsored by the Birmingham, AL-based construction firm Brasfield and Gorrie, the project winners receive scholarship money to put toward their studies!
Construction and Architecture students come together for two full semesters in our innovative Collaborative Studio to work together on actual design-build projects. Past projects include designing and building bus shelters for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, restroom facilities and golf cart shelters for the university golf course, facilities on campus, a shelter for the Boy Scouts of America, and more.

##  Field Trips 
Field trips are an important component of education for students in the College of Architecture, Art and Design. Each program offers varying levels of field trips to students. Students prepare for these trips by engaging in research and producing case studies. The time on site is divided between structured visits to important buildings, museums, and offices, and free time for students to explore on their own.
Over the years, field trip destinations have included metropolitan areas such as Atlanta, New Orleans, Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minneapolis, and Cincinnati.
In addition to longer field trips, students also participate in local and regional field trips. These trips are not only planned in conjunction with the design studios, but also complement lecture courses and may last a few hours or require an overnight stay.
##  Study Abroad 
The College of Architecture, Art, and Design at Mississippi State University believes students in our college need exposure to art, design, construction, and culture abroad. We encourage all students to take advantage of opportunities to explore academic opportunities outside of the U.S.
