The mission of the Department of Music at Mississippi State University is to contribute to the culture and education of our diverse state and region by providing quality training and opportunities through programs of teaching, research, and service. The department has the following goals:
  * Offers excellent instruction to its students, helping to produce future generations of music professionals and patrons
  * Engages in meaningful research, performance, and other creative work, positively affecting students, colleagues, and audiences throughout our community and beyond


The department's first obligation is to provide music instruction and specialized pedagogical training for state-certified elementary and secondary school music teachers. This program of instruction is intended to prepare students for exemplary entry-level teaching performance and for admission to selective graduate schools. To this end, the Department of Music provides the following:
  * Curricula and advisement that encourage students to acquire a broad, liberal education
  * A comprehensive education in the art of music
  * A background in existing music curricula, curriculum design principles, materials, and methodologies
  * Preparation in general education, theory, history, and methodology


## Master of Music Education
The Department of Music offers a Master of Music Education degree (M.M.E.). The M.M.E. is a practitioner's degree, focused on advancing the knowledge and skills of the classroom music educator in one of three specific concentrations: Choral Music, Elementary Music, or Instrumental Music. It is a 32-hour degree consisting of a 14-hour core, 8 hours in the concentration (Choral Music, Elementary Music, or Instrumental Music) and 10 hours of electives. The M.M.E. is designed to be completed in three consecutive summers at MSU, culminating in a final project evaluated by the student's M.M.E. committee. 
### Admission
To be considered for admission, the applicant must meet all MSU Graduate School admission requirements, including the following:
  * Must have earned a baccalaureate degree in Music Education or a related field
  * Preferably have an undergraduate grade point average of 3.00 for admission to the graduate program
  * Must submit three letters of recommendation, with at least two coming from individuals familiar with the applicant's academic work; letters should address the applicant's potential for successfully completing graduate studies
  * Must submit a personal statement (500-1,000 words) describing the applicant's purpose for undertaking graduate study, including professional plans and career goals


Application is made through the [Mississippi State Graduate School website](http://www.grad.msstate.edu/). In addition to the application, complete information regarding is available regarding graduate admissions and graduate academic policy. A complete application packet to the Graduate School must be received by March 1 for consideration for the following Summer term.
### Academic Performance
The Department of Music defines satisfactory performance in graduate-level coursework as a GPA of at least 3.00 on all coursework attempted with no course receiving the grade of D or lower. Students may retake the first course for which they receive the grade of D. Failure to complete any required component of the M.M.E. can result in dismissal according to Graduate School policy. 
The Department of Music follows Graduate School policy relating to academic performance. In the event a student's performance warrants dismissal from a graduate program, the Music Graduate Coordinator will petition the Graduate School to dismiss the student from the program. The student will be notified of the action by email.
