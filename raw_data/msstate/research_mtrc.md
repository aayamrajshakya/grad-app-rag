# Mississippi Transportation Research Center
Dr. Jun Wang - Director  
The Mississippi Transportation Research Center (MTRC) functions to conduct scholarly research designed to advance current transportation-related technologies in the State of Mississippi. It serves to support educational opportunities for the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) personnel, and others associated with the MDOT, to strengthening of their professional expertise, enhancement their work-related effectiveness, and advance their professional careers. MTRC also engages as a basis for information exchange with peer transportation centers and other identified organizations and corporate entities as deemed appropriate by MDOT. Finally, this center strives to develop, execute, and administer work assignments under a Master Agreement which expedites research efforts at Mississippi’s universities in support of the missions and research needs of MDOT.
When MDOT identifies a problem or subject area for a research project, the appropriate MDOT Division prepares a draft scope of work for the project. The MTRC assists in preparation of the draft as needed. With MTRC working in a supporting role, the MDOT division defines the research team at the various State Institution of Higher Learning universities to provide the needed work. The MTRC then assists the principal investigator(s) in developing a detailed scope of work, task list, progress schedule, and cost estimate for Work Assignments under the Master Agreement.
The MTRC provides credit and non-credit instructional programs as requested by the MDOT. Overall the MTRC and the Division of Academic Outreach and Continuing Education (AOCE) at Mississippi State University would provide administration of credit instructional programs. Both university and non-university personnel would provide the course instruction as needed, and the center, as supported by CEE and the Bagley College of Engineering, would maintain equipment and facilities as required for providing courses. Courses shall be selected by MDOT in coordination with the MTRC and executed through Work Assignments. A single Work Assignment may provide for more than one course.
A number of states support Transportation Research Centers. These peer centers communicate and exchange information on activities and research. The MTRC will participate in these exchanges as approved by MDOT. This exchange can take several forms and activities will be defined, approved, and reviewed by MDOT, as appropriate, on a regular basis. For example, representative of MTRC will attend technical and professional meetings deemed appropriate by MDOT.
