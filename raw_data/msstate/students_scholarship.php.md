# Success Scholarship
  

Student success starts with recruitment and retention. As a land-grant institution, Mississippi State has a mission to provide access to education to all students. To enhance undergraduate achievement and program success, the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences is initiating a new type of scholarship, one which will provide incoming students continued support during their education. The Plant and Soil Sciences Success Scholarship is designed to provide a minimum of $1,000 per year for up to four years for entering freshmen or up to three years for new transfer students.
Students more engaged in their education while in school have a more meaningful educational experience which allows greater student success after graduation. We hope to achieve a 50 percent or greater four year graduation rate while decreasing student debt upon graduation. Increasing the number of freshmen returning for their sophomore year and sophomores returning to complete their degree is critical in achieving increased graduation rates. Continued financial support with expectations of student performance increases student retention while reducing the number of first-year students on academic probation. 
The Success Scholarship is designed to support students for multiple years.
Guidelines to be eligible for a Success Scholarship: 
  * Students must show financial need.
  * Incoming students must have at least a 2.5 GPA on H.S. Core or Transfer work.
  * Students must be majoring in one of the majors in PSS: Agronomy, Horticulture, or Environmental Sciences in Agricultural Systems.
  * Students must apply via the scholarship application on [myState](https://my.msstate.edu). Under the banner tab, select Financial Aid and Scholarships. The application is listed as Submit/Revise General Scholarship Application.

  * Students must complete 30 credits in their first year, preferably completing their foundational math and composition.
