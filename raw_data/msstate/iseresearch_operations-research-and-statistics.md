# Optimization and Data Informatics
The Optimization and Data Informatics Lab encourages research in the areas of logistics engineering, transportation systems, intermodal transportation, supply chain design and management, systems engineering, applied operations research, simulation, and optimization. This lab was founded in 2000, and facilitates the research of a number of ISE faculty and students.
The goals of the Optimization and Data Informatics lab are:
  * Foster close collaborations among ISE students and faculty that work in research areas related to transportation and logistics
  * Foster close collaborations of ISE students and faculty with industry and government partners
  * Promote fundamental research and develop innovative solutions for transportation and logistics related problems
  * Host the Annual Transportation Workshop of MSU
  * Host the National Center for Intermodal Transportation and Economic Competitiveness (NCITEC).
