# Food Safety
Foodborne illness affects 48 million people—one in six Americans—each year, resulting in 128,000 hospitalizations and 3,000 deaths. A career in food safety provides opportunities to make a difference in the industry and in the lives of people. Food safety professionals impact the health and well-being of millions by preventing potentially deadly pathogens from contaminating the food supply. The Food Safety concentration trains students to become experts in food safety, prevention and control of disease, and microbiology. This program also trains students for veterinary school as well as other professional schools. The Food Safety concentration is in the Food Science, Nutrition and Health Promotion major. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/life-physical-and-social-science/agricultural-and-food-scientists.htm): The median annual wage for food scientists was $62,910 in May 2017. Overall employment of food scientists is projected to grow 7 percent from 2016 to 2026, about as fast as the average for all occupations. Employment of food scientists is projected to grow as research into agricultural production methods and techniques continues.
