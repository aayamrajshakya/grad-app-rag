#  Laboratory Safety Manual 
The Laboratory Safety Manual provides overarching information to promote a safe and healthy working environment throughout diverse laboratory settings.
The high-level overview conveyed in the Laboratory Safety Manual may require supplemental hazard-specific EH&S resources and safety training along with laboratory-specific standard operating procedures (SOPs) and practical training.
