# English Language Institute
The English Language Institute exists to provide high-quality intensive English instruction enabling students to achieve their individual goals.
## High-quality English language instruction and American culture training
The English Language Institute (ELI) provides high-quality, affordable English language instruction to students, faculty, and community members from around the world who study at Mississippi State University (MSU).
ELI credit courses are available for both admitted MSU undergraduate and graduate international students. Non-credit, intensive English courses are available for non-degree seeking students who want full- or part-time courses for academic, personal, or professional reasons.
In addition, the ELI offers special programs which can be customized to meet the short-term language and culture study goals for groups or partners. As part of its cross-cultural programming, the ELI also coordinates the Conversation Partner Program, matching ELI students with members of the MSU and Starkville communities to practice English conversation skills.
