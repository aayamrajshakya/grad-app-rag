# Culinology
The Culinology® degree program integrates Food Science and Culinary Arts so that students are prepared to work in diverse areas within the food industries—from experimental research chefs and menu planners to food manufacturing, fine dining, and product development. Culinology® is an approach to food that blends culinary arts and food technology. Through the blending of these two disciplines, culinology® seeks to make food taste better—whether purchased in a supermarket or eaten in a restaurant. Culinology® also seeks to make food more consistent and safer. A primary application of culinology® is to logically translate sophisticated food concepts, such as those applied in fine dining or in a traditional ethnic cuisine, to items that are on the menus of chain restaurants or those processed for retail sale. Such chain-menu or retail product development is only possible through the astute combination of culinary arts and food science and technology. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/chefs-and-head-cooks.htm): The median annual wage for chefs and head cooks was $45,950 in May 2017. Employment of chefs and head cooks is projected to grow 10 percent from 2016 to 2026, faster than the average for all occupations. Most job opportunities for chefs and head cooks are expected to be in food services, including restaurants.
