#  Subawards
Our subcontracts team issues all outgoing agreements for funded research. An outgoing subcontract is an agreement to utilize funds originally awarded to MSU through a contract or grant for work by another entity.
In order to initiate a request for new subaward or subaward modification, please click the link to the right to enter our OSP Service Portal and select the option for new subaward or modification based on your need.
The links below contain the request forms needed for a new subaward or a subaward modification that must be completed to initiate the agreement.
One attachment below is the Subrecipient Commitment Form, which is needed to compile required information about the subcontractor. If the subcontractor is a member of the Federal Demonstration Partnership ([FDP](http://fdpclearinghouse.org/ "FDP"), which is a consortium of over 100 universities), they are not required to complete the Subrecipient Commitment Form, but should instead complete the FDP Letter of Intent.
The final attachment is the Subrecipient vs. Vendor Checklist, which is used to confirm that the relationship between MSU and the entity is correctly classified prior to entering into an agreement.
If you have any questions regarding whether your needs require a subcontract or need any additional information, please contact the subcontract team at subcontract@osp.msstate.edu.
The [Subaward Roles and Responsibilities Matrix](https://www.osp.msstate.edu/sites/www.osp.msstate.edu/files/inline-files/Subaward_RolesandResponsibilitiesMatrix_May2019.pdf "Subaward Roles and Responsibilities Matrix") outlines the expected duties of each part of the subaward process, from proposal stage through closeout.
Please contact OSP for additional information.
