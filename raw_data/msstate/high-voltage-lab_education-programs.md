# Summer School & Certificates
## Summer School
In the Summer semesters, the High Voltage Laboratory hosts training and educational courses for industrial partners interested in gaining hands-on experience with high-voltage testing and measurement techniques. Courses can be customized to satisfy individual interests (see [Training for Industry](https://www.ece.msstate.edu/high-voltage-lab/training-for-industry/)).
## Metering School
[42ⁿᵈ Annual Electric Power and Metering School](https://msumeterschool.org/)
This school provides an opportunity for the electric utility community to gather, learn and discuss metering, testing, apparatus and relaying, and industry trends. The school is open to anyone interested and involved in these areas. The modules are tailored to instruct utility professionals at all levels of experience.
## Industry Short Courses
The High Voltage Laboratory is committed to supporting the electrical industry. We can help with orientating new recruits, brushing up on theory, and providing hands-on experience with high voltage phenomena. Contact us (hvl,ece
