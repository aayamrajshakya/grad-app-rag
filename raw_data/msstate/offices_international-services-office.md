Immigration and support services to international students and scholars.
## Our Mission
The International Services Office (ISO) assists international students and scholars on campus with immigration counseling, document issuance, and campus related services. Serving as the liaison between the university and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, ISO ensures compliance with federal regulations regarding international student/scholar immigration documents and responsibilities, including regular immigration orientation sessions, employment and status maintenance advising, and government reporting. The office also arranges accommodations, transportation, and initial visa documents for visiting scholars. Faculty and staff benefit from international travel assistance offered by the unit, including counseling for visa application and logistical needs. ISO also oversees the university risk-management system for international travelers.
