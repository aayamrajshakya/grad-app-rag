## Professional Requirements and Certificates
Alignment with National and International Standards for Meteorologists
The World Meteorological Organization and the National Weather Service have specific educational requirements for aviation forecasters or meteorologists. Not all weather careers will require the same exact courses, so feel free to discuss your career plans with an advisor before beginning any of our programs.
A degree in meteorology or a related natural science may also be necessary to gain employment in a meteorological career (this will depend on employer). Additional math and science courses will most likely be required for employment. All the AMF courses can be applied toward our undergraduate degree program in Geosciences, which is considered a related natural science field. Our full BS and MS degree programs (e.g. BOMP or AMP) can be modified or tailored to meet these requirements.
[Full Requirements](https://www.online.msstate.edu/amf/professionalrequirements)
## Certificate Request
Students who have completed the 33-hour Aeronautical Meteorology Forecaster (AMF) certificate program must submit the form below to request their certificate. Once requested, we will verify that you have met all program requirements and request that your AMF certificate be printed. Please allow 2 - 3 weeks for your certificate to arrive at the mailing address you provide below.
