#  Department of Clinical Sciences and Animal Health Center
Faculty members have specialty training and represent the following disciplines: anesthesiology, clinical pharmacology, dentistry, dermatology, neurology, oncology, ophthalmology, primary care, radiology, shelter medicine/epidemiology, small animal surgery, and small animal internal medicine. Our faculty members teach veterinary students these disciplines throughout the curriculum. Veterinarians in our department hold appointments in the MSU CVM Animal Health Center (AHC) where they provide clinical services to animal owners and referring veterinarians. The College’s third- and fourth-year veterinary students spend much of their time in the AHC, working alongside clinicians, interns and residents, refining the clinical training they started in the second year of the professional program.
