##  Ancient Greek and Latin   

The Classics section is dedicated to the study of the cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world, focusing especially on the languages, literature, history, and cultures of ancient Greece and Rome. The field is inherently interdisciplinary, meaning that in our courses you will explore not only the ancient Greek and Latin languages but also the history, art, archaeology, and literature of the Greek and Roman world, broadly conceived. This means that as part of your degree you might also take courses through the Department of Anthropology and Middle Eastern Cultures and the Department of Philosophy and Religion, in addition to those offered through the Classical and Modern Languages and Literatures Department.

##  French   

French is one of the most important languages for cultural diplomacy, and is one of the official languages of the United Nations. Given that it is spoken in many countries all across the globe, a solid command of French is a requirement for many positions that are linked to the humanistic initiatives of the United Nations.

We emphasize the student production of language in all of our courses, especially starting in German I and in courses focusing on language acquisition. We use several methods, but principally use a communicative method to create a German-language community at the appropriate level.
