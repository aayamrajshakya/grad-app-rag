# Ask an Expert
The IGBB's three [Research Leads](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/leads.php) (specializing in genomics, proteomics, and computational biology, respectively) are happy to meet with you to discuss your research and ways you can reach your scientific goals. Whether you are a pro or a complete novice in high-throughput molecular research, the IGBB Research Leads will help you chart a course towards success. Mississippi State faculty and staff can consult with IGBB Research Leads for free thanks to financial support from the [Mississippi Agricultural & Forestry Experiment Station (MAFES)](http://www.mafes.msstate.edu/) and the [College of Veterinary Medicine](http://www.cvm.msstate.edu/). To make an appointment to consult with an IGBB Research Lead, contact that individual by phone or email ([click here](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/leads.php) for contact information).
Of course, the [IGBB Director](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/admin.php) is available to provide advice and answer questions as well. His e-mail and phone information are available on the [Personnel](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/personnel.php) page.
