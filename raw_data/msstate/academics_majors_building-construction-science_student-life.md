#  Life as a BCS Student 
Studio learning is a unique experience, and the Mississippi State University Department of Building Construction Science provides a supportive environment for personal growth and professional development. 
One big advantage of studio learning is it allows for more students to have more one-on-one time with professors.
Mississippi State building construction science students have access to a variety of specialized facilities and tools within Howell Building and neighboring Giles Hall to help them succeed in their studies: printing and plotting labs, the Bob and Kathy Luke Library (college-specific material), a woodworking shop, a 3-D printer, a CNC router, and more.

## Field Trips and Site Visits
Students in the Department of Building Construction Science travel to different metropolitan locations each year to get exposure to art, design, and construction in these areas. 
Throughout the year, various studios also participate in closer site visits to conduct research relating to their specific studio projects.
