# Biomedical Engineering
Our Biomedical Engineering (BME) program helps students prepare for careers in which they apply engineering principles to biomedical engineering and systems. We have a solid base of traditional engineering courses mixed with exposure in chemistry/biochemistry and the biological sciences. The electives in the BME program allow the student to focus in biomaterials, sensors and instrumentation, or premedical studies. Many of our BME students choose to pursue further education in professional and graduate schools after finishing at Mississippi State. We advise students interested in biomedical engineering to consider attending graduate school in order to be more competitive in the job market.
