## Research and Development of Cuban Bulrush Management
#### Overview
Cuban bulrush is actively invading many multi-use lakes, reservoirs, and flowing waters across the southeastern United States. These waterbodies are vital for providing drinking water, hydroelectric power, commercial and military navigation, food sources, and recreational opportunities that enhance quality of life. The dense growth of Cuban bulrush crowds out more desirable aquatic plants, disrupting the aquatic food web and threatening economically important fish species. Over the past 20 years, Cuban bulrush has become increasingly widespread, drawing growing concern from resource managers. However, limited research on effective control strategies has made it difficult for managers to respond efficiently. This ongoing research addresses this research gap by advancing understanding of the Cuban bulrush life cycle and working to develop control methods to help resource managers protect vital ecosystems from this invasive aquatic species.
