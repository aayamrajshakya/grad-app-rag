### Rheometer
Rheometer ARES-G2  
  
Rheology is the study of flow and deformation of materials that are under the influence of an external stress or force. Rheology measurements are used to ensure successful material processing, optimize produce performance, develop novel materials, and obtain insight into complex microstructures. Rheometers measure flow and deformation, including viscosity and modulus, and extend beyond traditional viscometers to capture complex fluid behaviors like shear thinning and thixotropy.   
  
The ARES-G2 rheometer uses separate motor and transducer technology to provide high accuracy across various testing conditions, improving material processability and end-use performance. It also includes advanced techniques such as Large Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (LAOS) and Fourier Transform Rheology, making it a versatile tool for research in both fundamental and applied sciences.
