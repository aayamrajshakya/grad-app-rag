If you are a computer nerd but also love biology, bioinformatics may be the best path. A strong grasp of mathematics is essential in this concentration. Bioinformatics is fundamentally about the application of computer-based approaches to the understanding of biological processes. Today's technology has given us high-capacity analysis of genes and proteins which make it necessary to integrate informatics when solving biological problems. 
> [O*Net Online](https://www.onetonline.org/link/custom/19-1029.01): Bioinformatics scientists conduct research using bioinformatics theory and methods in areas such as pharmaceuticals, medical technology, biotechnology, computational biology, proteomics, computer information science, biology and medical informatics. May design databases and develop algorithms for processing and analyzing genomic information, or other biological information. The median annual wage for bioinformatics is $85,290. Employment of bioinformaticians is projected to grow 1 to 2 percent from 2019 to 2029.

## Internships
Internships and/or professional experience prepares students for future careers in Food Science. A significant percentage of employers prefer students with work experience outside of a college environment to students with no experience, according to new data released by the Chronicle of Higher Education. Students should check with the [MSU Career Center](https://www.career.msstate.edu/) or the program coordinator for internship opportunities.

## Scholarships
Students may apply for university, college and departmental scholarships through one application. You can find the scholarship application once you login to [myState](https://my.msstate.edu/cp/home/displaylogin). Under the banner tab, select Financial Aid and Scholarships. The application is listed as Submit/Revise General Scholarship Application.

## Organizations
The Department of Biochemistry, Nutrition and Health Promotion encourages its students to take advantage of the many experiences offered by the departmental student organizations and teams. Clubs are a great way to develop leadership skills and to learn about the various food industries. Learn more about [organizations](https://www.cals.msstate.edu/students/organizations.php) in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
