Future Engineers living in South Mississippi, South Alabama, and Louisiana now have an affordable option for earning a world-renowned education close to home. The Bagley College of Engineering at Mississippi State University is now offering three Bachelor of Science degrees in Gautier, Mississippi.
Students may complete up to 64 hours of coursework at any community college or other institution of their choice before enrolling in the electrical, mechanical, or industrial and systems engineering programs in the Engineering on the Coast (EoC) program at MSU. Completion of the EoC program results in a Bachelor of Science degree from Mississippi State University. The classes will be offered in the Mississippi State facilities at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College Gautier. The Coast campus houses five full time professors and offers specialized electives through remote learning opportunities.

Financial Aid
Contact the Financial Aid office at MGCCC about the process of applying for Financial Aid if you will be enrolled at MSU and MGCCC during the same semester.
Scholarships
Students are encouraged to apply for full admission to MSU upon completion of 48 hours at their local community college or four-year institution. This will allow students to be considered for community college transfer scholarships and will ensure their financial aid resides with MSU at that time as well.
Non-Resident Fee Waiver for South Alabama Counties
Mississippi State University-Engineering on the Coast received approval in 2016 from the Institutions of Higher Learning to waive nonresident charges for Alabama residents in these four Alabama counties; Baldwin, Escambia, Mobile, and Washington.

## FAQ
Will I need to go to the Starkville campus?
In this program, students can receive a Mississippi State University Bagley College of Engineering degree without going to Starkville. A student may decide to go for a semester or study at the main campus, but that is a personal choice.
Will there be distance education classes? 
In this program there will be a mixture of face-to-face and distance instruction. Students will be able to sit in a classroom at MGCCC and synchronously interact with a Mississippi State faculty member and students while they are in class.
What about co-ops or internships?
Co-ops and internships are available to students in the Engineering programs on the coast. Coast students will have access to all services by the MSU Career Services office either on the coast or on the Starkville campus. For those who wish to perform a co-op in the local area, several companies in South Mississippi such as Chevron, Hol Mac/Huber, Mississippi Power, and SABIC have provided opportunities to students in the past. Students are also eligible to the full range of co-op opportunities offered across the nation as well.
Do I need a computer?
Mississippi State University requires all engineering students to own a laptop.  
[Bagley Computer Requirements](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/computer/)
What about computer software?
Students will be required to have certain computer software. Some programs can be downloaded for free or purchased at a discount by Mississippi State students as we have certain software licenses. Students will receive information on software needs in their courses.
