## H. H. Leveck Animal Research Center
The H. H. Leveck Animal Research Center (referred to as South Farm by MSU personnel and alumni) provides a very important land resource which supports departmental teaching and various research activities associated with Animal Science curriculum. It provides the students of Animal and Dairy Sciences with hands-on learning opportunities in modern techniques in animal agriculture along with practical work experiences. Students gain insights into many technical challenges associated with the livestock and equine industries. In addition to extensive livestock facilities, the South Farm is home to a 120’ by 150’ covered equestrian riding arena constructed in 2021.

## Experiment Stations
The [E. G. (Gene) Morrison Brown Loam Branch Experiment Station](http://mafes.msstate.edu/branches/central.php?location=brownloam), located near Raymond in Hinds County, is a 1,730-acre experiment station within the Central Mississippi Research and Extension Center. Research is conducted at the station on development of replacement beef females to enhance efficiency of beef production systems. Efforts are underway to evaluate stocking density and management considerations for beef heifers reared in drylots. 
The [Prairie Research Unit](http://mafes.msstate.edu/branches/north.php?location=prairie), located in Monroe County on the Black belt Prairie soils of northeast Mississippi, is a 2,456-acre experiment station within the North Mississippi Research and Extension Center. Research is conducted at the station on nutritional and management strategies to optimize beef production efficiency. Current research efforts include evaluating the impacts of cover cropping system on grain yield, soil health, forage production and animal performance. Efforts are underway to determine the impact of management decisions during the cow-calf, backgrounding, and feedlot phases of beef production on bovine respiratory disease morbidity and mortality risks. Validation of technology to monitor supplement intake of grazing cattle is underway. Research is in progress to assess the use of Doppler ultrasonography and blood markers to improve early pregnancy diagnosis and assess embryo viability, as well as optimization of estrus synchronization. The Prairie Research Unit is home to a state-of-the-art GrowSafe feeding facility which is used to monitor individual animal intake. This facility is used to conduct research on performance, health, and physiological responses of high-risk beef calves supplemented with various sources of trace minerals. The station regularly hosts field days to share research results with agricultural producers and growers. 
The [White Sands Research Unit](http://mafes.msstate.edu/branches/coastal.php?location=whitesands), located near Poplarville in Pearl River County, is a 440-acre experiment station within the Coastal Mississippi Research and Extension Center. Research is conducted at the station on stocker cattle production and nutritional strategies to increase cattle productivity.
