#  Refunds of Tuition and Fees
## Refund for Dropping
A student who reduce his or her course load during a semester to a level which results in a reduction in tuition and fees may receive a 100 percent refund for the courses dropped until the 5th day of classes. After the 5th class day, no refunds are made for individual courses dropped.  
Drops for all summer terms are refunded at 100 percent during the first class day. After the first class day, no refunds are made for individual courses dropped.
## Unpaid Balances from Previous Semesters
Any outstanding and past due amounts owed to the University must be paid in full before a student may register for additional courses. All payments received on student accounts will be applied to charges in the same order in which the charges were incurred. A student who has a hold on his/her record because of an overdue account may not receive a transcript or a diploma until the account is cleared.  
Student Activities - All students by payment of tuition and required fees are eligible for use of facilities, participation in intramural sports, admission to intercollegiate athletic events, the student newspaper, student health services and other benefits.
## Billing
Billing information is generated by the 15th of each month and monthly email statements are sent out to the Official MSU Email Address (or the link provided by the student) and the statement is available via the University's myState portal at <https://my.msstate.edu>. All account information is continuously available in the OnCampus Portal under student account detail. It is the responsibility of the student to maintain current email addresses in order for the statement to reach the proper mailbox.
## Refund for Withdrawal from the University
Tuition and most fees may be refunded according to the schedule on the Mississippi State University Academic Calendar to students who formally withdraw from the University. Visit <https://www.registrar.msstate.edu/policies/> for this information.
The administrative authorities of the University will withhold the credits and readmission of any student who fails to pay all of his/her financial obligations to the University by the end of each semester and/or at the time of withdrawal.
A student's records may be cleared and credits released when the indebtedness is paid in full. The respective University department or agency will notify the University Registrar when the indebtedness has been paid.
