# Books and Supplies
Mississippi State University leases its bookstore to Barnes & Noble to provide textbooks and related supplies to the students, faculty, and staff. As a benefit of this arrangement, a percentage of the sales is returned to the University each year which is used for, among other items, scholarships, faculty increases, and departmental support. The bookstore’s retail areas also include clothing, gifts, electronics, and trade books and offers in excess of 20,000 general reading and reference titles. The store features a Starbucks Café and is located at Cullis Wade Depot. For detailed information visit their [website](http://msstate.bncollege.com/).
