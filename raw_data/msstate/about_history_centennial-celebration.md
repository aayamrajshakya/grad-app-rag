#  Our Centennial Celebration 
Mississippi State University’s College of Business commemorated its 100th anniversary in 2015, with a year-long celebration beginning in January. Founded on October 15, 1915, the College of Business is the oldest college of business in the state of Mississippi and one of the oldest in the South. Over the last century, the College of Business at Mississippi State University has produced more than 33,000 graduates—from all 50 states and 150 countries—each one an important part of our rich history.
The COB Centennial Anniversary Celebration provided us with a wonderful opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of COB students and increase the professional reputation and visibility of the College and MSU. The College of Business has been committed to educating tomorrow’s leaders while promoting economic development throughout the state and nation through research and outreach for more than 100 years.
