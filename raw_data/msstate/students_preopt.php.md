# Pre-Optometry
The pre-optometry concentration will provide you the necessary tools to take the Optometry Admissions test and perform well in Optometry school. Optometrists are concerned with all aspects of the eye—the promotion of eye health and safety, vision care, and basic examinations of the internal and external parts of the eye. Expanding technology is creating new and exciting opportunities for optometrists. 
> [Occupational Outlook Handbook](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/healthcare/optometrists.htm): Optometrists examine the eyes and other parts of the visual system. They also diagnose and treat visual problems and manage diseases, injuries, and other disorders of the eyes. They prescribe eyeglasses or contact lenses as needed. Optometrists must complete a Doctor of Optometry (O.D.) degree program and obtain a license to practice in a particular state. O.D. programs take 4 years to complete, and most students have a bachelor’s degree before entering such a program. The median annual wage for optometrists was $118,050 in May 2020. Employment of optometrists is projected to grow 4 percent from 2019 to 2029.
