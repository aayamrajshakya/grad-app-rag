## Master of Science - Thesis Option
The Master's of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a weed science concentration is a research degree program. The 30-hour curriculum includes an exit seminar to describe the thesis research, a graduate-level statistics course, a minimum of 12 hours of 8000-level course credits, and a thesis defense.

## Master of Science - Non-Thesis Option
The Master's of Science degree in Plant and Soil Sciences with a weed science concentration is a research degree program. The 30-hour curriculum includes an exit seminar to describe the thesis research, a graduate-level statistics course, a minimum of 15 hours of 8000-level course credits, a research paper, and comprehensive examination.

## Research
Scientists in the Department of Plant and Soil Sciences conduct numerous research projects to manage weeds in agricultural systems to minimize the loss of production yields. Graduate research assistantships may be available, dependent on funding. Contact one of our scientists to determine if assistantships are available.
