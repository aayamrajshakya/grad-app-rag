# Pi Sigma Alpha
Membership in Pi Sigma Alpha is open to juniors, seniors, and graduate students currently enrolled in programs of political science in institutions where chapters are located. Undergraduates must meet the following criteria: They must be at least juniors who have completed at least ten semester-credits (or 15 quarter-credits if their institution is on the quarter system) of work in political science including at least one upper-division course, with an average grade of 3.0 or higher in those courses. Graduate students must have completed nine graduate credits in political science with no grade lower than a 3.0. Undergraduate coursework does not count toward graduate student eligibility, and graduate students must be pursuing a degree in political science to qualify for membership.
Our department's Theta Beta chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha—the national honor society for political science—honors our most outstanding undergraduate students. Each year we induct our students into the society at an impressive luncheon, where a distinguished public servant speaks.
