# Human Centered Computing
Human beings, whether as individuals, teams, organizations, or societies, play an integral role in all stages of the creation and use of computational systems. Human Centered Computing (HCC) research explores creative ideas, novel theories, and innovative technologies that advance our understanding of the complex and increasingly coupled relationships between people and computing. At MSU, we study human-centered computing in the context of software engineering, human-robot and human-computer interaction, visualization and visual analytics, and virtual/augmented environments.
