# Graduate Handbook
The CSE Graduate Handbook details policies for all graduate programs within the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. This polices do not supersede those of the University; students and faculty are responsible for knowing the relevant policies from the [Graduate Catalog](http://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/). Each student is responsible for understanding and completing all requirements established for his or her degree by the University, college, and department. A student’s advisor may not assume that responsibility. Any substitution, waiver, or exemption from established degree requirements may be accomplished only with the approval of the appropriate faculty, Academic Dean, and Dean of the Graduate School.
