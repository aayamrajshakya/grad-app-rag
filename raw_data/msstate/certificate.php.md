# Computational Biology Certificate Program
The IGBB is pleased to be a supporter of MS State's Computational Biology Certificate Program[Bagley College of Engineering](http://www.engr.msstate.edu/) and the [College of Agriculture & Life Sciences](http://www.cals.msstate.edu/) upon a candidate's successful completion of the requirements of the program. Completion of the certificate program will be indicated on the student’s transcript. This program requires that the student complete a total of five courses that have been approved by the [Computational Biology Advisory Board](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/certificate.php#board). 
  * All students must complete the capstone course, CSE 4623/CSE 6623 Computational Biology. 
  * Students in the life sciences must also complete CSE 4613/6613 Bio-computing. 
  * Students in computer science, computer engineering, and biological engineering must complete BCH 4113/BCH 6113 Essentials of Molecular Genetics. 
  * Students must complete at least three additional relevant courses (for a minimum of nine hours) chosen from computational or life sciences fields. The courses in the list below are all acceptable. In addition, many relevant courses are often taught as special topics courses in a variety of departments. A student must obtain approval for all special topics courses before enrolling. 


Up to three hours of appropriate Directed Individual Study may be applied toward the degree. The student should supply a synopsis of the individual study course. At least 4 of the 5 courses including the capstone course CSE 4623/6623 must be completed at MS State. Only undergraduate courses completed with a grade of C or better or graduate courses completed with a grade of B or better are acceptable.

ABSTRACT  
The mimetic butterflies Heliconius erato and Heliconius melpomene have undergone parallel radiations to form a near-identical patchwork of over 20 different wing-pattern races across the Neotropics. Previous molecular phylogenetic work on these radiations has suggested that similar but geographically disjunct color patterns arose multiple times independently in each species. The neutral markers used in these studies, however, can move freely across color pattern boundaries, and therefore might not represent the history of the adaptive traits as accurately as markers linked to color pattern genes. To assess the evolutionary histories across different loci, we compared relationships among races within H. erato and within H. melpomene using a series of unlinked genes, genes linked to color pattern loci, and optix, a gene recently shown to control red color-pattern variation. We found that although unlinked genes partition populations by geographic region, optix had a different history, structuring lineages by red color patterns and supporting a single origin of red-rayed patterns within each species. Genes closely linked (80-250 kb) to optix exhibited only weak associations with color pattern. This study empirically demonstrates the necessity of examining phenotype-determining genomic regions to understand the history of adaptive change in rapidly radiating lineages. With these refined relationships, we resolve a long-standing debate about the origins of the races within each species, supporting the hypothesis that the red-rayed Amazonian pattern evolved recently and expanded, causing disjunctions of more ancestral patterns.
