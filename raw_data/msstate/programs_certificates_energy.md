# Energy Certificate/Endorsement
## Contact Information
Dr. Masoud Karimi at karimi@ece.msstate.edu  
Dr. Morgan Green at green@me.msstate.edu
[Energy Certificate Application](https://www.bagley.msstate.edu/wp-content/uploads/Energy-Certificate-Application.pdf "Energy Certificate Application") - Each student who wishes to participate in the program must complete the application and submit it to the committee (listed above).
## Program Information
The Energy Certificate is open to undergraduate and graduate students in good standing at MSU.
This program has been designed for engineering students who plan to pursue a career in energy related fields. The Energy Certificate utilizes courses in most MSU engineering programs plus a required course in alternate energy sources. Students who successfully complete the Energy Certificate will have acquired significant energy engineering expertise in their related engineering disciplines as well as an interdisciplinary overview of energy and sustainable energy concepts.
Upon completion of the Energy Certificate, students should have achieved the following student learning outcomes:
  * Demonstrated an awareness and broadened perspective of energy issues.
  * Developed a more in-depth technical understanding of an energy area(s).
  * Successfully gained knowledge of and perspective for alternate energy sources.


The Energy Certificate Committee will review the candidates’ records to determine if course and grade requirements have been met. If all requirements have been met, the committee will submit the candidates’ name to the Dean of Engineering for certification. The Energy Certificate will be awarded at the time of completing a degree from MSU for degree-seeking students and the Dean of Engineering will notify the Office of the Registrar that the candidate has completed the Energy Certificate program (international exchange students are exempt from this requirement).
## Requirements
To meet the requirements for the Energy Certificate, a student must complete with a grade of “C” or better at least 15 hours of courses as designated in the Level I, Level II, and Level III categories listed below. Two of the Level I, II, or III courses must be above the degree requirements of the student.
