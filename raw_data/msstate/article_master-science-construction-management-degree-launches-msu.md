STARKVILLE, Miss.—A new Master of Science in Construction Management degree at Mississippi State will further prepare students for leadership roles in today’s construction industry.
Recently approved by the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning and housed in the MSU Department of Building Construction Science, the program’s master’s degree students can opt for one of two tracks—a research or professional track tailored to the diverse needs of professionals in the architecture, engineering and construction sectors.
The new program is accepting students for the upcoming spring 2026 semester and courses can be completed via online learning or in-person classes in Starkville. Applications can be completed through the MSU Graduate School and are available online at [www.grad.msstate.edu](https://www.online.msstate.edu/article/www.grad.msstate.edu).
One of two pathways for Mississippi State’s new Master of Science in Construction Management degree, the research track will explore emerging technologies, and students will have access to various labs, including the College of Architecture, Art and Design’s Simulation and Interactive Visualization Applications Lab, where student researchers explore virtual and augmented reality for problem-solving across various disciplines.

Interim Vice Provost Angi Elsea Bourgeois, who served as dean of the College of Architecture, Art and Design since 2018, said she is extremely proud of the faculty and leadership who opened new pathways for those looking to participate in the construction profession’s growth.
“Drawing on the strengths of the existing undergraduate program, the new Master of Science in Construction Management creates exciting new opportunities for students interested in this booming sector of the economy,” said Bourgeois, who also serves as interim dean of the Graduate School.
Saeed Rokooei, associate professor and graduate program coordinator, said the curriculum was uniquely developed in close collaboration with the Department of Building Construction Science’s Industry Advisory Board, a group comprised of leading construction professionals and alumni. This collaboration helped establish courses that reflect the latest trends in technology, data analysis and project management to meet evolving industry needs.
“The close working relationship between our faculty and industry professionals ensures that students gain firsthand insight into current and future industry demands, preparing them for real-world challenges and opportunities,” Rokooei said. “Our interdisciplinary approach, supported by strong industry partnerships, equips graduates with advanced technical knowledge and managerial skills, giving them a distinct advantage in the job market and empowering them to become leaders in the field.”
