# Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) Program in Educational Psychology
## Overview
Educational psychology is the science of learners and learning and draws upon rigorous research to apply psychological principles to educational issues. Educational psychologists are interested in understanding the factors that affect student learning, engagement, and motivation, and often consider a range of factors such as biology, individual differences, development, and social and contextual factors. Educational psychology also involves learning the scientific methods that apply to our field, including tests and measurements, statistics, and research methodology. Thus, the major core courses are designed to help you learn about these topics and methods for gaining knowledge in the field.
Our graduate programs are designed to prepare individuals for employment in research, teaching, and service settings. The coursework includes topics such as development, cognition, motivational and social factors, individual differences, measurement, statistics, and research. The Ph.D. degree in Educational Psychology with a concentration in General Educational Psychology requires a minimum of 91 hours of coursework beyond the baccalaureate degree.
