## State Data Clearinghouse
For over a decade, NSPARC has leveraged its academic and technical expertise to operate and maintain the State of Mississippi’s Statewide Longitudinal Data System (SLDS) as the designated State Data Clearinghouse.
Leveraging our extensive expertise, we conduct high-quality research using SLDS data to generate valuable insights that inform policymaking and improve our understanding of complex economic and workforce development processes. This includes research on talent acquisition and retention, skill development and career technical education, aligning higher education with workforce needs, economic growth, workforce participation, program outcomes and return on investment, and the relationship between career pathways and wage growth.
