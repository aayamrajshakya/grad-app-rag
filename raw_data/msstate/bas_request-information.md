## How does it work? It's simple!
Looking for a condensed, accelerated pathway to earn a bachelor’s degree? Our Bachelor of Applied Science can help, whether you’re a community college student considering your next step or a working professional looking to move to the next rung on the career ladder. Once you complete your Applied Associate degree through an accredited community college, you may transfer up to 60 hours of community college coursework to MSU (15 hours of general education core and 45 hours of technical credit).

#### Who should pursue this degree?
The B.A.S. degree was created as a pathway for students who have completed an associate degree in Applied Science. It will allow you to utilize the most previously earned technical credit toward a bachelor’s degree.
> "Attending Mississippi State University has been an amazing experience. I had previously attended a community college and graduated several years back. I chose a career in healthcare and after several years I decided to make a change. I wanted to receive my BAS and become a teacher. My advisor, Kali Dunlap, was able to help me decide the best course of action. She was very attentive to my concerns and was able to answer any questions that I had. I enjoyed getting quick responses anytime I emailed or called. Now that I am graduating with my BAS, I have been accepted to Mississippi State's graduate school and will be getting my Master of Arts in Teaching - Special Education and I could not be happier."
