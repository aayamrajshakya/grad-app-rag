### Julie Parker
#### Professor, Human Development and Family Science
With over 35 years of experience dedicated to young children and families, Dr. Julie Parker brings a wealth of knowledge and compassion to Mississippi State University's School of Human Sciences. Holding a Ph.D in Early Childhood Special Education, a Master's in Early Intervention, and a Bachelor's in Child and Family Studies with an emphasis in Child Life, Parker's career is grounded in a deep commitment to supporting children's growth in diverse and often challenging environments.
As a professor in Human Development and Family Science and a Certified Child Life Specialist, Dr. Parker's research and teaching are informed by her extensive background in Child Life and Early Intervention. Currently, she serves as a Co-Principal Investigator on a funded project developing early childhood curriculum tailored to the needs of young children growing and learning in Mississippi communities. Her work has also included leading and collaborating on NIH and state-funded projects focused on preservice training for early intervention professionals and promoting the health and well-being of children and families.
Parker's dedication to service extends beyond the university. She actively volunteers in her community and contributes to programming for a local nonprofit serving children and families, embodying her commitment to making a real difference both inside and outside the classroom.
Her outstanding contributions have been recognized through numerous awards, including the Division of Agriculture, Forestry and Veterinary Medicine's Superior Faculty Service Award (2024), College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) Faculty Service Award (2023), the Ernst Brown Good Change Award from the Mayor's Office of Columbus (2022), the Professional Research Award from the Association of Child Life Professionals (2022), and the CALS Undergraduate Upper Division Teaching Award (2019).
Being part of Mississippi State University and the School of Human Sciences, Dr. Parker says, is both a privilege and a responsibility.
"I deeply respect the mission of the School of Human Sciences—as we feed, clothe, and care for the world," she said. "This mission reflects a commitment to meaningful, service-oriented work that improves lives and strengthens communities. I am honored to be part of a faculty and staff that care not only for individuals within our school but also extend that care outward into the community. Together, we cultivate a culture of compassion, innovation, and impact."
Through her research, teaching, and community engagement, Dr. Julie Parker continues to inspire and empower the next generation while making lasting contributions to the well-being of children and families across Mississippi.
