The College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM) at Mississippi State University provides the following graduate programs:
Master of Science in Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences (VBMS) with the following concentrations:
  * Population Medicine Non-Thesis (PMNT)
  * Veterinary Medical Research (VMRC)
  * Computational Biology (VCBC)
  * Infectious Diseases (VIDC)
  * Toxicology (TOXI)
  * Population Medicine (POPM)


Doctor of Philosophy in Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences (VBMS) with the following concentrations:
  * Veterinary Medical Research (VMRC)
  * Computational Biology (VCBC)
  * Infectious Diseases (VIDC)
  * Population Medicine (POPM)


Doctor of Philosophy in Environmental Toxicology (ENVT)
These graduate programs provide advanced educational opportunities for students in a broad range of biomedical and veterinary sciences. A non-thesis master’s option in VBMS is also offered with emphasis in food animal production medicine (i.e. dairy, beef, swine, poultry, and aquaculture). The goal of the VBMS and ENVT programs is to provide training for the next generation of scientists and educators who will be leaders in biomedical and veterinary research and education. Faculty in CVM’s Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences Department of Clinical SciencesDepartment of Pathobiology & Population Medicine
Professional Certificate in Aquatic Animal Health
The professional certificate in aquatic animal health is a 15-credit hour program designed to provide introductory training to professional DVM students and graduate veterinarians in diagnostic and clinical medicine of aquatic animal species. To complete the certificate, students must complete 9 credits of required coursework providing introductory and foundational knowledge on various aquatic animals including diagnostic and clinical externship training at a facility approved by the Aquatic Animal Health Professional  
Certificate committee. The remaining 6 credits may be earned by completing additional coursework, externships, and clinical rotations selected by the student and approved by the Aquatic Animal Health Professional Certificate committee.
