##  Message From the Dean   

Welcome to Mississippi State University's College of Education, where we are taking care of what matters!
At MSU, you will find the College of Education steeped in rich academic tradition and committed to developing change agents who will go on to make the world a more productive and better place. Our faculty and students engage in research that goes beyond the laboratory and makes a difference for individuals and their communities. We believe that research paves the way to action and prepares our students to take on the challenges of tomorrow. 
Our five academic departments and MSU-Meridian Division of Education have committed faculty and staff creating a learning environment where excellence can and will emerge. Our graduates have become renowned researchers, hold leadership positions at school districts and higher education settings, work within civil rights organizations, become published musicians, and so much more.
We not only prepare students to work in education fields, but we also prepare health professionals, scientists, counselors, musicians and ITS professionals, to name a few. Our college has more than 50 degree programs at the bachelor’s, master's, specialist and doctoral levels. The College of Education is home to the Mississippi Institute on Disabilities, America Reads – Mississippi, MSU's World Class Teaching Program, the Mississippi Migrant Education Service Center, the National Research and Training Center on Blindness and Low Vision, MSU's T.K. Martin Center for Technology and Disability, and MSU's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Clinic. Many of our centers and institutes offer a wide variety of research, professional development and volunteer opportunities.
All those within the college take great pride in knowing that we are guiding tomorrow's leaders on their journey to excellence. We are truly changing tomorrow through education today.
Sincerely,
Teresa Jayroe
