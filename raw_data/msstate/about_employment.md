###  Tenure-Track Assistant Professor (Mass Spec Proteomics)
Mississippi State University (MSU) invites applications for a tenure-track faculty position at the assistant professor level to start in the fall of 2026. Candidates with research interests in the area of mass spectrometry-based proteomics are encouraged to apply. The successful candidate will contribute to the NanoBio Immunoengineering Consortium (NIEC) at MSU. NIEC is a multi-institutional effort in Mississippi supported by the NSF E-RISE RII program. This program focuses on biomolecular interactions with novel nano- and biomaterials, and the successful candidate may be housed in the Department of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, or both. The successful candidate will have a strong record of research excellence and will be expected to develop an independent, externally funded research program. They will also contribute to graduate and undergraduate education through effective and engaging teaching in their discipline. Candidates with experience in technology development and commercialization will receive special consideration.
