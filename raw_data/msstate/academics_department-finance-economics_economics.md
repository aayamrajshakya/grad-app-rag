#  Economics
Economics is the scientific study of how people and institutions make choices concerning the use of society’s scarce resources. It is a broad social science that shares common interests with both the behavioral sciences (i.e. sociology and psychology) and the decision sciences (i.e. finance and management). The importance of economic analysis is recognized by being the only social science in which a Nobel Prize is awarded. Economics students receive training in the methods and uses of economic analysis as applied to households, businesses, and governments.

## Career Opportunities
An economics major or minor helps prepare the student for graduate professional training in business, public administration and law. The flexibility of the economics major is reflected in relatively high starting salaries and lifetime earnings of economists. Undergraduates at Mississippi State University may pursue an economics major through either the College of Business (BBA degree) or through the College of Arts and Sciences (BA degree) as described in the Mississippi State Academic Catalog.
