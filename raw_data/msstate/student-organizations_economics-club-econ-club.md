#  Economics Club (Econ Club)
The Econ Club sponsors a number of social and academic events during each semester. These events are often centered on presentations by guest speakers from on and off campus. Our guests discuss important current economic events and issues and relate textbook economics to the real world. Topics of recent Econ Club symposiums include "The Global Economy," "Adventures South of the Border - The Mexican Economy," "Yankee Economics," "The Economics of Trick-or-Treat," and "The Uruguay Round Debate." The Econ Club is also known for the great food we serve at our social hours following the presentations. In addition to hosting our regular symposiums, the Econ Club is active in promoting the economics curriculum and major here at MSU. We are involved in designing and distributing recruiting materials and brochures.
