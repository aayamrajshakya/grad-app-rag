# Helping You
Most investigators that wish to leverage the IGBB's knowledge (i.e., trained personnel), equipment, and/or infrastructure do so through one or more of the following routes. Click the links below to learn more. 
[Ask an Expert](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/askanexpert.php) - The IGBB's genomics, proteomics, and computational biology Research Leads are available to meet with you to discuss your research and ways you can reach your scientific goals. Such consulation is free, and it may help you avoid common pitfalls (e.g., having a student spend considerable time working on obtaining a precious biological sample, only to learn that the methods employed by that student rendered the sample useless for downstream analysis). To make an appointment to consult with one or more IGBB research associates, [click here](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/leads.php).  

[Proposal Partnerships](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/proposals.php) - Partnering with the IGBB has allowed numerous faculty members to overcome the scientific, technical, personnel, and organizational issues that may have prevented them from successfully obtaining extramural grant funding in the past. We can help you plan, write, and submit your grant proposals in a way that fully leverages the strengths of the IGBB and HPC² while building on your research expertise. Faculty in any department can submit a proposal through the IGBB (with or without an IGBB child account) or submit a proposal through their home department with an IGBB child account.   

[Experts for Hire](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/expertsforhire.php) - Hire an IGBB expert! Most research includes development of new/improved techniques, complex and/or risky procedures, and considerable intellectual investment/problem solving. Trying to figure out how to do new genomics, proteomics, and/or computational biology experiments or training a student or postdoc to conduct this work for you may be very expensive and frustrating. Considerable time and resources can be saved by hiring a highly-skilled IGBB expert to help you achieve your genomics, proteomics, and/or computational biology research goals.  

[Service Center](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/services.php) - Have the IGBB do standard low-risk proteomics, genomics, and computational tasks for you on a fee-per-service basis. Mississippi State University faculty/staff/students, faculty from Mississippi schools associated with our National Institutes of Health (NIH) INBRE and COBRE awards, and governmental agency collaborators are charged cost-recovery-only prices. Use our convenient [Service Center Catalog](https://www.igbb.msstate.edu/services_catalog.php) to learn about the standard services we perform & obtain pricing information. Included in the Service Center Catalog are prices for IGBB equipment use by trained scientists not directly employed by the IGBB and costs for training non-IGBB personnel to use those pieces of equipment available for self-service use.
