#  Beta Gamma Sigma
Beta Gamma Sigma is an honorary organization available only through Colleges of Business that are accredited through the International Association for Management Education. The main goal of the organization is for faculty to honor students with the highest academic achievements.
Membership in Beta Gamma Sigma is the highest honor a student of business can receive — the business equivalent of Phi Kappa Phi and Phi Beta Kappa. Only the top 10 percent of the junior and senior class and 20 percent of the master’s students are selected for membership.
  * Corporate recruiters actively seek individuals who have attained membership in Beta Gamma Sigma. Long after graduation, membership will enhance career development.


  * Programs such as the BetaLink On-Line CommunityAlumni Network
