Mississippi State University student Jacob Uithoven loves acting, singing and performing. When he was cast as the lead, he said he was “super excited.”
“I’ve never played a lead role before, so this is a whole new experience for me,” he said.
The 22-year-old from Belden, is taking center stage as Wilbur in Theatre MSU’s upcoming production of “Charlotte’s Web,” premiering Friday [Sept. 27].
For Uithoven, who began his journey at MSU in 2022, the opportunity to portray Wilbur has been a thrilling adventure, with rehearsals proving to be the most enjoyable part of the process, he said.
Although this is his first lead role, Uithoven is no stranger to the stage—having participated in several other Theatre MSU productions—and his time at MSU has only deepened his passion for theater.
“It’s helped me be more confident, more productive and more prepared,” he said.
These new skills have not only benefited him on stage but also positively impacted his academic and social life at MSU.
“Friendship is one of the most important themes ever,” he said. “I’ve made lots of new friends here,” said Uithoven, who added his time at MSU has been enriched by the friendships he’s made on campus and specifically through involvement with Theatre MSU.
Schoolchildren across the state are expected to flock to MSU to see the heartwarming production of “Charlotte’s Web,” and Uithoven said he hopes those in attendance will learn the importance of loyalty in friendship.
“Always count on and trust your closest and dearest friends,” he said.
As opening night approaches, Uithoven said he is most enthusiastic about one thing: “The audience having a fun time watching a really good show.”
Uithoven previously worked as an intern for Theatre MSU—from posting promotional materials for the productions to helping with auditions and reading line with actors prior to production casting.
Outside of the theater, he has been making the most of his time in Bulldog country. Uithoven also interns at WMSV Radio Station, gaining valuable experience he hopes will lead to a career as an actor or voice actor.
Uithoven credits MSU’s ACCESS program, which supports students with diverse learning needs, for helping him grow both personally and professionally.
“ACCESS has helped me a lot on my path to my future career,” he said.
Uithoven’s advice to other students who might be interested in participating in Theatre MSU is simple: “It would be fun! You’ll have a great time, and you might even make some new friends along the way.”
With his ACCESS program completion set for 2026, Uithoven is looking forward to continuing his journey at MSU and beyond. For now, his focus is on bringing Wilbur to life on stage—and he can’t wait for audiences to enjoy the show as much as he has enjoyed being part of it.
