## Admission Requirements
Any person admitted to the Graduate School must hold a Bachelor's degree; normally, the undergraduate degree must be awarded by an institution having regional accreditation. A prospective applicant who holds a Bachelor's Degree from an educational institution that does not have regional accreditation may request consideration from the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences prior to making an application for admission. In either case, the graduate coordinator may prescribe specific undergraduate-level courses as prerequisites for admission. The Office of the Graduate School administers admission to graduate studies.
