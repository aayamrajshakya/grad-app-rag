The Department of Industrial Technology, Instructional Design, and Community College Leadership (ITIDCCL) prepares students with marketable technology and leadership skills to pursue careers in a variety of professional settings, including K-12 schools, higher education, and an array of industry and business environments. The department offers two undergraduate bachelor’s degrees, two Master of Science degrees (Instructional Technology; Workforce Education Leadership), Master of Arts in Community College Education, Educational Specialist in Technology, and two Doctor of Philosophy degrees (Community College Leadership; Instructional Systems and Workforce Development). 
## Graduate Programs in Community College Leadership, Community College Education, and Workforce Education Leadership
Master of Arts in Teaching in Community College Education (M.A.T.)
The Master of Arts in Teaching in Community College Education is an interdisciplinary degree program designed to prepare professionals for teaching in a community college setting. The degree requires a minimum of 18 graduate hours in the student’s teaching field (i.e., history, math, English, biology). The professional education sequence consists of 12 hours. The education courses introduce students to the philosophy and culture of the community college and prepare them to teach non-traditional and first-generation students. Sensitivity to diversity and adult learning theory is also included in the curriculum. The program is not completely online for the teaching areas of math and English since those courses are often only offered on campus.
Master of Science in Workforce Education Leadership
The Master of Science in Workforce Education Leadership is a distance learning program designed to prepare professionals for employment in workforce education in postsecondary educational institutions and social services entities, advancing the knowledge base of workforce preparation, workforce development education, and professional development. The program is offered completely online.
Doctor of Philosophy in Community College Leadership
The Ph.D. degree program in Community College Leadership is designed to prepare professionals for leadership positions in community colleges. The program consists of courses in history and philosophy of the community college, leadership and organizational theory, leading and managing a community college, and research and statistics. The program is offered completely online.
Admission Criteria for the Ph.D. in Community College Leadership
Deadline for admission is March 15 for summer and fall and October 15 for spring. To be eligible for admission to the program, the applicant must hold a master's degree from an accredited institution, meet the basic requirements specified for graduate students at Mississippi State University, demonstrate interest in the mission of community colleges, and demonstrate academic proficiency based on the following indicators:
  1. Grade point average (GPA) of 3.40 on a 4.00 scale is required for the completed master's degree and all other graduate degrees and graduate-level coursework completed.
  2. Names and contact information for three people to provide a reference
  3. An interview
  4. One year of full-time work experience in the community college setting and current employment within a community college at the time of application
  5. Curriculum vitae
  6. Statement of purpose of 500-1000 words to include reason(s) for wanting to be in the program, research interests, and career goals and aspirations
  7. Official transcripts from each college or university attended


## Graduate Programs in Instructional Technology
Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates at Mississippi State University are encouraged to apply to the Accelerated Program in ISWD. This program permits students to earn up to 9 hours of graduate-level coursework during the final year of undergraduate studies. Students take graduate-level courses and earn both undergraduate credit and graduate credit simultaneously. Upon completion of the graduate course(s), undergraduate credit is also awarded. 
Students need to consult with a potential graduate advisor or the graduate coordinator to ensure graduate credit could be applied to a program of study for the M.S. degree. Interested students should contact the graduate coordinator, and consult [Accelerated Programs](http://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/) for complete information. Graduate courses in our department are online, so there is an additional cost for online education fees.
M.S. and Ed.S, Instructional Technology
The Department of Industrial Technology, Instructional Design and Community College Leadership (ITIDCCL) offers graduate coursework leading to a master’s degree in Instructional Technology (MSIT). The master’s program requires a minimum of 33 semester credit hours, and both thesis, and non-thesis options are offered. The educational specialist degree may be earned with a major in Education and a concentration in Technology. A doctor of philosophy degree program in Instructional Systems and Workforce Development is also available.
Ph.D., Instructional Systems and Workforce Development
The Doctor of Philosophy in Instructional Systems and Workforce Development (ISWD) is focused on the intersection between learning and technology. Some potential areas of research in this program include instructional design, technology integration into educational settings, media design for learning, distance learning, organizational training and performance, and workforce development, among many other related areas. A formal program of study is developed by the student with the advice and concurrence of the student's major professor and other committee members.
A minimum of 90 semester hours of post-baccalaureate credit is necessary to meet the ISWD doctoral degree. In order for the program to reflect students' content areas in research and foundation levels, students are required to take two research and statistics courses and two foundations courses from the Department of ITIDCCL. The hours taken in these required classes will serve to meet the requirements for Research, Foundations, and Postsecondary and will not be reflective of the 24-30 hours needed to complete the Technology requirements. Two-thirds or more of the hours on the doctoral program of study, exclusive of dissertation credits, must be in 8000-9000 level courses or their equivalent. Approved 7000 Directed Individual Study courses count toward this requirement. Ordinarily no more than 6 semester hours of graduate credit earned in DIS courses or 6 semester hours of special problem courses may be included on the student's approved program of study. No more than 9 semester hours of a combination of DIS and special problem courses may be included on the student's approved program of study. Twenty hours of dissertation research, written and oral preliminary examinations, a dissertation, and an oral examination in defense of the dissertation are required.
Completion Requirements
All graduate students submitting a thesis or dissertation must attend the thesis/dissertation workshops conducted by the Library for the Department of ITIDCCL prior to the application for the written comprehensive examination. All students seeking the doctor of philosophy degree must satisfy research skills requirements before taking the written preliminary examination. 
A student applying for admission into graduate programs in Instructional Design and Workforce Development must submit the complete application packet to the Graduate School no later than:
Graduate Application Fee Applying For | Domestic Deadline | International Deadline

### Contingent Admission
A student may be admitted to departmental graduate programs with conditional requirements identified by the department (e.g., writing requirement). If a prospective student has met all admission requirements and is in the final semester of previous degree work, the student may be eligible for contingent admission. If the student is admitted contingently, s/he has to fully complete the conditional requirements no later than the third semester after admission to the program.
### Readmission Criteria
The Department of Instructional Systems and Workforce Development requires that a student who has not been enrolled for three consecutive semesters must submit a readmission application that includes:
  * Three letters of recommendation (if they are older than three years since the last application), and
  * A revised statement of purpose that:


  1. describes the purpose of reapplying
  2. discusses the applicant's career goals
  3. explains how circumstances have changed making academic improvement a realistic goal
  4. identifies the applicant's research interest (Ph.D. students only).


## Academic Performance
Unsatisfactory performance is defined as any of the following:
  * Failure to maintain a B average in graduate courses attempted after admission to the program (i.e., program and non-program courses)
  * A grade of U, D, or F in any one course
  * More than 6 credit hours of C grades
  * Failure of the preliminary/comprehensive examination
  * Unsatisfactory evaluation of a thesis or dissertation
  * Failure of the research defense
  * Any other failure of a required component of one’s program of study


Any one of these or a combination will constitute the basis for review for possible dismissal. If unsatisfactory performance is determined, the graduate coordinator, the major professor, and the dean will review the student's record and determine a course of action: immediate dismissal or the establishment of a probationary period in which corrective action must take place. It is the major professor's responsibility to ensure that any student who has performed unsatisfactorily be recommended for termination from the degree program before the beginning of the subsequent semester.
Appeal of dismissal can be made by submitting a written appeal statement to the graduate coordinator and/or department head. If the dismissal, upon the student's appeal, is upheld by the graduate coordinator and/or department head, the student can then submit a written appeal to the Dean of the College of Education. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the Dean, he/she may choose to submit a final appeal of the dismissal to the Provost.

A technology elective is any 6000, 7000, 8000 or 9000-level course with a TECH/TKT prefix that is not included in the required courses. If a student takes more than the required number of courses in research, foundations, or postsecondary, those courses will be classified as an approved free elective.
Minor courses are optional.
All department requirements must be completed, and all College of Education requirement courses   
must be completed to satisfy degree requirements prior to graduation.
The Doctor of Philosophy in Instructional Systems and Workforce Development (ISWD) is located within the College of Education and is designed to provide students with knowledge of instructional technology, research design methodologies to conduct research, foundations of education, and postsecondary education. Each student is assigned a major professor and a committee. A formal program of study is developed by the student with the advice and concurrence of the student's major professor and other committee members no later than the student's second semester of enrollment.
A minimum of 90 semester hours of post-baccalaureate credit is necessary to meet the ISWD doctoral degree. In order for the program to reflect students' content areas in research and foundation levels, students are required to take two required research and statistics courses and two required foundations courses from the Department of Instructional Systems and Workforce Development (ISWD). The hours taken in these required classes will serve to meet the requirements for Research, Foundations, and Postsecondary and will not be reflective of the 24-30 hours needed to complete the Technology requirements. Two-thirds or more of the hours on the doctoral program of study, exclusive of dissertation credits, must be in 8000-9000 level courses or their equivalent. Approved 7000 Directed Individual Study courses count toward this requirement. Ordinarily no more than 6 semester hours of graduate credit earned in DIS courses or 6 semester hours of special problem courses may be included on the student's approved program of study. No more than 9 semester hours of a combination of DIS and special problem courses may be included on the student's approved program of study. Twenty hours of dissertation research, written and oral preliminary examinations, a dissertation, and an oral examination in defense of the dissertation are required.
## Completion Requirements
All graduate students submitting a thesis or dissertation must attend the thesis/dissertation workshops conducted by the Library for the Department of Instructional Systems and Workforce Development prior to the application for the written comprehensive examination. All students seeking the doctor of philosophy degree must satisfy research skills requirements before taking the written preliminary examination.
