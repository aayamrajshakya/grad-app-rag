## Internships
**[Cooperative Education](https://www.career.msstate.edu/coop)** - Through its Cooperative Education program, Mississippi State University encourages students to receive practical on-the-job training along with their academic studies. Typically, students in this program accumulate one year of work experience in their chosen fields before graduation by alternating between studying at Mississippi State for a semester and working with a cooperating organization for a semester.
Students must complete two semesters of study and earn a minimum 2.5 grade-point average before entering the cooperative education program, and they must maintain a minimum 2.5 GPA. Generally, students begin work during the summer following their freshman year and work alternate semesters thereafter.

## Thrive in Five
With MSU's Thrive in Five accelerated degree program, scholars can earn their bachelor's and master's degrees concurrently in only five years. And by completing the required course load in less than the typical six years, they'll enter the workforce and start earning sooner. Undergraduate students who have completed at least 60 hours of coursework and have at least a 3.25 GPA may begin the process of earning their bachelor's and master's degrees at an accelerated pace today.

## Living-Learning/Theme Community
The College of Forest Resources Themed Community for natural resource majors is housed in Cresswell Hall. The community provides students an opportunity to attend the same classes, establish study groups, and network and live with like-minded students. The College of Forest Resources is a small college with career paths that provide students continuous interaction with classmates from the first day of college throughout their careers. Students in this community will find a valuable opportunity to ease the transition to college and to build relationships within the natural resource field. Students must be in the College of Forest Resources to participate in this community.
