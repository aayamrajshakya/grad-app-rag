OSP is streamlining research at MSU through the implementation of the [OSP Service Request Portal](https://msuosp.samanage.com "Service Request Portal")! All requests to OSP for proposal and award assistance should be initiated through the Service Request Portal. This portal is designed to quickly give you the information you need while providing transparency and timely updates throughout the request process.
To request a user login for the system, click “Sign up to submit and track your service requests” on the login page of the [portal](https://msuosp.samanage.com "Service Request Portal").
