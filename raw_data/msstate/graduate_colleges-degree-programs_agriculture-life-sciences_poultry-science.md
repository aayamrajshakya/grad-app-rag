The Poultry Science Department offers the following degrees:
  * Master of Science degree in Agriculture with a concentration in Poultry Science
  * Master of Agriculture in Agriculture with a concentration in Poultry Science
  * Doctor of Philosophy degree in Agricultural Sciences with a concentration in Poultry Science


The department also offers M.S. and Ph.D. programs with concentrations in the interdisciplinary programs of genetics and animal physiology. Admission requirements and detailed information for those interdisciplinary degree programs can be found listed separately under each of the individual programs.
## Accelerated Program
Highly qualified undergraduates in the Poultry Science Department at Mississippi State University are encouraged to consider applying to the Accelerated Program which permits students to earn up to 9 hours of graduate-level coursework during their final year of undergraduate studies. For complete information, see [Accelerated Programs](https://catalog.msstate.edu/graduate/colleges-degree-programs/). 
In addition to University requirements, the Department of Poultry Science also requires the following information from applicants:
  1. Three letters of recommendation
  2. Selection of a potential major professor from the departmental graduate faculty
  3. A statement of purpose that describes their academic and professional goals as well as how their prior academic and professional experiences have prepared them for the Accelerated Program and graduate study


Students interested in applying to the Accelerated Program should contact the Department's Graduate Coordinator, Dr. Kelley Wamsley, for more details. 
## Admission Criteria
Admission requirements for the M.S. in Agriculture degree with a concentration in Poultry Science are the same as those listed in the General Requirements of the Graduate School in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) except that any request for Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test scores is dependent upon the faculty member who will serve as the thesis director (major professor) but the GRE score is not a Department of Poultry Science requirement.
Admission requirements for the Ph.D. degree concentration in Poultry Science are the same as those listed in the General Requirements of the Graduate School in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) except that any request for Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test scores is dependent upon the faculty member who will serve as the dissertation director (major professor), but the GRE score is not a Department of Poultry Science requirement.
### Provisional Admission
An applicant who has not fully met the GPA requirement stipulated by the University may be admitted on a provisional basis. The provisionally-admitted student is eligible for a change to regular status after receiving a 3.00 GPA on the first 9 hours of graduate courses at Mississippi State University (with no grade lower than a C). The first 9 hours of graduate courses must be within the student's program of study. Courses with an S grade, transfer credits, or credits earned while in Unclassified status cannot be used to satisfy this requirement. If a 3.00 is not attained, the provisional student shall While in the provisional status, a student is not eligible to hold a graduate assistantship.
## Academic Performance
Satisfactory academic performance standards are the same as those for CALS, except as follows:
  * The student is allowed to make no more than two C grades in courses taken for graduate credit. 
  * The student will be recommended for dismissal if he/she receives a third C or any grade below a C. 
  * In addition, the student’s committee reserves the right to establish a “core” course or courses whereby any grade below a B in one of those courses is not accepted.
  * The student will be recommended for dismissal if he/she receives a C or any grade below a C in a core course. 
  * The student must have a final GPA of 3.00 or higher to graduate.
  * Doctoral students only:
