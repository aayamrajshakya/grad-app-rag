## AI Master's at CMU
* * *
At Heinz College, AI management is about learning to learn. 
> I think the number one thing that I personally appreciate about Heinz and CMU is the fact that they are so quick with refreshing their syllabi. As soon as generative AI came out, the next semester, Heinz had classes on Gen AI, LLMs and AI operations, which was insane because it was pretty new. For me, one key factor was getting that early advantage in learning about these technologies of the future from great faculty. These faculty have years of experience in the field and it’s been great to learn firsthand from people who are so passionate about what they do.Atharva Joshi | Heinz '23, Project Manager - AI & Data Analytics at L'Oreal
