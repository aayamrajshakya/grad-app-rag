# Tartan Scholars
The Tartan Scholars program is specifically designed to meet the unique needs of high-achieving student leaders with limited resource backgrounds.and to date we have had over 600 students join the Tartan Scholars family.
Tartan Scholars have made significant impacts on our campus since their arrival. They are leaders within their colleges, within student organizations, and within student government. Some of the perks of Tartan Scholars include gaining early and direct access to the deans, faculty, and advisors from your college, having dedicated staff and peer mentors, opportunities to gain internship and research experiences, support with navigating your academic journey, and much more! 
## Our Mission
We believe in the transformative power of the CMU experience and in the university’s responsibility to ensure all students can benefit from this great institution and achieve their full potential. In order to create this opportunity for all students, we intentionally offer academic, financial, and social supports for students from limited resource backgrounds proven to amplify their success skills, facilitate strong community and university bonds, and create a critical sense of belonging. Through data-driven, curricular and co-curricular experiences, the Tartan Scholars program designs seamless pathways for each student to explore, grow, and develop toward their future goals, ultimately impacting society in transformative ways.

"Tartan Scholars transformed my CMU experience by providing both a safety net and a springboard...When imposter syndrome made me question my place, Tartan Scholars reminded me I belonged." 
#### Laura Gallegos, 2025 Tartan Scholars Cohort
"Through Tartan Scholars, I’ve had the opportunity to be able to relate to others that come from similar backgrounds and also learn from those that are different, but regardless of our backgrounds you are able to feel welcomed and apart of the wonderful community and family that is Tartan Scholars."
