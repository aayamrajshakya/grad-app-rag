# Outside Scholarships
Outside scholarships are any scholarships not awarded by the federal or state government or the university. Examples of outside scholarships are Gates Millennium, Rotary scholarships, National Merit scholarships, etc.
Outside scholarships are used to meet unmet financial need and, if necessary, are used to offset/reduce loans and/or work-study. Institutional grants and scholarships will not be reduced due to the receipt of outside scholarships unless one of the following occurs:
  1. If the student receives federal grants or loans, these funds, in combination with any other grants/scholarships, cannot exceed the student's financial need.
  2. All outside scholarships, in combination with all aid received, cannot exceed the student's cost of attendance.
