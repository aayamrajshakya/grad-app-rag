## A Program Designed with Flexibility
  
As a working professional, you're busy. Busy with your career but also with family and personal commitments, too. We get it - and we respect your time. The part-time program was designed to be flexible, allowing you to further your education while maintaining your commitments. Here's how it works: 
**  
  
**You can attend classes in the evening or during lunchtime.
Evening classes typically run from 5:30–9:30 p.m. PT, while lunchtime sessions offer additional flexibility for your workday schedule. All required courses are scheduled so that you only need to attend class one evening or lunchtime session per week. Elective courses are offered throughout the week and can be taken at your discretion as your schedule permits.
Each class blends instructor lectures, guest speakers, discussions, and interactive activities with your peers—creating a dynamic and engaging learning experience.
**  
  
You can attend classes in person or remotely via Zoom.**  
  
If you're located near campus, you can attend synchronous class in person at the [Silicon Valley campus](https://sv.cmu.edu/). If you're not, you can attend remotely via Zoom. We've been successfully teaching the program in a hybrid format for over 20 years, so your educational experience will be seamless, regardless of your location.
This flexibility allows you to plan your work and personal schedule around class times to allow you to balance your education with your life.
**  
  
You can complete your degree in as little as two years.**   
  
To complete the degree in 2 years, you will take 24 units of coursework per semester.
However, you can take additional units to complete the program sooner, or you can stretch that timeline out to be more feasible for you, as long as you complete your degree in 7 years.
As your career, personal commitments or family grows, you can adjust your course load. And, if you need to take time off it's easy to reenter the program.

Transitioning from Design to Product
A UI/UX designer looking to transition into product, Hall enrolled, from 2500 miles away in Ohio, as a part-time remote student in the MSSM program.
"Product is that pivot point between business strategy, engineering or architecture, and design. The practice of product is one of the reasons why I went to Carnegie Mellon. The Software Management program did that really well," Hall said.
She completed the degree in August 2018 and accepted a Lead Product Manager role at Williams-Sonoma Inc., where she built out the strategic plan and vision for connected eCommerce and retail sales in the $1 billion home furniture segment. "The MSSM program taught me how to think strategically, which prepared me for Williams-Sonoma and is especially critical for my position at Dopple," Hall said.

Leveling Up
The drive to understand and solve problems has been a constant theme throughout Suterwala's life. It propelled him to enroll in the part-time M.S. in Software Management degree program while working full-time at Cisco."The MSSM degree set me up for where I'm at today. I mean, at Cisco, I thought I knew everything. I learned at CMU how much there is to learn and how to ask the right type of questions. To be humbled and to know that you can still do something if you don't know it," Suterwala said. "So even though I didn't know anything about drug discovery, I knew that it would get me closer to my mission."
Now a senior manager at Atomwise, Suterwala and his team partner with cheminformatics scientists to explore, develop, and productize various computational chemistry methods to help scientists execute hit identification, hit to lead, and lead optimization processes.
