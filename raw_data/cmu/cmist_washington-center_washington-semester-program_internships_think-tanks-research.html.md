# Think Tanks and Research
Interested in research and the inner workings of policy-making? Want to work with world-renowned scholars on a daily basis? Consider an internship at a think tank!
Think tanks create and publish research, conducted by scholars who are experts in their fields, on a variety of topics to inform policy-making. Internships at think tanks fall into two broad categories -- staffing and research. For staffing placements, you can expect to work on a communications or events team, or help with human resource functions or fundraising. Research assistant interns are usually assigned to work with a particular scholar and help exclusively with that scholars’ research and publications.
