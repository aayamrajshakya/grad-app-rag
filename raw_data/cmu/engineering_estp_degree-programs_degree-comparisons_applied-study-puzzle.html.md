# Applied Study Degree Comparisons
The two Applied Study Degrees build directly off of each of the two [Foundational Degrees](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/foundational-table.html) by integrating 3 units of career and professional development (39-699) and 3 units related to a summer internship* (distributed over two courses), for an additional six units to the total units of the appropriate Foundational Degree, with no added time to degree completion.
The two Applied Study Degrees are illustrated using puzzle graphics below, which aim to highlight how the distinct components of the degrees fit to a larger whole, and to indicate the flexibility in designing a degree that fits your individual career goals. 
* The internship is required between a full-time spring and subsequent full-time fall semester
