Overview  
This is the first course in the EST&P core mini-course sequence where masters students learn the basic workings of the systems that supply, distribute, and utilize energy. This class will consider fossil energy, nuclear energy, and renewable energy resources. The course will provide some basic thermodynamics and will cover both conventional and emerging energy conversion technologies. Specific technology examples may vary from semester to semester selected from such important topics as photovoltaics, fuel cells, carbon sequestration and biofuels.
