# BCSA Program
The Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA)
The BCSA curriculum has three main components: general education requirements, fine arts concentration requirements and computer science concentration requirements. Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and SCS. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in SCS to guide their focus in computer science.
