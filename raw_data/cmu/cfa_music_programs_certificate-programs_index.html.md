The Carnegie Mellon School of Music recognizes the importance of meeting each student’s individual career needs. While intense training in a specific studio area is the heart of every musician’s education, broadening the range of musical skills can often make a difference in developing a successful career in the profession.
For this reason, the School of Music has developed several highly acclaimed certificate programs to augment the degree-granting programs offered to its students.
