_Before planning to take any courses from any department other than Biological Sciences, please consult with the academic advisor to discuss the pre-requisite knowledge required to take those courses._
Also note: classes from other departments, including the Computational Biology Department, are subject to availability of space for MSQBB and MSQBBAS students and also have pre-requisites. Unfortunately, pre-requisites are not always listed or are occasionally incorrect in the listings, please talk to the MSQBB/MSQBBAS academic advisor before planning to take courses from any department other than Biological Sciences.
Admitted students will choose either the MSQBB or MSQBBAS program in March/April for August start date. Inter-program transfer after matriculation requires special approval from program administration.

No summer work is required. Students may work at Carnegie Mellon over the summer [per university guidelines](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-students/employment.html). Students may also use their summer for non-academic pursuits.
Students may seek summer internships. The [CMU Career & Professional Development Center](https://www.cmu.edu/career/) provides substantial support in internship applications to interested students.
Our program does not guarantee internships to any students and internships are not required. Foreign students who find a summer internship may request [Curricular Practical Training (CPT)](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-students/employment.html) authorization. Internships must be in quantitative biology and/or bioinformatics to qualify for CPT; foreign students should talk with the [Office of International Education](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-students/).
### Fall semester of year 2 (39 units):
  * 03-711 (12 units): Computational Genomics and Molecular Biology or 03-709 (12 units): Applied Cell & Molecular Biology

    * 02-719 (12 units): Genomics & Epigenetics of the Brain (subject to space & availability)
    * Up to 12 units of research credit may also be done, interested students should work with program advisors to find a lab
    * Other electives from the first Fall (above) are available, subject to any required pre-requisite knowledge and subject to availability of space. Please contact the academic advisor with questions and to discuss all courses you plan to take.


NOTE: in some rare situations, stuents starting the 3rd semester may have fewer than 36 units of credit required to graduate. Department and university policy requires that all MS student be full-time students, so they must take a minimum of 36 units per semester, so you may have to take other course that doesn't count toward your degree to maintain the 36-unit university-enrolled minimum. If you find yourself in this situation, consult with the academic advisor.
At the end of the third semester, students who have completed requirements will graduate. F1 visa holders may apply for Optional Practical Training (bottom of [this page](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-students/employment.html)), employment in the US is subject to all applicable US laws and university policies, foreign students should talk with the [Office of International Education](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/foreign-students/).
#  Additional Curriculum Notes 
## Seminars
Each semester, all students are encouraged to and attend some or all of the weekly Department of Biological Sciences Research Seminars. Graduate students are strongly urged to meet the speakers to broaden their knowledge of cutting-edge biological science and to make useful contacts; the faculty host can arrange individual or small group meetings for interested students. Students may also count up to 3 units of seminar (typically 1 semester) as depth coursework.
## Research
Research is not required, but is allowed. Certain projects funded by or related to defense research or other sensitive US government areas (as determined by the Office of the General Counsel) are NOT permitted. At this time, no research ongoing in Biological Sciences, Computational Biology, or Chemical Engineering Departments falls under such restrictions, but some research in other departments in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Machine Learning, and some other departments does. Every mentor is required to verify with the CMU General Counsel that no sensitive topics are being researched in their lab before taking a student researcher; such verification is required in all departments (even those listed above as not currently involving sensitive topics.)
Students who are interested in research for credit may take M.S. Thesis Research (03-699). The number of credits for this course will be determined by the faculty mentor. Students may take as many units of research as they want (up to 12 units per semester). However, only 12 units total may count toward depth electives. If the student plans to write an honors thesis, they may enroll in up to 12 units of M.S. Honors Thesis Research in the final semester, these 12 units may also count toward graduation. 
Students should contact faculty from biology directly to learn about available research opportunities (or talk to the academic advisor). M.S. students are not eligible for research assistantships, but students can work or do research for an hourly pay within the limitations of number of hours and pay range. Students can not get course credit and an hourly wage for the same work. 
## Internships (only available to students in MSQBB - Advanced Study)
Students who are interested in doing an optional internship in industry or at a research lab not at CMU can take 03-600, Biology Internship, for 3 units of credit.
International students who secure paid internships outside of Carnegie Mellon must register for both 03-600 and Curricular Practical Training (CPT). The Office of International Education (OIE) oversees CPT registration. Students will need the offer letter spelling out dates of employment, hours to be worked, and wages or stipend (if any).
It is advisable to contact the Assistant Department Head for Graduate Affairs during the fall semester to begin seeking and preparing for an internship (i.e. resumes, cover letters and making contacts) to improve your chances of finding an internship.
