## Cost of Study
Tuition rates are stated as fall/spring per-semester tuition. New students should factor in an approximately 5% increase per year into any budget computation.
Tuition for Academic Year 2025–2026 Year | **Tuition Per Semester** | Tuition Per Year* | Tuition Per Unit  
---|---|---|---  
2025/2026 | $30,200 | $60,400 | $839  
*There are no tuition or fees in the summer semester for a machine learning master's student who is only completing their practicum. The practicum may be paid, with income determined by the company offering the internship. Students should contact the Master's Programs Manager about the tuition implications of taking summer classes or conducting the practicum outside the summer semester.
The full-time tuition rate is charged to students taking 36 or more units in a semester. Students taking less than 36 units per semester are considered part-time and are charged per-unit at a proportional rate. Courses are typically 12 units.
Additional fees charged by the university can be found on the [Student Financial Services website](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/graduate/index.html).
Information about Student Health Insurance can be found on the [Student Health Services website](https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/).
Machine learning master's students must also provide their own laptops.
## Financial Aid
The Machine Learning Department does not provide financial aid.
Many organizations award external scholarships for Carnegie Mellon students. U.S. citizens may also finance the cost of education through government-secured Stafford Loans.
All applicants may be interested in the [Fellowships and Scholarships Office](http://www.cmu.edu/fso/). The School of Computer Science also maintains a list of [Graduate Fellowship Opportunities](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/fellowship-opportunities/) that may be of particular interest to SCS graduate students.
Students may be able to work for the university in some capacity. Employment is generally available only to students already on campus. Teaching assistantships are sometimes available to students. Generally, these assistantships are only available after the first semester and cover only a small part of the cost of tuition. Working while in the program usually extends the time required to complete the degree. (Fifth-year master's students should note that they are expected to study full-time.)
Some students are able to pay their tuition in full. This method is the most cost-effective from a long-term standpoint.
