# Overview of the ITA Test
## The ITA test is an exam that assesses a candidate's ability to communicate with learners/ people outside their field. The test consists of two parts:
  1. A conversational interview on various academic topics.
  2. A more formal explanation (roughly 5 minutes) of a topic from the candidate's field (topics are not chosen in advance). The rater will ask questions to clarify misunderstandings and to elicit additional aspects of academic fluency.


### Language Skills Assessed
  * pronunciation
  * grammar
  * the fluency to explain and define academic terms and concepts
  * the ability to understand and respond clearly to questions.


Teaching skills and knowledge of the field are NOT assessed.
### Scoring
ITA test candidates receive one of [four scores](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#score-guide "four scores").
ITA Certification Score | TOEFL Speaking Score | IELTS Speaking Score  
---|---|---  
Pass | 28 to 30 | 9  
Restricted I | 26 to 27 | 8.5  
Restricted II | 22 to 25 | 7  
Assesstment Test Option not used | Below 22 | Below 7  
### Results
Upon completion of the test, the test-taker will learn their score and will receive an email confirmation stating their score. The test taker's home department will have access to their score.

# Who Needs to have a Language Certification
Both [university policy](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/faculty/evaluation-certification-english-fluency-instructors.html "University policy on Evaluation and Certification of English Fluency for Instructors") and PA law require that all nonnative English speaking students, undergraduate as well as graduate, have their language skills assessed before working as teaching assistants who meet with students.
## Commonly Asked Questions About Language Certification
## Who is a nonnative English speaker (NNES)?
Anyone whose native language/ mother tongue is not English, regardless of citizenship or visa status. This can include: 
  * Newly arrived international students
  * Students who attended all or part of high school or college in the US
  * Students who attended English speaking schools in another country
  * Students who are nonnative speakers but live in an English speaking country, e.g., a Canadian student who is a native English speaker does not need this certification; a native French speaking Canadian does
  * Students who are speakers of another variety of English, e.g. from India, Singapore, Hong Kong


## Do US residents / citizens need a language certification?
Yes. Any student who is not a native speaker of English needs this certification, regardless of citizenship. US residency or citizenship is not a guarantee of English proficiency. 
## Do speakers of other varieties of English, e.g. students from India, Singapore, Hong Kong, need a certification?
Yes, they do. Many students in this category have strong English skills, but many do not. Using English as the primary language of instruction or coming from a country in which English is an official language is not the same thing as "native language". 
## Do graders need a certification?
Graders who work with students need to have the ITA certification.
Department defines "grading" in many ways: different skill sets are required for
  * quantitative grading only with no student contact
  * grading while also meeting with students to explain and discuss grade
  * grading that requires the ability to communicate effectively in written English,e.g., grading lab reports or journals, essays, responding to discussion boards, writing test questions.  
  
Use the chart below to determine what type of assessment would be appropriate for a specific grading job. However, be aware that the TOEFL Writing score does not give information about the ability to respond in a culturally appropriate way to students.

Type of Grading Assignment | Method to Certify Appropriate Language Skiils for Job  
---|---  
Grading that requires meeting with students to explain and discuss grade, answer questions, etc. | Language assessment required, Restricted II minimum.  
Grading that requires ability to communicate effectively in written English, e.g., grading lab reports or journals, essays, writing test questions, responding to discussion boards. | Recommend minimum TOEFL Writing score of 24 along with department assessment of the necessary skill set, including ability to respond in a culturally appropriate way to students.  
Quantitative grading only with no student contact | TOEFL Speaking score of 18 (minimum recommended for academic work at CMU).  
## What about a student who has been studying in the US for several years?
Students who have completed undergraduate and graduate work in this country may still have basic problems with speaking and listening skills. Even a student who has worked as a TA at another university may not have the language skills necessary to function as a TA at Carnegie Mellon University.
To insure a uniform policy, please insist that all nonnative speakers complete the language certification.
# ITA Language Certification for Master Students
## Students in master programs can request an ITA Certification only when they have a job offer for a specific class
### Why do master students need to find a job before requesting ITA certification?
This allows us to use our resources efficiently. Not every master student who wants to TA will find a job. One added note: given the competition for TA jobs, master students should start looking for TA positions on campus as soon as possible. 
### Do master students need an ITA certification rating before applying for a job?
No, they do not. However, students who use their TOEFL or IELTS speaking score in lieu of the ITA test can anticipate their rating in advance by referring to the [ITA Language Certification scoring guide](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#score-guide "ITA Language Certification scoring guide"). 
#  Students can satisfy the certification requirement in 1 of 2 ways 
## [TOEFL or IELTS Option](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#toefl-scores "TOEFL or IELTS Option")
### Use this option if you:
  * Have a TOEFL or IELTS Speaking score that gives you an ITA Certification score which meets your TA job requirements.

TOEFL Speaking Score | IELTS Speaking Score | ITA Certification Score  
---|---|---  
28 to 30 | 9 | Pass  
26 to 27 | 8.5 | Restricted I  
22 to 25 | 7 | Restricted II  
Below 22 | Below 7 | Cannot use TOEFL or IELTS Option  
## [ITA Test Option](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#ita-apply "ITA Test Application")
### Use this option if you:
  * ### Do not have TOEFL or IELTS
  * ### Do not have minimum TOEFL Speaking score of 22 or IELTS Speaking score of 7
  * ### Have a TOEFL or IELTS Speaking score that gives you an ITA Certification score which does not meet TA job requirements


### The test will determine your [certification rating](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#score-guide "certification rating")

## First-time Applicants
If you are requesting language certification for the first time[application](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_G_L4BH8y8eShyX7hyf9ZZvGpKajCgf2HPg-k0dpC4k105g/viewform?usp=sf_link "application").

Review the [certification policy for Masters students](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#ita-cert-masters "certification policy for Masters students") before filling out the application.
## ITA Recertification
To test for ITA recertification, students must fulfill the following two conditions: 
  1. Have a job assignment that requires a [higher score](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/ita-certification/index.html#score-guide "higher score") than what they currently have.
  2. Have completed a significant amount of the work needed to improve robust fluency; typically students require 25-35 hours of Language Support work, sometimes for several semesters, to move to a higher score. This is especially true for students who just took the test in the previous semester.
