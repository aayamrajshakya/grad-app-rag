The EST&P  EST&P - Advanced Study 
A side-by-side comparison of the Foundational Degrees are given in this Table, which highlights how the Advanced Study degree is built off the EST&P degree to its left in the number of units and semesters required, as well as in degree customizability (note the difference in required breadth electives):
Foundational Degrees
