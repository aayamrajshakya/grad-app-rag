## Bio
I aspire to become a quantitative researcher, leveraging my strong foundation in mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and programming. I enjoy uncovering patterns in financial data to inform systematic and discretionary investing, and I am especially drawn to the creativity involved in constructing alpha signals.  
  
Before discovering my passion for quant research, I worked on M&A and private equity transactions, where I gained expertise in financial analysis, equity valuation, and industry dynamics. This experience enables me to design signals grounded in both statistical relationships and economic theory, tailored to specific business models and macro environments.  
  
I would be happy to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your quantitative research efforts. If you’re looking for someone with strong technical skills, fundamental insights, and a drive to learn, I’m ready to get started.
