# Music & Technology Portfolio Requirements
Select from the drop-down headings below to read the Music & Technology requirements for your degree program.
## Undergraduate
The Bachelor of Science in Music and Technology (M&T) is a tri-college degree designed for students who would like to combine and blend their interests in music with electrical and computer engineering or with computer science rather than to pursue conventional majors and degrees in both. To be considered for the M&T program, you must apply and be admitted to the School of Music and show academic credentials that would be admissible to either the College of Engineering for Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) or the School of Computer Science (SCS).
Current students at CMU may apply for internal transfer into the Music and Technology program. Deadlines for transfer are October 1 for the following spring semester, and March 1 for the following fall semester. For more information about transferring into the program, contact Kate Ganczarz.
Choosing a Specific Track within the School of Music:
The Music and Technology curriculum is split into three concentrations or tracks: the music concentration, composition concentration, and the technical concentration. Candidates must know which track they wish to pursue prior to applying. Students who are qualified for the music or composition concentration have a significant level of training and talent either on a specific instrument or in classical voice, or have exceptional skill for original music composition. This level of talent or skill must be equal to that of the other music majors in the School of Music, as students in the music concentration perform alongside traditional music majors in ensembles, continue private lessons with master faculty, and/or write original musical works that will be performed and recorded. Students who do not play an instrument, sing or compose music at a high level, but who have significant experience with computer music, electronic devices, digital systems and other engineering aspects of music are more appropriately suited for the technical concentration. When completing the School of Music Application, M&T candidates will apply for their desired track by choosing an area of concentration in the program section of the online application.
All Music &Technology or BXA applicants must upload a portfolio containing samples of their creative work to the School of Music. The music application and portfolio are due December 1.
Portfolio contents may include:
  * Audio recordings of performances or compositions that you engineered
  * Video recordings of performances or compositions that you produced or edited
  * Software listings for programs that you have written
  * Screenshots of your software or other creative work
  * Web pages you have created


The members of the Music & Technology faculty panel will review your portfolio electronically. You may be contacted by a member of the panel should they have additional questions. 
Additionally, applicants interested in specializing in the music or composition concentrations must also complete the required admission or audition assessment for that particular area:
Instrumental Performance:
Select your instrument from the drop down menu in the online School of Music application, answer the additional questions about your training, and pay the audition fee. M&T candidates who want to specialize in instrumental performance must complete and pass a major level audition. Please read the audition requirements and instructions for your specific studio very carefully.
Vocal Performance:
Select your voice type from the drop down menu in the online School of Music application, answer the additional questions about your training, and pay the audition fee. M&T candidates who want to specialize in classical voice must complete and pass a major level audition. Please read the audition requirements and instructions very carefully.
Music Composition:
Select composition from the drop down menu in the online School of Music application, answer the additional questions, and pay the portfolio review fee. M&T candidates who want to specialize in music composition must complete and pass a major level review. Please read the requirements and instructions very carefully, as composers must submit a portfolio containing original works that meet specific criteria.
Technology Concentration:
Select technology in the drop down menu in the online School of Music application, then submit the application and portfolio materials.

The Music & Technology panel will submit the results of the portfolio review to the Office of Undergraduate Admission. If your audition or portfolio review is critiqued favorably, you will be recommended for admission to the Office of Undergraduate Admission, and the Office of Undergraduate Admission will respond by reviewing your academic credentials. 
_All music & technology candidates are required to complete a portfolio._
