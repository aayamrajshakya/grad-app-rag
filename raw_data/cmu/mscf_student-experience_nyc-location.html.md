# New York City Location
Our New York City location features two classrooms, several offices and conference rooms, a student lounge, a recreation room, a spacious lobby and welcome area for hosting events and alumni receptions.
You will have ready access to recruiting events and networking opportunities with our alumni and industry practitioners working in the heart of the Financial District. You will also enjoy many opportunities to work with faculty - each of whom teach live from the New York classrooms twice every seven weeks. During these visits, professors also host office hours and work with students on questions they may have. Social events are planned around these visits to provide one-on-one time between faculty and students. In addition, students and staff work together to arrange various social events, including dinners and happy hours. Needless to say, New York offers many opportunities for dining, recreation and entertainment!
While the cost of housing in New York is generally higher than Pittsburgh, locations off Manhattan in [Brooklyn](http://www.brooklynonline.com/), [Staten Island](http://www.silive.com/) and [Jersey City](http://www.cityofjerseycity.com/) are quite reasonable, and public transportation is excellent. Whether browsing [Craigslist](http://newyork.craigslist.org/), the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/) or [The Village Voice](http://www.villagevoice.com/), you will find plenty of options.
Come visit us in New York City – schedule your on-site visit now!
