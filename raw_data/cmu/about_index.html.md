Carnegie Mellon University CyLab is the University's security and privacy research institute. Housed in the 25,000+ sq. ft. Collaborative Innovation Center, we bring together experts from all schools across the University, encompassing the fields of engineering, computer science, public policy, information systems, business, financial information risk management, humanities, and social sciences.
CyLab researchers are often called upon by government leaders to provide expertise on security and privacy issues. [Their work in helping shape public policy](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/about/public-policy.html) related to security and privacy spans several decades.
