The committee plans social events that include both students and faculty members in order to foster relationships outside of classes and the lab. We plan events tailored to help graduate students prepare for various milestones in the Ph.D. program, act as an interface between MSE graduate students and faculty, and plan social events to encourage interaction and collaboration between students. In this regard, we ensure that our interests are voiced in MSE affairs, as well as general GSA meetings, and ensure the quality of graduate student life.
