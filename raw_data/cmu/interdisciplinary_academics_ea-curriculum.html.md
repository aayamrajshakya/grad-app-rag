#  EA Additional Major Curriculum 
Carnegie Mellon recognizes that there are STEM-minded students who want the opportunity to formally incorporate their fine arts talents with their current study in engineering. In order to accommodate students who wish to pursue an education in both areas, while retaining the full engineering curriculum, we offer an additional major that combines the strengths of the the College of Engineering (ENG) and the College of Fine Arts (CFA). The Engineering and Arts (EA) additional major is an interdisciplinary program that offers a unique group of qualified Engineering students the foundation to develop their skills and interests in an area of the fine arts and engineering.
