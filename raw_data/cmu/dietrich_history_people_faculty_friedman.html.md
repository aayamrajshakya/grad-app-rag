## Bio
Michal Friedman is the The Jack Buncher Endowed Chair in Jewish Studies. She specializes in Jewish Diasporic history, especially that of Sephardi and Spanish speaking Jewish communities, and in Spanish history and culture. Her research and teaching focus on the history of the place and interactions of ethnic and religious minorities in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas, as well as conceptions of diaspora and nationhood. Born in Israel and raised in Tel Aviv and New York City, she completed university studies in the US and Spain and received her Ph.D. in Jewish history at Columbia University. Prior to becoming a faculty member at CMU she was a postdoctoral fellow at the Herbert D. Katz Center for Advanced Judaic Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and at The Seminar in Advanced Jewish Studies at the University of Oxford.   
  
Her book manuscript, based on her doctoral dissertation [Recovering Jewish Spain: Politics, Historiography and Institutionalization of the Jewish Past in Spain (1845-1935)](https://academiccommons.columbia.edu/doi/10.7916/D87087HV), is a study of initiatives to recover the Jewish past and the legacy of “Sefarad” in modern Spain. It explores the ways this history was mobilized by Spaniards and Jews alike in efforts to construct and claim a Spanish patria, in the elaboration of diverse ideologies including Liberalism and fascism, and in neo-imperial designs aimed to expand Spain’s national borders.  
  
She is also the author of multiple book chapters and journal articles, as well as a guest editor of a forthcoming issue of [Quest: Issues in Contemporary Jewish History](http://www.quest-cdecjournal.it/about.php) and of a special forum in[ The Jewish Quarterly (JQR).](https://katz.sas.upenn.edu/resources/blog/new-issue-jewish-quarterly-review-summer-2019)  
  
Friedman is also a co-founder and member of the organizing committee of [Genealogies of Sepharad](https://genealogiesofsepharad.net/genealogies-of-sepharad/), an interdisciplinary group of scholars and writers from the United States, Spain, Portugal, and Israel who explore the meanings of Sepharadth century to the present. The group does not conduct individual or family genealogy searches (read more in [**About Us**](https://genealogiesofsepharad.net/about-us/)). [ the Centropa Archive](https://www.centropa.org/search-our-database-jewish-memory), a digitized collection of 1,200 interviews and 20,000 photographs of Jews who remained in Eastern and Central Europe, Russia, the Balkans, after surviving the Holocaust.
