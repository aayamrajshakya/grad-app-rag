## M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Mechanical Engineering (120 units)
Within the discipline of Mechanical Engineering, students will learn how to design and build AI-orchestrated systems capable of operating within engineering constraints. At Carnegie Mellon University, we are leading this transformation by teaching students how to simultaneously design a system’s functionality and supporting AI mechanisms, including both its AI algorithms and the platform on which the AI runs, to produce systems that are more adaptable, resilient, and trustworthy. The program is three semesters long.
### Students pursuing the M.S. in AI Engineering - Mechanical Engineering will be able to:
  * Apply deeper knowledge of AI methods, systems, tool chains, and cross-cutting issues including security, privacy and other ethical and societal challenges
  * Identify the engineering constraints that AI-orchestrated systems must operate within
  * Solve practical problems using AI methods
  * Adapt to the latest AI-enabled tools and learn how to work with and “advise” machines
  * Demonstrate graduate-level domain knowledge in mechanical engineering


### Requirements
Students with a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering or a related discipline with an interest in the intersection of AI and engineering are encouraged to apply to this program.
Students should be able to demonstrate proficiency in:
  * Programming (Python preferred) for data analysis
  * Probability/statistics such as probability distributions, joint and conditional probability, independence, marginalization, Bayes rules, and maximum likelihood estimation
  * Linear algebra topics such as matrix operations, linear transformations, projections, matrix derivatives, and eigendecomposition


### Relevant curriculum
The M.S. in Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Mechanical Engineering program is completed in three semesters with 120 units of coursework and the completion of a capstone research project. In addition to core and domain courses, students will complete graduate-level mechanical engineering courses, professional development units, technical electives, and College of Engineering units.
### Core courses
Systems and Tool Chains for AI Engineering  
Introduction to Machine Learning for Engineers  
Introduction to Deep Learning for Engineers
### Domain courses
60 units (~5 courses) should be taken in one of the following technical concentrations:
  * Design and Manufacturing of Mechanical Systems
  * Biomechanical Engineering and Medical Devices
  * Energy and Thermal Fluid Systems
  * Robotic and Control Systems


### Post-graduation outcomes
Whether pursuing academia or industry, this degree uniquely positions students for the future of research and high demand careers with a mastery of integrating engineering domain knowledge into AI solutions.
