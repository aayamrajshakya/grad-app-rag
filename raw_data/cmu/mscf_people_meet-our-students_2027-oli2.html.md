## Bio
I like finding clarity in chaos. That's why I dive. That's why I trade.  
  
Whether it's 30 feet underwater or in a volatile market, I'm drawn to environments that demand sharp focus, quick thinking, and steady nerves. I studied math and finance at NYU to understand how markets work, and interned on the Rates and MBS desks at Nomura, where I built tools to analyze curve risk, modeled cash flows for mortgage portfolios, and supported real-time decisions with traders.  
  
I've competed in global trading challenges, ranked in the top 0.8 percent, and led research projects that explore how information and behavior drive price action. These experiences taught me that edge doesn't come from theory alone; it's about asking the right questions, testing ideas, and staying adaptable when conditions shift.  
  
Now at Carnegie Mellon's MSCF program, I'm focused on becoming a quant who can manage complexity, make decisions under pressure, and deliver results from day one. I'm especially interested in macro trading and quant research, where uncertainty is constant and curiosity drives better outcomes.  
  
I bring energy and a strong foundation in both theory and practice. Let's connect if you're looking for someone who truly wants to compete in the market.
