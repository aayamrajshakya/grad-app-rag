#  Research 
As an Associate Teaching Professor in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, I am involved with the teaching and academic development of a variety of courses, including our calculus sequence, vector calculus, and matrix algebra. In addition, I have implemented the use of online tools to supplement these courses. I am also involved in the teaching and development of two courses involving math software: Introduction to Math Software, and Symbolic Programming Methods. My main research interests involve wavelets, fractals, image compression, and tilings. Recently I have been studying Haar-type multitiles in multiple dimensions and potential applications in image and data compression. On occasion, I teach Topics in Analysis, within which these areas of mathematics are addressed. A look at me in [action! ](http://www.math.cmu.edu/images/facultyimages/turkey.JPG)
