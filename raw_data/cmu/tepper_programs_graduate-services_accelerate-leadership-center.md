# Accelerate Leadership Center
The Accelerate Leadership Center (ALC)[The Intelligent Future℠](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/about). Coaching is at the heart of the experience. From your first day, you work with a full-time leadership coach who gets to know you and your goals. Together, you create a personalized plan for growth that is supported by immersive training, workshops, and practical experiences.
You have consistent access to coaches who are on campus every day and dedicated to your success. Each one brings years of industry and consulting experience, and they spend their time helping you strengthen the skills that matter most.
Through this experience, you will learn to:
  * Guide teams toward shared goals in a competitive global environment.  

  * Model leadership by setting clear objectives and driving progress.  

  * Communicate with confidence to achieve individual and group success.  

  * Lead with empathy and critical thinking so diverse teams thrive.  

  * Act with integrity and accountability in changing business environments.  

  * Influence others to create positive outcomes for your organization and community.


You also benefit from peer communication coaching. Each year, select MBA and Ph.D. students are trained as Communication Coaches to support you one-on-one with interviews, networking practice, presentations, and case competitions. Communication coaches work closely with the [Masters Career Center](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/graduate-services/masters-career-center) so their guidance matches the same standards, templates, and protocols you will use in your job search. At the same time, they offer the added perspective of a fellow student who understands the Tepper School experience firsthand.
> I faced several interviews in quick succession and was unsuccessful in all of them. After multiple sessions with Communication Coaches, I felt well-prepared for my next opportunity. As a result, I successfully interviewed with Amazon and secured an internship there. The Communication Coaching at the ALC played a key role in this achievement.
