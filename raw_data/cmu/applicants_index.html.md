The software systems that empower society require more than clever programmers. Now, more than ever, advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and autonomous systems demand engineers who can build reliable and trustworthy systems. Our program taught by top faculty at the #1 School of Computer Science will teach you to see the big picture and cut through vast quantities of information so you can negotiate trade-offs and build bridges faster.
The scale of modern software is unprecedented and multi-disciplinary. Our program will teach you to integrate engineering, managerial, and communication skills that top tech companies are eagerly competing for. With an integrated approach to engineering applied to real-world, industry-sponsored projects, you can grow to lead teams and master the design, construction and maintenance of complex systems without compromising quality.
Let your imagination guide us to a better future. From robotics to usability, machine vision to natural language processing — you will learn from, and build, lasting relationships with the world’s top experts. Becoming part of our alumni network will break down professional barriers and provide an instant connection to hundreds of accomplished, influential software engineering mentors and professionals across the globe.
The Master of Software Engineering degree from CMU is a **strategic** **investment** toward your future goals and ambitions. Find out how we can help you achieve your career dreams.

#  What makes the MSE programs special? 
## Take it to the next level and deliver.
The software systems that drive our modern world are not built on clever code alone. Our approach to learning takes you beyond foundations and teaches you how to build massive software systems that are on spec, on budget, and on time. Applying lessons learned in requirements gathering, project scoping, estimation, team management, architectural design, and assurance, our graduates are perfectly suited to do what few others can: DELIVER
## Don’t just join a program. Join a community.
The MSE is a family, a tribe. That's no joke! The MSE community is one of the largest, most accomplished, and most engaged of any graduate program across our campus. While you are here, you are going to form bonds that will last a lifetime — friends and colleagues you can call on. And, as a part of our alumni network, you will have an instant connection to hundreds of accomplished, influential software engineering professionals across the globe.
## Collaborate with the absolute best and brightest.
Our department, the Software and Societal Systems Department (S3D), was established within the School of Computer Science over twenty years ago for one purpose: Transdisciplinary Collaboration. And that purpose will suffuse your experience in the MSE. You are going to work with the best and brightest; not just from software engineering, but across the entire tech spectrum. From robotics to HCI, ML to NLP — you are encouraged to tap the expertise and call upon the guidance of some of the foremost minds in their respective fields.
