# Organizational Behavior and Theory
The field of Organizational Behavior and Theory addresses questions of why people behave the way they do in organizations and how to make individuals, groups, and organizations more effective. Research within the interdisciplinary field of OBT builds on its academic foundations of psychology, sociology, anthropology, and economics, highlighting how individuals are embedded within groups, groups are embedded within organizations, and organizations are embedded in and actively shape our society.
