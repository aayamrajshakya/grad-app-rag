CyLab researchers have developed many tools and technologies to help increase the security and privacy of our digital world. Below are a few highlighted demos, prototypes, and open-sourced code of some of those tools.
## State of the art password meter
Researchers in CyLab developed a state of the art password meter that offers real-time feedback and advice to help people create better passwords.

## Short-form Security Attitude Quiz
This six-item scale for assessing people’s security attitudes, developed by CyLab researchers, was created to improve strategies aimed at encouraging people to develop better security practices.

  * [Read the paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/soups2019-faklaris.pdf) about the security quiz, which was presented at the Fifteenth Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security.


## Password game
We know that users often create poor passwords. But is this because they don't know what makes a password strong or weak, or for another reason? CyLab researchers created a password quiz to better understand users’ perceptions of password security.

## PrivacyGrade
Many apps exhibit odd privacy-related behaviors. Does a flashlight app really need to access your microphone? A team of CyLab researchers created a website that assigns privacy grades to Android apps.

## EverCrypt
A team including CyLab researchers developed the world’s first industrial-strength cryptoraphic library, a set of code that can be used to protect data and is guaranteed to protect against the most popular classes of cyberattacks.

## Coconut
When app developers are coding data requests, privacy is oftentimes an afterthought. That motivated a team of CyLab researchers to create Coconut, an integrated development environment plugin that nudges developers to think a bit harder about user privacy when coding data requests.
  * [Give Coconut a try.](https://coconut-ide.github.io/)

## Chromium Taint Tracking
CyLab researchers developed a modified version of Google’s Chromium web browser that tracks taint information of strings, increasing the security by preventing attackers from executing commands on an unsuspecting user’s computer.
