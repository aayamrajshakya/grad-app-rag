# SI Supported Courses
Supplemental Instruction (SI) is an learning support model that utilizes peer-assisted study sessions. The SI program provides weekly sessions that provide students practice with course content outside the classroom. SI targets historically difficult courses as determined by data on past student performance.

# What is SI?
  * A non-remedial approach to learning for historically difficult courses which have been challenging for ALL students
  * A peer-led group study to help all students succeed
  * Facilitated by a student SI Leader, who has successfully completed the course


# Benefits of SI
  * Connecting with other students studying the same course
  * Guaranteed weekly study time that helps reinforce learning and retention of information
  * Learning in an inclusive and a casual environment
  * Learning study tools and successful exam techniques, specific to that course, from students who have succeeded in the course
