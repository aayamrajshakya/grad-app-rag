# Updates for Summer 2026 coming soon!
# CS Scholars
### CS Scholars will take a deep dive into the world of computer science through a combination of classroom instruction, hands-on research projects, faculty lectures, and industry engagement with leading tech companies around the country. 
## Program Overview
CS Scholars (CSS), a [CS Pathways](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cs-pathways/) initiative, is a four-week immersive experience on the CMU campus for rising high school juniors. This fully funded, merit-based program brings students together from around the country to explore computer science with Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and researchers who are leaders in the field. As a fully funded program, CS Scholars program costs are covered by CS Pathways through generous support from foundations, corporations, sponsors, and donors. Covered costs include tuition, housing, meal plans, and program related field trips and special events. Travel assistance may be requested by families for whom transportation costs to and from CMU would provide a significant barrier to attendance.
As a CS Scholar, you will engage in college-level courses, as well as weekly college prep and readiness seminars focused on college admissions, financial aid, social emotional wellbeing, and more. You'll develop meaningful connections with peers and mentors while being fully immersed in the college experience. A core value of [CS Pathways](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cs-pathways/) and the CS Scholars program is building an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive environment for all participants. You will be expected to uphold this value and to participate in discussions about equity within STEM and beyond.
Students who complete the program and demonstrate a desire to continue may be invited to return as rising seniors to CMU’s AI Scholars program the following summer! 
## Academic Information
CS Scholars will learn the core elements of programming and problem solving in Python. This will include algorithmic components (variables, functions, conditionals, and loops), basic data structures (lists and dictionaries), and problem-solving techniques (algorithmic thinking, top-down design, testing, and debugging). Scholars will also strengthen their computational skills in a pre-concepts of math course designed to dismantle the belief that you “just aren’t a math person.” You will participate in a hands-on group project that you will present to your peers and instructors at the end of the program. This project will apply your newly acquired skills to real-world challenges that use computer science for the betterment of humanity. In addition, you will engage with CMU faculty and industry leaders to learn about the vast and exciting opportunities in the field of computer science. 
The 2025 summer program is a four-week residential experience on the Carnegie Mellon campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Upon admission, you are required to participate for the full length of the four-week program dates. Admitted students are expected to give their full commitment to CS Scholars while in attendance - you will not be permitted to miss classes or schedule obligations for other (virtual) programs. If you are applying to multiple programs this summer, please take this expectation into consideration.
Core classes, guest lectures, group projects, workshops, and academic tours and field trips are held Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.* Evenings may consist of office hours, homework, group study, and social time. Weekends are yours to take part in field trips, participate in on campus clubs, and to explore the rich culture of Pittsburgh!
*Class times may vary day to day, but typically end between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.

## Testimonials
I can't speak more positively about our son's experience at Carnegie Mellon's Pre-College [CS Scholars] Program! It was a positive life-changing experience for him, and his first experience of what college life is like. The structure of the entire program, including weekend activities, was extremely well-planned. Thank you! ~ Catherine E. (Parent), CS Scholars 2023
CMU's Pre-College Programs [CS Scholars] was honestly one of the best experiences I've ever had. The classes were super engaging, and the professors and teachers made learning actually fun and exciting...I learned a ton, made lifelong memories, and left feeling more confident and connected than ever. ~Ren L., CS Scholars 2025
As a parent, I can't speak higly enough about CMU's dedication to its students. My child's growth this summer has been truly remarkable. ~Anonymous (Parent), CS Scholars 2025

## Questions?
For questions related to the Pre-College CS Scholars curriculum, contact Program Director Natalie Hatcher.
## Financial Need
CS Scholars utilizes a holistic application review and admissions process, looking at the full application and selecting program participants based on a combination of factors. Because we are a fully funded, merit-based program for participants, demonstration of financial need is one of these factors. There is no option for participants to pay out of pocket tuition fees for this program, and documentation of financial need is required for application submission. Documentation includes either tax documents or[NACAC Application Fee Waiver](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-feewaiver-fillable.pdf) signed by your high school guidance department.   
  
Further information is below, but please feel free to reach out with questions to Natalie Hatcher, CSS Program Director.
## Is this program only for students with financial need?
The CS Scholars program is intended to create opportunities for students who lack access and/or resources at home, at school, or in their communities. This can mean financial need, it can mean a lack of computer science education in your school district or community, or lack of access to affordable/stable internet or computing devices. We recognize that students may not meet the current financial need requirements, but may still lack access or opportunity for other reasons. If any of this resonates with your experience, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are still unsure if this program is for you, please reach out to Natalie Hatcher at nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu.
## Examples of demonstrated financial need
Students in any of the below categories are considered to demonstrate financial need: 
  * Students who have received or are eligible to receive an ACT or SAT testing fee waiver.
  * Students who are enrolled in or eligible to participate in the Federal Free or Reduced-Price Lunch Program (FRPL).
  * Students whose family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
  * Students who are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
  * Students whose family receives public assistance.
  * Students who live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless.
  * Students who are a ward of the state or an orphan.
  * Students who can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader. 


All applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered.
