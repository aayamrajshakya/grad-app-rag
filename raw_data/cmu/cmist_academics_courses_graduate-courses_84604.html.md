# Analysis of Current US National Security Priorities
## Course Number: 84-604 
This discussion-based course will examine the headlines in international relations, defense, national security, and homeland security. We will follow major news stories, breaking down media coverage to go deeper, conducting our own unique analysis as a group but also individually, contextualizing issues within the broader global context using the U.S. National Security Strategy (NSS), U.S. National Defense Strategy (NDS), and the U.S. Annual Threat Assessment (ATA) to anchor discussions. Students will study the NSS, NDS and the ATA closely—and learn how to look at U.S. national security priorities through this lens. Students will have the opportunity to lead discussions on breaking news stories, but also to draw upon prior past headlines which still dominate the news cycle or have wider implications for international relations and issues in national security. The goal of this course is to understand U.S. national security priorities, encourage students to think deliberately and deeply about U.S. national security priorities and to contextualize those events in the broader international relations and security context.
