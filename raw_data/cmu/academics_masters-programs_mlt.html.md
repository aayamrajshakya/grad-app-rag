# Master of Language Technologies
The Master of Language Technologies (MLT) program is a two-year, research-focused Master's program intended to prepare students for a Ph.D. program, whether it be at the LTI or elsewhere.
## Overview
The [](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/) prepares students for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for two full years. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your summer will be devoted entirely to research. Many MLT grads continue on to Ph.D. programs at CMU and other top institutions, while others pursue careers at companies emphasizing research and rapid innovation.
## Requirements
The MLT program lasts two years (24 months), and students must complete two summers of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their second year.
MLT students take 120 or more course units (about 10 courses), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.
Directed research is another integral part of the MLT program; MLT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
Students may also choose to complete an optional MLT thesis. Guidelines can be found in the MLT Handbook.
## Curriculum
Here's an example of how your two years in the MLT program may break down.
|  Fall |  Spring |  Summer  
---|---|---|---  
Year 1 |  Grammars and Lexicons Algorithms for NLP Directed Study |  Search Engines or Machine Learning for Text Mining Machine Translation Self-Paced Lab Directed Study |  Required Research  
Year 2 |  Software Engineering for LT (I) Speech Understanding Self-Paced Lab Directed Study |  Software Engineering for LT (II) Directed Study Elective |  Required Research  
## Course Categories
See the [MLT and 5LT Course Categories](https://lti.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt-course-categories.html) page. 
## Admissions
Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized [online application process](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr#HERE). Applications and all supporting documentation for fall admission to any of the LTI's graduate programs must be received by the application deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered. **  
**
The application window for the Fall 2026 admissions cycle will open on September 3, 2025. Please see the SCS Graduate Admissions Page.
*Please note, we no longer require mailed, hard versions of transcripts or test scores at the time of application. Do not mail anything to the admissions office. If you are accepted to a program, you will be given instruction to then mail your materials.
Application Deadlines
More information about application deadlines can be found[HERE](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr)
Application Fees: 
Fee Waivers
If the application fee presents financial hardship to the applicant, they may apply for a financial or participants of program fee waiver which is available within the application.
Requirements
The School of Computer Science requires the following for all graduate program applications:
  * GRE scores: GREs are now optional, but if you want to submit GRE scores:  
These must be less than five years old. A GRE subject test in science, engineering, computer science, math, etc. is not required, but you may complete one and submit the scores if you wish. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.
  * TOEFL scores: Required if English is not your native language. No exceptions. These scores may be more than two years oldif you have pursued or are pursuing a bachelor's in the United States.
  * Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.
  * Current resume.
  * Statement of Purpose.
  * Three letters of recommendation.


For more details on these requirements, please see the[SCS Master's Admissions page](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions).
In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires:
  * Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter.
  * Video Essay (optional, but strongly recommended). You will have 1-3 minutes to record a video of yourself answering a question that we will provide. You will first be able to complete a test video, which will give you instructions and allow you to practice how the recording will work. You can complete more than one test video. Once you are satisfied and have confirmed that you're ready to record your real submission, you will receive a random question and will have 10 (ten) seconds before the video begins recording. You then have up to 3 minutes to speak and can stop recording once you are done speaking. You will be given 3 attempts, and a new question will be provided with each attempt.Note that the video (and audio) must be of the applicant (not a proxy). If there is more than one person in the video, please clarify which person is the applicant. What you do or say is totally up to you as long as you provide the information requested.If all else is equal, an applicant with a video essay will have an advantage over an otherwise identical applicant without a video essay.Again, this is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested.


No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.
