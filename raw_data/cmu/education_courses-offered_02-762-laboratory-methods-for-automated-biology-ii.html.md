# Laboratory Methods for Automated Biology II
## Course Number: 02-762 
This laboratory course provides a continuation and extension of experiences in 02-761. Instruction will consist of lectures and laboratory experience using multi-purpose laboratory robotics. During weekly laboratory time, students will complete and integrate parts of two larger projects. The first project will be focused on the execution of a molecular biology experiment requiring nucleic acid extraction, library preparation for sequencing, and quality control. The second project will be focused on the implementation and execution of automated methods using active learning techniques to direct the learning of a predictive model for a large experimental space (such as learning the effects of many possible drugs on many possible targets).
This course is designed for first-year MS in Automated Science students.
