We welcome students of many diverse undergraduate backgrounds to pursue graduate studies in engineering at Carnegie Mellon. With a few prerequisites and make-up courses, a graduate degree through CEE is accessible to all students with math and science backgrounds.
## All entering students must have taken the following:
Students must have taken the following courses Topic | Number of semesters  
---|---  
General Chemistry | 1 semester  
Calculus | 2 semesters  
Differential Equations | 1 semester  
Physics | 2 semesters  
Biology (or other science) | 1 semester  
Probability and Statistics OR Linear Algebra | 1 semester  
Computer Programming, Applications, or Tools | 1 semester  
## Make-up requirements for M.S. in Civil and Environmental Engineering
To pursue the standard MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering degree, you will need to complete four basic undergraduate engineering courses in addition to the courses required for the graduate degree. These makeup requirements have been put in place to make sure that you have the necessary groundwork for more advanced engineering studies at the graduate level. Courses include:
Make up requirements for MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering Course | Units | Timing  
---|---|---  
[12-212: Statics](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/education/course-descriptions/12-212.html) | 9 | First fall semester  
[12-335: Soil Mechanics](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/education/course-descriptions/12-335.html) | 9 | Second fall semester  
[12-355: Fluid Mechanics](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/education/course-descriptions/12-355.html) | 9 | First fall semester  
[12-411: Project Management Constructions](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/education/course-descriptions/12-411.html) | 9 | First or second fall semester  
## Alternative degrees without makeup requirements
CEE offers alternative degree options that do not have undergraduate makeup requirements, including:
  * M.S. in Environmental Management and Science
  * M.S. in Advanced Infrastructure Systems
  * M.S. in Computational Mechanics


Some of these programs may require additional coursework to ensure students have the appropriate background knowledge for specific graduate courses.
