## Bio
I graduated from UCLA with a B.S. in Mathematics of Computation, where I built a strong foundation in applied math, computer science, and data analysis. Before joining the MSCF program, I developed a deep interest in quantitative finance and sought to further hone my understanding of financial markets through an interdisciplinary lens. During my internships at BroadRiver Asset Management and Icarus Fund, I built Python tools to automate portfolio analytics, engineered features from large-scale insurance datasets, and applied statistical models and backtesting frameworks to equity strategies. These experiences strengthened my interest in systematic investing and data-driven decision-making. I aim to pursue a career in quantitative research or trading, where I can apply machine learning, programming, and mathematical modeling to help generate alpha and drive investment performance.
