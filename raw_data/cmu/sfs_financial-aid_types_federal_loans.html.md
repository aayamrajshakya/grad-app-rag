## Federal Direct Student Loan
The Federal Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans are the most widely-used loans for college students and are available to both undergraduate and graduate students. Subsidized Loans are available to undergraduate students with financial need. Unsubsidized Loans are available to some undergraduate and graduate students and are not based on financial need. Consideration for these loans is determined by completing the FAFSA.
