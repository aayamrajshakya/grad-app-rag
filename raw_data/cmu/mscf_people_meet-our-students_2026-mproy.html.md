## Bio
Mishael graduated from the University of Maryland, College Park, with a degree in Information Systems in 2020. During his time, he interned at the Federal Reserve, Ally Bank, and Bank of America as a quantitative analyst intern. Mishael discovered his true passion for quantitative finance through a personal project he embarked on during his senior year of college, where he developed multiple algorithmic sports trading strategies. Now, Mishael looks to apply that same quantitative and technical expertise to the world of finance and investments, and that's why he's joined the MSCF program.
