# Updates for Summer 2026 coming soon!
# AI Scholars
### AI Scholars will take a deep dive into the world of artificial intelligence through a combination of classroom instruction, hands-on research projects, faculty lectures, and industry engagement with leading tech companies around the country.
## Program Overview
AI Scholars (AIS), a [CS Pathways](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cs-pathways/) initiative, is a four-week immersive experience on the CMU campus for rising high school seniors. This fully funded, merit-based program brings students together from around the country to explore artificial intelligence with Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and researchers who are leaders in the field. As a fully funded program, AI Scholars program costs are covered by CS Pathways through generous support from foundations, corporations, sponsors, and donors. Covered costs include tuition, housing, meal plans, and program-related field trips and special events. Travel assistance may be requested by families for whom transportation costs to and from CMU would provide a significant barrier to attendance.
As an AI Scholar, you will engage in college-level courses, as well as weekly college prep and readiness seminars focused on college admissions, financial aid, social emotional wellbeing, and more. You'll develop meaningful connections with peers and mentors while being fully immersed in the college experience. A core value of [CS Pathways](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/cs-pathways/) and the AI Scholars program is building an inclusive, welcoming, and supportive environment for all participants. You will be expected to uphold this value and to participate in discussions about equity in STEM and beyond.
## Academic Information
AI Scholars will participate in project-based learning and attend lectures in various aspects of computing and artificial intelligence. You will participate in a hands-on group project that you will present to your peers and instructors at the end of the program. This project will apply your newly acquired skills to real-world challenges that use artificial intelligence for the betterment of humanity. In addition, you will engage with industry leaders to learn about the vast and exciting opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence. 
The 2025 summer program is a four-week residential experience on the Carnegie Mellon campus in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Upon admission, you are required to participate for the full length of the four-week program dates. Admitted students are expected to give their full commitment to AI Scholars while in attendance - you will not be permitted to miss classes or schedule obligations for other (virtual) programs. If you are applying to multiple programs this summer, please take this expectation into consideration.
Core classes, guest lectures, group projects, workshops, and academic tours and field trips are held Monday through Friday between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m.* Evenings may consist of office hours, homework, group study, and social time. Weekends are yours to take part in field trips, participate in on-campus clubs, and to explore the rich culture of Pittsburgh!
*Class times may vary day to day, but typically end between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m.

## Testimonials
My experience at Carnegie Mellon Pre College Programs was truly life-changing. Something I'll never forget. The program not only challenged me academically but also provided valuable learning experiences and chances for personal development fueling my interest in computer science and AI. Collaborating on projects, with encouraging classmates and professors helped me grow both professionally and personally. The lively campus atmosphere and strong sense of belonging made my time incredibly fulfilling and motivating solidifying my decision to pursue computer science at CMU for my studies. ~ Eli T., AI Scholars 2024
I’m blown away… this program has been an amazing experience for Vincent and it’s been a wonderful growth to see in him. He came back curious and limitless; daring to attempt impossible things and has not stopped asking “what if … ?” instead of stating “No, because….” ~ Anonymous (Parent), AI Scholars 2023

## Questions?
For questions related to the Pre-College AI Scholars curriculum, contact Program Director Natalie Hatcher.
## Financial Need
AI Scholars (AIS) utilizes a holistic application review and admissions process, looking at the full application and selecting program participants based on a combination of factors. Because we are a fully funded, merit-based program for participants, demonstration of financial need is one of these factors. There is no option for participants to pay out of pocket tuition fees for this program, and documentation of financial need is required for application submission. Documentation includes either tax documents or[NACAC Application Fee Waiver](https://www.nacacnet.org/wp-content/uploads/2024-feewaiver-fillable.pdf) signed by your high school guidance department.   
  
Further information is below, but please feel free to reach out with questions to Natalie Hatcher, AIS Program Director.
## Is this program only for students with financial need?
The AI Scholars program is intended to create opportunities for students who lack access and/or resources at home, at school, or in their communities. This can mean financial need, it can mean a lack of computer science education in your school district or community, or lack of access to affordable/stable internet or computing devices. We recognize that students may not meet the current financial need requirements, but may still lack access or opportunity for other reasons. If any of this resonates with your experience, we strongly encourage you to apply. If you are still unsure if this program is for you, please reach out to Natalie Hatcher at nhatcher@andrew.cmu.edu.
## Examples of demonstrated financial need
Students in any of the below categories are considered to demonstrate financial need: 
  * Students who have received or are eligible to receive an ACT or SAT testing fee waiver.
  * Students who are enrolled in or eligible to participate in the Federal Free or Reduced-Price Lunch Program (FRPL).
  * Students whose family income falls within the Income Eligibility Guidelines set by the USDA Food and Nutrition Service.
  * Students who are enrolled in a federal, state, or local program that aids students from low-income families (e.g., TRIO programs such as Upward Bound).
  * Students whose family receives public assistance.
  * Students who live in federally subsidized public housing, a foster home, or are homeless.
  * Students who are a ward of the state or an orphan.
  * Students who can provide a supporting statement from a school official, college access counselor, financial aid officer, or community leader. 


All applicants who meet the eligibility requirements will be considered.
