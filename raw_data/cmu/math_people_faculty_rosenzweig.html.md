#  Research 
My current research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical physics, nonlinear partial differential equations, and probability. More specifically, I have been recently interested in the mathematics of nonlinear dispersive, fluid, and kinetic equations and their derivation through scaling limits from underlying physical problems, such as large classical & quantum systems of particles or waves. More details on my research can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6svrt3adkandkw1/MHR%20Research%20Statement_10.1.2022.pdf?dl=0).
My research is funded in part by the NSF through grant DMS-2206085.
