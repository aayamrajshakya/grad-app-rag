# The Carnegie Mellon Doctoral Program in History is small by design, enabling an exceptional level of individual attention from faculty.
We strongly emphasize research training while also facilitating a range of opportunities for skill-building, not only through our coursework but also through a funded internship program, teaching experiences and training, and workshops. Students are able to take advantage of Carnegie Mellon University and its diverse strengths in the sciences, public policy, technology, and the arts. They are also able to take advantage of a tuition exchange program, which enables them to enroll in other local universities; and more broadly, take advantage of the archival, cultural, and historical resources of Pittsburgh.

## Carnegie Mellon's program is based around two particular areas of faculty strength:
  * ## History of Science, Technology and the Environment
  * ## Social and Political Movements


We are particularly interested in applicants who have research and teaching interests in one of these areas. Though these are not separate programs or formal tracks within the department, these areas do pay homage to the department's longstanding areas of innovation, including as a founding institution of social history and applied history. Despite our small size, the department has at least one faculty member specializing in each of the areas of history of  
  
The curriculum itself is designed to foster a broad base of historical expertise, offering thematic courses as well as intensive seminars on research and historical methods. Because the program is small, we also build in at least one elective each semester to ensure students have a chance to take courses more tailored to their specific interests. In addition to strong national/regional training, our program aims to provide students with broad exposure to transnational and comparative issues.
Our financial package includes tuition, health insurance, fees, and a living stipend. In addition, we offer several additional scholarships and research grants that make it possible for our students to attend conferences and to conduct research across the United States and abroad.  
  
In applying to the program, it is important that prospective students seek out and find a possible advisor or advisors from the field(s) in which they wish to specialize.

The department’s Ph.D. program bestows a Master’s degree en route to the Ph.D. after the successful completion of four semesters of course work (with passing grades in all courses) and the production of a research paper. We do not require a Master's degree of applicants and all students complete the same course of study regardless of prior preparation.
