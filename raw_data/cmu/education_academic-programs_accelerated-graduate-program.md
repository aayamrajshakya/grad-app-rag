# Undergraduate Accelerated Graduate Program
## Accelerated Graduate Program
The Accelerated Graduate Program – MS in Robotics is available to currently enrolled Carnegie Mellon undergraduates. It allows students to receive an admission decision to the MS in Robotics (MSR) program early and without paying to submit a full application. Students interested in the program should apply at the beginning of their senior year. Admission decisions are announced the following January. The goal is to confirm acceptance prior to the normal job search and graduate school acceptance times. Early admission may also allow students to tailor the remainder of their undergraduate program to prepare for the masters program.
*If a student applies to this program and other MS/PhD programs and if admitted to this and other programs, the student must choose one program.
###  Contact the MSR Program Manager, Barbara (B.J.) Fecich with questions.
## Eligibility
  * Current Carnegie Mellon undergraduate student in their senior year
  * Have identified a RI faculty member who has agreed to advise your MSR thesis research project (Advantageous for admission. Required if starting the program immediately following completion of your bachelor’s degree.)


## Application Components
