## Bio
A quant who builds like an architect, or an architect who sees structure in markets?  
  
I design systems that are clear, smart, and strong. My background in architecture taught me to think in layers and logic. Now I use that same mindset in quant finance to build models that search for alpha and uncover value. I enjoy turning complex ideas into practical tools.  
  
In my last quant research internship, I led an alpha-seeking project. I built a full workflow: data processing, model training, and backtesting. The process ran well, and the results were strong. I used Python, C++, and Stata proficiently to keep things fast, clean, and flexible. I am comfortable with everything from high-frequency data cleaning to machine learning model tuning.  
  
I've also worked on several research projects in innovative asset pricing. I like to read the latest papers, test fresh ideas, whether in asset pricing or machine learning models, and bring theory to life. I enjoy the process of finding new ways to read and interact with the market.  
  
I want to join a hedge fund where I can apply my passion and skills each day. I aim to grow with the team, contribute to real results, and keep learning.  
  
I'm happy to chat on Zoom or meet in person, whichever works best for you..
