## Bio
Jay Aronson is the founder and director of the [Center for Human Rights Science](http://www.cmu.edu/chrs/index.html) at Carnegie Mellon University.
He is also Professor of Science, Technology, and Society in the History Department. Prof. Aronson’s research and teaching examine the interactions of science, technology, law, media, and human rights in a variety of contexts. For the past several years, he has been focusing on deaths in law enforcement custody in the United States. His recent book Death in Custody: How America Ignores the Truth and What We Can Do about It (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2023), co-authored with Dr. Roger A. Mitchell, Jr., examines the history of efforts to counteract official government ignorance on this issue and proposes a variety of practical solutions to the lack of data about how many people die in custody each year.  
  
Prof. Aronson maintains an active interest in the use of digital evidence (especially video) in human rights investigations. In this context, he primarily facilitates partnerships between computer scientists and human rights practitioners to develop better tools and methods for acquiring, authenticating, analyzing, and archiving human rights media. Prof. Aronson has also been involved in a variety of projects with colleagues from statistics, political science, and conflict monitoring to improve the quality of civilian casualty recording and estimation in times of conflict.  
  
Previously, Prof. Aronson spent nearly a decade examining the ethical, political, and social dimensions of post-conflict and post-disaster identification of the missing and disappeared in collaboration with a team of anthropologists, bioethicists, and forensic scientists he assembled. His book, Who Owns the Dead? The Science and Politics of Death at Ground Zero (Harvard University Press, 2016), which analyzes the recovery, identification, and memorialization of the victims of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, was a culmination of this effort. This work built on his first book, Genetic Witness (Rutgers University Press, 2007), a study of the development of forensic DNA profiling within the American criminal justice system.  
  
Prof. Aronson received his Ph.D. in the History of Science and Technology from the University of Minnesota and was both a pre- and post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.
