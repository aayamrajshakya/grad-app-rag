# Take your unique undergraduate experience to the next level!
The Integrated Master of Science in Computational Biology is designed to provide advanced training for students who have completed one of CMU’s undergraduate degrees in addition to significant foundational coursework to prepare for accelerated study (see FAQ below). Students will get more refined training from experts in the field who are doing work on the cutting edge of not only computational biology research but also with experts in biology, machine learning, etc. Being housed within the top-ranked School of Computer Science, the program itself focuses on a high level of proficiency on the development and refinement of computational methods for solving biological problems; both at the fundamental model level as well as directly applicable biological results. Our students are all highly vested in continuing the advances being made on all types of problems in computational biology.

#  Hear from our Students 
The program provides a lot of flexibility in courses which allowed me to specialize in classes that align with my career goals. I am eager to deepen my knowledge beyond the foundational concepts by taking more specialized courses and working on practical projects that will equip me with the experience and skills necessary to face the challenges in industry.”

“I'm getting experience from leading professors in niches that I didn't know existed within Computational Biology and feel much more prepared to enter exciting industry roles. ”

# What makes this program different? 
The audience of this program is distinct from the other masters programs offered within the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department ([M.S. in Automated Science](https://msas.cbd.cmu.edu/) and [M.S. in Computational Biology ](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/)[joint with the Department of Biological Sciences]). The other programs aim to educate students who may have limited exposure to computer science or computational biology and are seeking re-education to become computational biologists or automation engineers. As such, the first year of the degree is devoted to foundational coursework in programming, algorithms, mathematics, statistics, and computational biology. 
Our undergraduate students are highly prepared in these areas and thus this foundation has already been established and does not need to be built (thus our students do not regularly enter these programs). To cater to our own highly prepared students this program builds on this foundation to provide the graduate level training as well as research or industry experience (through a thesis and/or capstone project). 
#  You get to choose your culminating experience: 
The capstone further prepares students to become immediate leaders in the field after program completion. The capstone project, in collaboration with our industry partner, will provide an invaluable training opportunity to get insight into the differences between industry and academic projects under the guidance of both our industry partners in collaboration with department faculty.
The thesis option provides a real-word, hands-on, and somewhat longer-term, experience working on the cutting edge of the field with any member of our [CBD faculty](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/voting-faculty.html). For those students looking to continue their graduate career, or those unsure of their direction, it facilitates exploration in yet-to-be discovered findings.

All students completing a B.S. in Computational Biology (or the additional major in Computational Biology) meet these requirements as part of their major requirements. Students completing a minor or a concentration in computational biology will likely have completed a significant subset of these courses, depending on their primary major.
## I am still enrolled in some of the prerequisite courses, can I still apply?
Yes! In the case that you’re completing the prerequisite coursework in your final semester(s) we can provide a conditional acceptance pending your final grades. 
## I’m not a Computational Biology major, what do I need to do to prepare to join the program? 
We welcome all students to the program who have an interest in learning computational biology, in your semesters before graduation you should make sure that you’ve completed (or have a plan to complete) the prerequisite coursework, and that's it! 
## How can I keep up to date with information about the program? 
Join our [mailing list](https://forms.gle/JiX8pKfJkHFfmemi7), and let us know your graduation year so we can make sure to have timely information ready for you as you progress through your undergrad. 
## Whom should I contact if I have other questions? 
You can contact the program director at integrated-ms-director@compbio.cmu.edu.
## Where can I find all the details about program requirements?
The [program handbook](https://cbd.cmu.edu/education/integrated-masters/integrated_ms_computational_biology_handbook_ay24.pdf) has a written description of all the program requirements and policies.
