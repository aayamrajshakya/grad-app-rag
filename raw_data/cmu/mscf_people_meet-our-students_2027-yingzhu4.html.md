## Bio
Have you ever jumped out of a plane?  
I have twice. Skydiving is a calculated risk: high adrenaline, fast pace, real consequences. You're fully in control, making split-second decisions as you guide the parachute down. Finance is also about managing uncertainty. You need clear judgment, mental discipline, and the ability to act when the stakes are high. I've learned to stay focused under pressure and make decisions with conviction.  
  
After earning dual degrees in Computer Science and Finance, with a Math minor, I spent two years in private equity, contributing to deal execution, financial modeling, and portfolio monitoring. That front-row seat to market behavior showed me the value of combining intuition with quantitative rigor. It's what led me to Carnegie Mellon's Master's in Computational Finance (MSCF) program, where I'm now expanding my skills in stochastic modeling, data analysis, and algorithmic strategy.  
  
If you're looking for a Summer 2026 Quant Intern who can bridge the gap between markets and models, I bring a rare mix: hands-on investing experience, strong communication, and technical depth. I build robust models, write reliable code, and approach every problem with both precision and perspective. You can email me or reach out via LinkedIn-let's connect! I'm happy to chat over Zoom or in person.
