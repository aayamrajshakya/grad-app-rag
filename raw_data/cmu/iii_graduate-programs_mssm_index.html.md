Although most of our students have a computer science-related undergraduate degree, there is no one path to the MSSM. You are well on your way if you excelled in your engineering or science undergraduate degree or an equivalent program where you developed your logical reasoning capacity.Those with undergraduate degrees outside of computer science, software engineering, or information technology, or simply questioning if their technical skills meet the prerequisites of the MSSM, should review the following LinkedIn Learning resources:  

If these skills are familiar to you, great! Consider applying for the MSSM program.
