In addition to our extensive list of research and professional master's programs, the School of Computer Science offers a number of fifth-year and accelerated master's degree programs specifically designed for Carnegie Mellon undergraduates. The programs often allow students who have completed the necessary prerequisites to apply credits from undergraduate courses toward their master's and graduate more quickly (e.g., in two semesters instead of three). 
A list of all fifth-year and accelerated programs is included below, with links to the departments that administer them. For other graduate options, visit our [master's](https://cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs) and [Ph.D. program](https://cs.cmu.edu/academics/phd/programs) pages.
## Fifth-Year and Accelerated Master's Programs by Department
### Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department
#### [Integrated Master's Degree Program in Computational Biology](https://cbd.cmu.edu/education/integrated-masters/index.html)
The Integrated Master of Science in Computational Biology is designed to provide advanced training for students who have completed one of CMU's undergraduate degrees in addition to significant foundational coursework to prepare for accelerated study. Students will get more refined training from experts in the field who are doing work on the cutting edge of not only computational biology research but also with experts in biology, machine learning and more.
### Computer Science Department
#### [Fifth-Year Master's in Computer Science — Research](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/master/fifth_year_masters.html)
The Fifth Year Master's in Computer Science is a direct master's program for students receiving a bachelor of computer science from Carnegie Mellon. This M.S. program focuses on research: students must complete a substantial M.S. research project with an SCS adviser in addition to taking courses.
### Human-Computer Interaction Institute
#### [Accelerated Master of Human-Computer Interaction](https://hcii.cmu.edu/academics/hci-undergraduate/accelerated-masters)
The Accelerated Master of Human-Computer Interaction program provides CMU undergraduate HCI majors with an opportunity to complete a master's in human-computer interaction in an additional two semesters following graduation. Accepted students join the MHCI capstone in the spring semester of their senior year, graduate in May with their undergraduate degree, and then go right into being a graduate student in the summer while completing their capstone project with MHCI. The fall semester allows them to complete their electives for the master's portion of the program. Students should apply by Nov. 1 of their senior year.
#### [Accelerated Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences (A-METALS)](https://metals.hcii.cmu.edu/accelerated-masters/)
CMU undergraduates in any majors and other eligible students (such as those from the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education) who have completed the appropriate courses may be eligible to enroll in the Accelerated Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences (A-METALS) program. A-METALS students will be allowed to complete the master's degree in as little as two semesters (eight months) after their undergraduate degree, instead of the usual three semesters (12 months).
### Language Technologies Institute
#### [Master of Language Technologies: Integrated Studies](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters-programs/mlt-is.html)
The Master of Language Technologies: Integrated Studies (5LT) program is a fifth-year, research-oriented program for SCS undergraduates who are interested in pursuing a language technologies research career in academia or industry. The 5LT program lasts 12 months. During the academic year, students split their time between taking courses and doing research with a faculty advisor; in the summer, they focus entirely on research.
### Machine Learning Department
#### [Fifth-Year Master's in Machine Learning](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms.html)
The Fifth Year Master's in Machine Learning allows Carnegie Mellon undergraduates to earn an M.S. degree in one additional year by taking some of the required machine learning courses as an undergraduate.
### Robotics Institute
#### [Accelerated Graduate Program — M.S. Robotics](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/accelerated-graduate-program/)
The Accelerated Graduate Program — M.S. in Robotics is available to currently enrolled CMU undergraduates. It allows students to receive an admission decision to the M.S. in Robotics (MSR) program early without paying to submit a full application. Students interested in the program should apply at the beginning of their senior year.
### Software and Societal Systems Department
#### [Fifth-Year Master's in Privacy Engineering](https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/masters/plan/index.html)
The Fifth-Year Master's in Privacy Engineering (MPE) program is designed for computer scientists and engineers who wish to pursue careers as privacy engineers or technical privacy managers. Designed in close collaboration with industry and government, this program is intended for students who aspire to play a critical role in building privacy into future products, services and processes. CMU undergraduates may complete the MPE degree as a fifth-year student by following the 12-month track.
#### [IS-MSE Accelerated Master's Program](https://mse.s3d.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-amp.html)
The IS-MSE Accelerated Master's Program (AMP) is a fifth-year master's program for undergraduates majoring in Information Systems; this is a joint offering of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon. Fifth-year AMP students may choose either the Scalable Systems or Embedded Systems program.
