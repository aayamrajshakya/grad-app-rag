## Bio
Aadityavardhan graduated from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2024, with a Bachelor in Computer Science and a Mathematics minor, where he secured a rank of 5 out of the 111 students in his Computer Science cohort. Aadityavardhan's time in Hong Kong gave him exposure to industry professionals and finance interns, instilling in him a passion for financial markets and prompting him to leverage his programming, machine learning, and mathematical skills in the realm of quantitative finance. To develop his interest, he enrolled into several finance and statistics courses, and achieved straight A's across them. As a computer science undergraduate, he also scripted a backend for an AI system, developed automation frameworks, and also designed and created programming assignments as a TA. He joined the MSCF program due to its highly organic overlapping of computer science, mathematics, and finance, allowing him to explore and develop all of his strengths and passions in a high caliber cohort. He hopes to eventually apply his knowledge and skillset in a quantitative trading role.
