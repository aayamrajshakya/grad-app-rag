Our lab uses proteomics, fluorescent probe development and time-lapse microscopy to study two central questions in developmental biology:
  * Tissue morphogenesis: Embryo development is typified by a tremendous amount of cell movement. How do the cells in fruit fly (Drosphilia) embryos change their shape to drive tissue morphogenesis?
  * Programmed cell death: Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a central role in embryonic development. How do cells decide to die to maintain tissue homeostasis? ([more](http://www.bio.cmu.edu/laboratories/minden/research/ "Research"))
