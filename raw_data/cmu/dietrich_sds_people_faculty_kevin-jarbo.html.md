## Bio
Kevin Jarbo is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences. Working with SDS Department Head Linda Babcock and Kody Manke in the Psychology Department, his research will explore how the risk of confirming a stereotype about a student's individual or group identity influences whether, and how much, they attempt to avoid potentially negative interpersonal experiences and interactions in academic settings. In 2018, Kevin received a Ph.D. in psychology with a certificate in cognitive neuroscience from the Center of the Neural Basis of Cognition at Carnegie Mellon. His doctoral work focused on how context impacts aversive decision-making behavior and the brain regions and circuitry involved in that process. Kevin also supports work in CMU's Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion, where he advises individual students and student organizations involved in social justice activism and implements programs focused on the intersections of race and masculine gender identity development.
