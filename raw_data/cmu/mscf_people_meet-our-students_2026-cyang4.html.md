After graduation and before joining MSCF, Caroline joined JPMorgan full-time as an investment banking analyst, where she contributed to multiple billion-dollar landmark IPOs and M&A deals, enhancing her financial analysis skills and industry knowledge in finance. She also developed strong leadership and communication skills, as well as the ability to thrive under pressure.
