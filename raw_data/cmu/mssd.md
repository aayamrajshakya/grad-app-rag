## Program Overview
The MSSD program advances design methodologies that integrate multicultural and geospatial aspects of ecological thinking, focusing on addressing architectural responses to climate change. It incorporates dynamic bioclimatic processes into the design of constructed environments, guiding students to explore climate-specific socio-ecological placemaking through computational design, environmental science, material research and advanced manufacturing. The program emphasizes the relationship between historical patterns and new technologies, constructed and natural systems, the symbiosis of human and non-human environments, energy systems and human-centered design, regenerative landscapes and circular economies, bio-based material production, and the integration of architectural assemblies. The goal is to cultivate actionable decarbonization expertise and understand the holistic ecological impact of design and construction.

## Program Curriculum
Supported by a foundation in key technical climate-related issues, the MSSD program offers an intensive, yet flexible curriculum designed to allow students to define their path toward a specific area of ecological knowledge and expertise. The program combines critical inquiry with self-driven design research courses, complemented by expert technical and computational skills offered at the School of Architecture and across Carnegie Mellon University. The curriculum emphasizes the integration of design and technology, the value of total-building performance, material circularity, human-centered design, large-scale ecology, and natural systems knowledge with ecological systems analysis and creative design processes.
[MSSD PROGRAM Curriculum](https://live-cmu-soa-2023.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2024-08/MSSD_curriculum_2024-25.pdf)
Our students benefit from an interdisciplinary academic environment with courses spanning architecture, material science, human-computer interaction, computer science, engineering, humanities, art and design, psychology and more. The curriculum offers both depth and breadth, culminating in a thesis project that allows students to focus their research and integrate the ecological impact of their work with topics of personal and professional interest. MSSD theses are published in [MSSD KiltHub](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/collections/Master_of_Science_in_Sustainable_Design/5757920), CMU's online repository, and students are encouraged and guided to share their innovative work at other academic and professional venues.

THESIS DATA MAP: Project research focus distribution 2017-2024 ([doi.org/10.1184/R1/c.5757920](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/collections/Master_of_Science_in_Sustainable_Design/5757920))
The program offers a four-semester/two academic years curriculum to complete the study. It also allows for the integration of the Accelerated Master Programs (AMP) as well as the sequential completion of two School of Architecture graduate degrees within an expedited time frame. 
  * Residency Requirement
    * The MSSD program is a two-year (4 semesters) program with a minimum residency of three (3) academic semesters at full-time status (36 units).
    * The MSSD program is STEM-eligible. This means that in addition to one year of OPT, a student may apply for a 24-month [OPT STEM Extension](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/employment/f1-students/opt-stem-opt-extension/opt-stem-extension.html).
    * MSSD full-time students are limited to a maximum of 54 units per semester. The program Track Chair must approve any additional units.
    * The MSSD program supports the transition of undergraduate programs to the [Accelerated Masters Program](https://www.architecture.cmu.edu/accelerated) (AMP) within the School of Architecture: B.A. (4+1) and B.Arch (5+1).
    * The MSSD program supports the sequential completion of two graduate degrees within an expedited timeframe. Students with interdisciplinary academic interests can complete an additional [graduate degree](https://www.architecture.cmu.edu/graduate-programs) within the School of Architecture by double-counting up to 48 units across both programs, which accelerates the overall timeline. The programs must be completed sequentially. Interested students should apply to the additional program during their final year in the MSSD program and are strongly encouraged to coordinate their course scheduling with both programs' Track Chairs early on. (Examples: MSSD + M.Arch; MSSD + MSCD; MSSD + MUD; and others)


  * Graduation Requirements 
In addition to the standard requirements for all graduate students in the School of Architecture, students in the MSSD program must satisfy the following:
    * MSSD students must complete a minimum of 159 coursework units, including completion of the 36-unit _Sustainable Design Synthesis_.
    * _PREREQUISITE COURSES:_ The prerequisite courses offer foundational knowledge for students not exposed to the early concepts of sustainability (48-635 Enviro 1) and computational design, representation and parametric modeling (48-689 Design Skills Workshop). Students with previous experience in these areas are encouraged to seek exemption from the prerequisite courses.
    * _CORE COURSES_ MSSD students must complete core courses as per the curriculum chart. The program Track Chair must approve any core course substitutions.
    * _SELECTIVE COURSES_ MSSD students must take at least one (1) selective course from each of the program’s focus curricular categories, with a cumulative total of 36 units across all categories. A list of pre-approved [core selectives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1an9evMLgoDGAFwz9mAwlR21FKOIf1l_X/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107229981582806194379&rtpof=true&sd=true) is provided. Students can request to add additional selectives with approval from the Track Chair. There are three (3) program categories for Selective Courses:
      * Category 1 | TOOLS and METHODS
      * Category 2 | ECOLOGICAL IMPACT
      * Category 3 | DESIGN and OPERATIONS
    * Applicants with significant experience may apply for [advanced standing](https://live-cmu-soa-2023.pantheonsite.io/sites/default/files/2024-07/MSSD_curriculum_APPLIED_3_2024-25%20semesters.pdf) in the program upon admission.
    * Changes to curricular offerings take place regularly. Visit the [CMU Schedule of Classes](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet/search) for the up-to-date course listing.
