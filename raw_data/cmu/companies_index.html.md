# Demand for Software Engineers Surges!
Hiring top software engineering talent will become increasingly harder as demand surges across all sectors. While the past decade has seen an uptick in big data and data science, the real cost is in building reliable systems to meet your company’s need to keep innovating.
The demand for software engineers will skyrocket by 21% during 2018-2028, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics! That's over 284,100 new jobs in software development. Moreover, the number of less experienced computer programmer positions will decline by 7%, that's -17,900 jobs.
In a [recent New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/technology/computer-science-courses-college.html), students are rushing to computer science majors more than doubling enrollment between 2013-2017. Yet, Universities cannot produce instructors fast enough to meet demand. How will your company compete for an ever shrinking talent pool?
