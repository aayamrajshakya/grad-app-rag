# Master of Language Technologies: Integrated Study
The Master of Language Technologies: Integrated Studies (5LT) program is a 5th year research-oriented program for SCS undergraduate students who have shown interest and aptitude in language technologies. 
## Overview
The 5[](https://lti.cs.cmu.edu/mlt/) provides CMU SCS Undergraduate students the opportunity to explore the many options related to language technologies for a research career in academia or industry. In this program, you’ll be immersed in research for 1 full year. The program consists of a 4 year Bachelors degree plus 1 year Masters degree completion. During the academic year, your time will be evenly split between taking courses and doing research with your faculty advisor. Your 5th year summer will be devoted entirely to research. 
## Requirements
The 5LT program lasts one year (12 months), and students must complete one summer of research. Students should usually expect to graduate in August of their fifth year.
5LT students take 96 or more course units (about 8 courses, with 2 of those courses taken typically during undgrad), at least 72 of which are LTI courses, and 24 of which are School of Computer Science (SCS) courses. Most of these are 12-unit courses, although lab courses are typically 6 units. Our courses generally assume knowledge of programming and data structures. The remaining units may also be taken from the LTI, or with approval from the faculty advisor, any other senior- or graduate-level course offered at CMU or Pitt.
Directed research is another integral part of the 5LT program; 5LT students carry out directed research during their studies, with guidance from their faculty advisors.
## Curriculum
Here's an example of how your one year in the 5LT program may break down.
|  Fall |  Spring |  Summer  
---|---|---|---  
Year 1 |  Grammars and Lexicons Algorithms for NLP Speech Understanding Directed Study |  Search Engines or Machine Learning for Text Mining Machine Translation Computational Semantics for NLP Directed Study |  Required Research
