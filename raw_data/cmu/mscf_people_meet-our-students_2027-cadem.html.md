## Bio
Cade spent 3 years at UCLA, earning a B.S. in Data Theory, a joint major between the mathematics and statistics departments. He previously interned at Wells Fargo, where he built databases to improve risk testing efficiency for the Consumer Lending Risk team, and at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, where he optimized data pipelines and developed control system interfaces for particle accelerator operations. He has conducted research in the UCLA Department of Mathematics on optimization techniques for noisy and underdetermined Radon transforms. With a strong foundation in math, statistics, and applied data science, and a love for high-stress, fast-paced environments, Cade is eager to apply his skill set toward a career in trading or research.
