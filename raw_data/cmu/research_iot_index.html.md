## Building secure and private IoT systems
The Internet of Things (IoT) is reaching critical mass in many sectors of the economy, with the prevalence of IoT devices creating significant challenges for the safety, security, reliability, and privacy of consumers and enterprises that use them. Companies currently spend billions on enterprise IoT lifecycle management, but still struggle with security and privacy vulnerabilities, service disruptions, and costly, inefficient, and ineffective remediation methods. Consumers love the convenience of IoT devices, but are increasingly concerned that personally identifiable information is being collected, and that this information may be stolen or misused.
It is increasingly evident that current approaches are ill-equipped to address the security and privacy challenges that will arise in IoT deployments on several dimensions:
Scalability
Speed and Cost: Identifying and remediating security vulnerabilities remains largely based upon human effort, thus operates at human-speed of days / months / years – and at human cost. This needs to be automatic, autonomous – taking only seconds or minutes. 
Safety and Security
Uptime and Reliability
Compliance
