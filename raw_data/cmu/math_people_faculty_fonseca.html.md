#  Research 
My primary focus is on research and training in applied mathematics at the broad interface between mathematics, the physical sciences and engineering. My research program includes the mathematical study of shape memory alloys, ferroelectric, magnetic materials, composites, thin structures, phase transitions in fluids and solids, and the mathematical analysis of image segmentation, denoising, detexturing and recolorization in computer vision.
