# FAQ
**What if my undergraduate degree is not in computer science or engineering?**
The admissions committee will look at your background holistically, both education and industry. If you do not have a degree in computer science or other engineering-related field, you may still be eligible for the program but it will be important for you to show the committee that you have knowledge in some of the foundational disciplines such as data structures and algorithms and discrete math. You may want to address this in your Statement of Purpose or Video Essay.
## “In order to be successful and rise to the top in any organization, you eventually have to know how to get things done not just through your own efforts but through other team members as well. Learning how to leverage human and technical resources in the course of a software development project is something the program teaches extraordinarily well.”
