## Challenging Boundaries through Research
We are agents of change, and we challenge the traditional boundaries of the arts through practice, research, solo endeavors and vibrant collaborations — within CFA, across Carnegie Mellon University and with colleagues around the world. We believe it is necessary to view all that we do as part of a research umbrella; creative practice, after all, is a form of research in and of itself.
## Constructing Creative Change
Our research and creative practice efforts span the depth and breadth of societal concerns, each one making its mark upon the world. Our work most often occurs outside a laboratory; we are not defined by parameters and standard explanation. This approach allows us to make a difference in a wide variety of subject areas, such as: health & wellness; sustainability & design ecologies; artificial intelligence & machine learning; mixed reality & emerging tech; and artistic endeavors.

## The Arts + Tech + More
You may find within CFA’s research and creative practice projects things like works of art, new music and playwriting, new building systems and new platforms for expression. At the same time, our faculty, staff and students delve into research topics like advancements in urban living, social-innovation initiatives, and NSF-funded scientific work in technology and neuroscience. You’ve likely heard about the “intersection of the arts and technology.” That’s happening here.
## Thinking Local, Making Global
Here in CFA, research, creative practice and innovation are critical parts of our educational efforts. Faculty, staff and students are actively involved in vital research that bears fruit for our campus community and for our local, regional, national and international communities.
