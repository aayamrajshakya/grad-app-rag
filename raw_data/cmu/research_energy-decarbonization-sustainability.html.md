# Energy, decarbonization, and sustainability
Our research combines computational work on process design, optimization, fluid dynamics, and machine learning with experimental work in catalysis and renewable polymers. Students contribute to the development of:
  * low and net zero carbon solutions that are able to ensure access to affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy for all
  * pathways for industrial decarbonization and carbon dioxide removal technologies


Projects include:
  * electrification with modern intermittent sources (wind and solar)
  * carbon capture utilization and sequestration
  * the development of novel chemicals and production pathways based on low carbon, renewable, and recycled feedstocks
  * the design of novel catalysts


## Sample research projects
* ### Sampriti Chattopadhyay
My current study addresses the challenge of determining the optimal retrofit decarbonization strategy for existing fossil-based refineries. Starting from a process flowsheet representing current operations in the industry, I incorporate decarbonization alternatives into a comprehensive superstructure. By using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to optimize the superstructure, the research identifies a cost-effective decarbonization plan that enables meeting emission targets set by the company. The results provide valuable insights into the economic feasibility of retrofit electrification strategies.

* ### Cheick Dosso
I develop computational fluid dynamics models and math programming frameworks to optimize carbon capture processes using membranes. Ultimately, this research aims to make carbon capture more efficient and affordable, supporting cleaner energy production.

* ### Chris Laliwala
I use superstructure optimization to design sustainable processes to recover rare earth elements (REE) from end-of-life products. As the US advances in the decarbonization of the economy, a sevenfold increase in REE demand is expected. Their recovery from electronic waste is potentially advantageous from both economic and environmental standpoints when compared to traditional mining. My research aims to quantify these advantages and find the optimal processing pathways.

* ### Sunny Surprenant
My research goal is to integrate well-known chemistries used in petroleum-based polymers and bioconjugation to manipulate material properties and recyclability in biopolymer design. Agricultural proteins, such as keratin, whey, and zein, have recently been investigated as renewable feedstock in polymer manufacturing. These proteins, though brittle and dry on their own, have been shown to add to mechanical strength and possibly aid in biodegradability.

* ### Abdul Ahmed
My research focuses on developing methodologies and frameworks that characterize and quantify the circularity of individual processes and supply chains. As a case study, I am currently evaluating the value chain of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common consumer single-use plastic and the main component of polyester textiles.
