# Employing Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Policy Analysis
## Course Number: 84-703 
Employing Qualitative and Quantitative Methods in Policy Analysis, will provide a qualitative understanding of quantitative methods in the professional context of policy analysis. Skillsets to be developed in this course are the analysis and visualization of data along with overviewing predictive causal inferences and the logical frameworks that underscore this work. In addition, students will gain necessary experience with descriptive statistics, regression modeling, and others– especially any practice that seeks to provide empirical evidence of causal relationships. Case studies and examples will be taken from the literature in IR and security studies. Students will be expected to achieve a level of understanding commensurate with critically consuming studies that use these methods, collaborating effectively with statisticians that can implement these methods, and partnering on designing studies and data collection regimes that will lead to compelling empirical research.
