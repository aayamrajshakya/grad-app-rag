# Rankings
There’s no one “best” program, but MBA rankings can help you compare programs and feel confident that a Tepper School MBA will advance your career.
  
Several publications including [U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/rankings), [Financial Times](https://rankings.ft.com/business-education/masters-in-business-administration), [Businessweek](https://www.bloomberg.com/business-schools/regions/us/), and more publish rankings of our programs at the Tepper School of Business. Rankings are based on a combination of factors, including publicly available data, data submitted by schools (career outcomes, graduation rates, tuition rates, research production) and surveys of alumni, students, staff, and employers.
These surveys have an impact on the Tepper School’s brand and prestige, so if you are a Tepper School alumni and receive a survey from Businessweek, Financial Times, or Poets&Quants, please use that opportunity to share about the world class experience that the Tepper School of Business provides for its students.
