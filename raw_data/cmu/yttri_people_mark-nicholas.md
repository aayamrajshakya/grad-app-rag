I am interested in how the brain is able to make decisions and execute those decisions via movement. Using a combination of complex behavior, in vivo extracellular electrophysiology, and computational modeling, my current research is focused on how motor cortex and striatum work together to produce skilled motor actions.
I have been working with Eric since the beginning of the lab in 2017 and started my PhD studies in 2020. Previously I trained under Dr. Betsy Murray at the National Institute of Mental Health where I studied learning, value representation and decision making. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2015 with a B.S. in Neuroscience where I trained under Dr. Sandra Kuhlman.
If I am at my desk in lab, I will most likely be casting a soccer game on the projector in the common space. Outside of the lab, I enjoy cooking and exploring the parks of Pittsburgh with my dog Woody.
