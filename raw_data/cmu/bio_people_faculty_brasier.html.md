# Programs & Outreach
I am advisor for [The Sciences Teaching Club](https://thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/sciences-teaching-club), [NeuroSAC](http://www.cmu.edu/neuro/neurosac/index.html), and the [Nu Rho Psi Honor Society](https://thebridge.cmu.edu/organization/NuRhoPsi).  
  
In working with students to get them involved in understanding how scientists ask questions, think about problems, and communicate their results, I also serve as CMU's faculty advisor to a team of reviewers who work for [IMPULSE: The Premier Undergraduate Neuroscience Journal](https://impulse.appstate.edu/). In working with undergraduate students, I help them to publish their results in IMPULSE or in other peer-reviewed journals.
