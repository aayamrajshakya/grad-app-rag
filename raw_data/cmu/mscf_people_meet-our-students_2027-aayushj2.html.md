## Bio
Hi, I'm Aayush - a Master's student in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University and a recent graduate in Mathematics and Computing with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence from IIT Kharagpur.  
  
I bring a strong foundation in math, finance, and programming, built through challenging coursework, competitive hackathons like the WorldQuant Alpha Making Challenge and Amex Campus Superbowl, and an internship as a Quantitative Strategist at Goldman Sachs.  
  
I enjoy solving complex financial problems using data-driven, algorithmic methods. I'm excited by fast markets, hard problems, and working with sharp teams. My background in AI helps me approach trading and research with both speed and structure.  
  
I'm currently seeking a Summer 2026 internship in Sales & Trading, Quant Trading, Portfolio Management, or Quant Research at a hedge fund or prop trading firm. I'm especially drawn to front-office roles where I can take initiative, grow from feedback, and contribute to real-time decision-making.  
  
I'll bring curiosity, strong technical skills, and a focus on impact to your team. I'm eager to keep learning, stay sharp under pressure, and deliver real value from day one.  
  
I'm available to meet on Zoom or in person at your convenience to discuss how I can help your team succeed.
