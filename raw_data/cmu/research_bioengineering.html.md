# Bioengineering
From spinal cord stimulation to cryopreservation, our experts are finding solutions for human health issues.
## Bioengineering
* ### Biomechanics
Our experts investigate biomechanics at the molecular, cellular, and human body scales.
Their work includes exploring myosin protein for synthetic muscle, using DNA origami for nanomechanics of multiprotein systems, developing robotic interfaces for microsurgery, and making bio-inspired robots. They pair wearable medical devices with advanced analytics and machine learning to personalize rehabilitation for joint injuries and pathologies. They investigate the physiological mechanisms underlying sensory perception, feedback control of movement, and neuroplasticity in sensorimotor systems.
