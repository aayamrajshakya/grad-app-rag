The Carnegie Mellon School of Music firmly believes that service to the university student in a field of study outside of the school is critical to meeting its larger mission. Extending high-quality training to those who will be future arts consumers and amateur practitioners is crucial to the growth and health of the art of music. In addition, sharing the intrinsic value of music training to students in other fields enriches their undergraduate education.
The Music Extension Division serves Carnegie Mellon students who are not music majors but who are seeking to start or further their musical training. Studio lessons from practicing professionals are available at all levels from beginner to advanced. For beginning students, the focus is on building a strong technical foundation with attention to reading, basic theory, and technique. Intermediate and advanced students will encounter a curriculum tailored to their specific skill level and goals. The Music Extension Division is also a way of preparing non-music majors for auditions into the music minor or music major programs, or to prepare for external competitions.
Students are expected to participate and prepare for each lesson according to guidelines designated by each instructor. Instructors discuss grading criteria based on skill level and experience at the outset of every semester. Students are invited to participate in an end of the semester recital. At the discretion of the studio teacher, this performance may be required of a more advanced student.

## Courses:
## Beginning Piano (57-103/4)

## Jazz Piano I (57-105)
Jazz Piano I is a small, hands-on class for students wishing to learn or improve their jazz piano improvisation skills. Students must be proficient on the piano. A working knowledge of music theory is preferable. Class size is limited to 6 students. Must have instructor approval.
## Jazz Piano II (57-109)
Jazz Piano II is a small, hands-on class for advanced jazz piano students. Students must have taken and or placed out of Jazz Piano I. Class size is limited to 6 students. Must have instructor approval.
## Group Guitar (57-109)
Using classical and jazz guitar methods, this course is designed to provide a basic set of techniques that will allow students to pursue the avenue of guitar playing that most interests them. While emphasis will be on developing skills in playing the guitar, a basic understanding of the principles of music theory as applied to the guitar will also be acquired. While few students will find it possible to master all of the materials presented, an exposure to the many possibilities of musical expression available on the guitar and an understanding of basic music theory will help to broaden the students’ perspective and make future musical experiences, such as listening and performing, more rewarding. Students are expected to have their own instrument. A guitar in good working condition is essential. An acoustic classical or steel string is preferred, an electric with a small battery operated amp is acceptable. Students having no previous training on the guitar will find this class most valuable.
