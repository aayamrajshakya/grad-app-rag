CyLab is leading a number of other [research centers](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/centers/index.html) ranging from biometrics, privacy, to visual intelligence. Learn about our other research centers.
Topically, CyLab is currently focusing on 15 research areas related to security and privacy, shown at the top of this page.
## Learn more about our research
To get security and privacy right, researchers in Carnegie Mellon University CyLab[policy ideas](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/about/public-policy.html) that power the network safety of private and public enterprises. Security and privacy affects every walk of life, from the operator ensuring the resiliency of a city’s electric grid to a child learning to read using a tablet.
Many pieces of CyLab’s research result in new tools, open-sourced code, or other technologies to help increase the security and privacy of our digital world. [Check out some featured CyLab demos.](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/research/demos.html)
