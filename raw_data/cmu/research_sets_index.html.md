## SETS research
## Example SETS research projects
* ### Center of Excellence (COE) in New Mobility and Automated Vehicles
The [COE in New Mobility and Automated Vehicles](https://www.mobilitycoe.org/) will focus on the three cardinal technological trends shaping "new mobility": connectivity, automation, and electrification. These, in conjunction with innovative shared-use models and various other business strategies, constitute a vast spectrum of new mobility technologies and services set to revolutionize surface transportation. Examples of such transformative technologies and services include connected automated vehicles, cooperative driving automation, smart infrastructure (e.g., edge AI), along with services such as electric bike and scooter Sharing and Mobility as a Service (MaaS) platforms.

* ### A Digital Twin Virtual Testbed for Sustainable and Equitable Autonomous Food Delivery
This project aims to develop a digital twin virtual testbed for simulating food delivery using trucks, sidewalk robots, and drones. This tool will help state and local agencies set equitable policies on sidewalk right-of-way, pricing, and safety regulation, and enable food delivery services to assess how different distribution models impact costs, fresh food access, energy use, emissions, and profitability across various neighborhoods.
Faculty: [Corey Harper](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/harper-corey.html)
* ### Optimizing Mobility Subsidies and Infrastructure in Multimodal Transportation Networks
Researchers look to optimize the allocation of mobility subsidies and infrastructure investments across urban areas to address spatial biases in current network designs. By leveraging a flexible multimodal network computational model, the research aims to ensure equitable access to essential services through improved distribution of shared bikes, e-scooters, and transportation network vehicles.
Faculty: [Katherine Flanigan](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/flanigan-katherine.html), [Sean Qian](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/qian-sean.html)
* ### Disaster Recovery and Response Innovation through Fuel Cell Deployment
This project explores using modular micro-grids with solid-oxide fuel cells to enhance community resilience to power outages caused by natural disasters. The research combines economic analysis, electricity planning, and operations research to evaluate the effectiveness of decentralized infrastructure in improving disaster response, reducing outage times, and supporting essential services, particularly for low-income populations.
Faculty: [Destinie Nock](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/nock-destenie.html)
* ### Probabilistic Network Flow Theory: Embracing Emerging Big Data for Efficient, Reliable and Sustainable Multi-model Transportation Systems
Students and faculty are developing a mathematical framework for transportation system modeling using large-scale multi-source data. By analyzing travel demand patterns and network disruptions, the research supports decision-making in transportation planning and operations. Collaborating with public and private sectors, the project will develop open-source models and algorithms to advance data-driven transportation science.
Faculty: [Sean Qian](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/qian-sean.html)
* ### Predictive Real-Time Traffic Management in Large-Scale Networks Using Model-Based Artificial Intelligence
This project develops AI-based theories and algorithms to predict and manage non-recurrent traffic conditions in large-scale networks. By leveraging transportation network flow models, the research aims to forecast traffic incidents 30 minutes ahead and recommend proactive operational strategies, validated through case studies in both small and large-scale networks.
Faculty: [Sean Qian](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/qian-sean.html)
* ### Equity and Sustainability: A Framework for Equitable Energy Transition Analyses
This research investigates the transition to renewable energy in the US electricity sector with a focus on social equity and sustainability. It integrates sustainability and electricity system models, assesses regional cooperation's role in decarbonization, and incorporates social equity metrics. The project will also develop an open-source tool to support national discussions and job recovery planning related to the energy transition.
Faculty: [Destenie Nock](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/nock-destenie.html)
* ### Developing an Equity-Focused Planning Tool for Transit and Bike Share Systems
This study aims to create a replicable model to measure and enhance equity in transit and bike-share systems. By considering stakeholder preferences, network connectivity, and budget constraints, the model will help improve transportation access and mobility for underserved populations, particularly in areas where traditional transit options are limited.
