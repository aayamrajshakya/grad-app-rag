## Bio
Paul K. Eiss is an associate professor of anthropology and history in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of History. He has conducted extensive archival and ethnographic research in Mexico. Eiss is currently pursuing three research projects. The first examines practices and rhetoric of collective violence and collective self-defense in contemporary Mexico. The second is a study of mestizaje and performance in Yucatán—and particularly in Yucatecan teatro regional—from the early 19th century to the present. The third is a study of indigeneity, translation, and the politics of memory in revolutionary and post-revolutionary Yucatán.
