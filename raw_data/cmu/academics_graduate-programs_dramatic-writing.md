# Dramatic Writing
## Elevate Your Craft
Carnegie Mellon’s dramatic writing program offers unparalleled industry connections and professional channels for aspiring stage and screen writers. Emphasizing a disciplined daily writing practice, the program provides opportunities to design and teach undergraduate classes while benefiting from an astonishing guest faculty and a strong alumni network. A focus on the life of a professional writer is one of the distinguishing characteristics of this degree.
The MFA program partners with the [Playwrights’ Center](https://pwcenter.org/) in Minneapolis and the [Dramatists Guild](https://www.dramatistsguild.com/) to provide free memberships, connecting the cohort with the most comprehensive databases of production and development opportunities for plays and playwrights, as well as labor and legal support. Career-advancement awards, special to the cohort, are provided through an initiative with the [Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](https://sloan.org/), which awards $45,000 each year to current CMU writers.
### Dramatic Writing Curriculum
The rigorous curriculum centers writing as a daily practice. Courses include advanced playwriting and screenwriting, pedagogical training, and a focus on equitable practices in theater. Students gain hands-on experience through a writer/designer project, teaching practicums, and new play development, all designed to refine their craft and prepare them for diverse professional opportunities.
Guest faculty are a vital presence in the program; recent guests have included Mojisola Adebayo, Eisa Davis, Jessica Dickey, Lisa Sanaye Dring, Alesia Etinoff, Gracie Gardner, Aleshea Harris, Julia Izumi, Aurorae Khoo, Carlos Murillo, Jiehae Park, Cori Thomas, Mfoniso Udofia, and Josh Wilder.
