## Bio
My name is Yujie Zhu, and I graduated from the University of Waterloo in April 2025 with a major in Mathematics/Financial Analysis and Risk Management. Throughout my undergraduate journey and two years of co-op experience across investment management, risk analytics, insurance, technology, and IT, I developed a strong interest in applying quantitative methods to solve complex financial problems. My academic background provided a solid foundation in statistics, financial theory, and quantitative modelling, while my industry experience exposed me to real-world applications such as portfolio optimization, fixed income risk analytics, and credit risk evaluation. These roles sharpened my technical skills in Python, R, SQL, and Excel/VBA, and reinforced my passion for risk management and data-driven decision-making. In addition, my role as an Investment and Project Manager in a startup enhanced my ability to work under uncertainty, lead initiatives, and integrate analytical insights into business strategy. I enjoy working at the intersection of math, finance, and innovation, particularly in environments that require critical thinking and model-driven decision support. I am actively seeking opportunities in quantitative research or financial risk management where I can contribute to building robust, insight-driven financial strategies.
