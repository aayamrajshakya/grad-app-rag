## Bio
What will it take to become an excellent quant researcher? The MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon University will provide students with the necessary tools and knowledge to enter the quant research field. However, skills and traits such as a drive for problem-solving, an ability to manage time efficiently, and an unrelenting spirit will be necessary for success once there. Kushaan Jain excels in these areas, which is why he can help your organization prosper.  
  
Having originally graduated from the Computing and Financial Management program at the University of Waterloo (with Dean's Honours), he has built a strong foundation in data-driven programming and statistical model development. Alongside the pursuit of his two majors, he pushed himself to complete a minor in Economics to be able to understand business issues through a macro lens. During his time there, he also engaged in multiple diverse work opportunities, including working in data analytics for the Ontario government and as a DevOps developer for a SaaS company. His most notable experiences include working in the asset management side of insurance companies, such as AIA Hong Kong and Equitable Life of Canada. He advised on company-level investment proposals by employing his experience in Python and Excel, and configured expansive investment databases to streamline trading processes. He joined the MSCF program to refine and strengthen his quantitative finance skills such that he can triumph as a quant researcher.  
  
He is available to chat via Zoom, phone, or face-to-face to prove how he can help your organization.
