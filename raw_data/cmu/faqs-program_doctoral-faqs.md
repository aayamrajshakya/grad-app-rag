# Doctoral Program FAQs
## Doctoral Program FAQs
  * I have a background in a specialized area related to design (illustration, photography, fine art, engineering, fashion, textiles, advertising, etc.). Does experience or a degree in this area meet the design qualification of the PhD?
Candidates should have backgrounds in one of the School of Design's area of focus (Communication Design, Product Design, Interaction Design, UX design, Environments Design, Service Design, Design for Social Innovation, design research, design theory). Please contact us for advice on this matter.
  * I’m interested in undertaking doctoral research in Digital Interaction Design. Should I apply to this program?
No. The Human Computer Interaction Institute offers a PhD with pathways in Interaction Design. Consequently, applicants with research topics and approaches that demand significant amounts of coding or more cognitive science based research methods will be encouraged to apply to HCII.
  * I have been working as a professional interaction/communication/product/service/social innovation/environments designer for 3+ years but I don’t have a master’s degree in design. Can I apply to the PhD program?
In some cases, 3+ years of high-level professional design experience, demonstrated with a portfolio and a well-formulated research proposal may meet the application requirements.
  * I come from a background in business and management but am interested in conducting research in Transition Design. Should I apply?
In some cases, yes. Applicants with backgrounds in Business and Management, but with additional expertise and experience in Design, and who are interested in Transition Design, should apply to this program and will be encouraged to seek faculty advisers from other areas on campus. We would be particularly interested in candidates with business and management expertise related to Transition Design such as circular economies, sustainable design, and B corps.
  * What if my areas of research are outside the expertise of the School of Design faculty?
Carnegie Mellon is a highly ranked research university and there are potential advisors from a wide range of disciplines on the campus. We also have a network of potential advisors who are based in other institutions.
  * I am not a native English speaker, but my English is very good. Can you waive the language requirements for my application to the PhD program?
The application language proficiency requirements cannot be waived for prior study or work in the U.S. 
  * Before I put time and energy into the application can I send you some examples of my work and have you tell me if you think I will be accepted into the program?
No. Unfortunately we do not have the ability to review portfolio materials for each inquiry that we receive. To be considered for the program you will need to formally apply.
  * Do you offer a part-time PhD or one that I can complete via ‘distance/online learning’?
No. We do not currently offer an online option for our PhD degree. We hope to eventually offer a part time PhD degree but it is not an option at this time.
  * Do you offer partial or fully funded scholarships for your PhD program?
The School of Design does not offer fully funded scholarships. CMU’s Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs administers some of the [financial support](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/funding/index.html) that is available to graduate students and eligible PhD students who enroll in CMU’s Student Health Insurance Plan will receive a credit for the full cost of the individual medical premium fee.
  * Do you offer a Teaching Fellowship?
The School of Design is suspending the Teaching Fellowships for the time being. This means that candidates will need to find external sources of funding for the duration of the program. This would apply to domestic and U.S. visa sponsored candidates who wish to continue their employment whilst also undertaking PhD research and keep the flexibility to study in a low-residency mode once the first year of coursework is complete in Pittsburgh. Due to immigration regulations we cannot offer visa sponsorship for a low-residency program.
  * What documentation is required in GradCAS for my application to be reviewed by the Admissions Committee?
The application requires the following: official transcripts, a portfolio of your work, a brief essay response to a given prompt, 3 recommendation letters, the $75 GradCAS application fee. The English language test result (TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo) and transcript verification (WES or ECE) is also required if you have visa sponsorship. We do not waive any of these GradCAS application requirements. All documentation should be received by GradCAS by February 28, 11:59 pm EST.
