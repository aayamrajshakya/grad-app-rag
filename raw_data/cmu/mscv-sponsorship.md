# Master of Science – Computer Vision (MSCV) Sponsorship
The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University is pleased to offer a Master of Science in Computer Vision (MSCV). The MSCV’s rigorous and focused core curriculum will teach students to apply mathematical and machine learning tools, such as geometry, optimization, and statistics, to computer vision applications. Further learning is obtained through elective courses, an internship, and a hands-on team project. The MSCV project allows students to apply the skills they are learning in the classroom to a real-world scenario. To complete the MSCV requirements, each student shall complete a capstone course project.
_To find exciting and dynamic projects, we are seeking the partnership of industry sponsors._
Sponsor a Project
The capstone course project is a unique opportunity for MSCV students to become directly involved with technologies that are relevant to companies that are sponsoring the capstone project.
The capstone course project spans two semesters and is structured to cover the end-to-end process of a research and development product cycle, while working closely with a project sponsor. Working in teams, students will develop a project involving an actual experience working in computer vision technology that may be of interest to the sponsor. The goal is for students to apply all the skills obtained from the MSCV program to a project that is reflective of an actual experience in a research/design/development setting.
The cost of sponsoring a project is $15,000 per student. Each team has a minimum of 2 students (i.e. minimum of $30,000 per project).
The Student Teams
Each team is composed of 2-3 MSCV students.  
Each team is matched with a course sponsor based on:
  * student preference
  * student skill-set and academic background
  * overall fit


The Faculty
Two to three Carnegie Mellon MSCV faculty members mentor/advise the student projects. The faculty will meet with each team on a regular basis and provide ongoing lectures throughout the semesters. The faculty will help the students set scope, manage time, and ease communication within the student team and between the team and their industry sponsor.
The Work
The first semester (January-May) focuses on getting to know the project sponsor, setting the scope of the project, secondary research (e.g., competitive analysis, demographics), and user research. At the end of the first semester, students will present their findings, which may include, among other things, a documented report, photographs, videos, field notes, models, and frameworks.
The second semester (August-December) includes an ideation phase, where the objective is for students to use their data to design a prototype that meets the needs, desires, and problems of the users. The goal is that by the end of the semester, the students will have finished programming and testing that design, which should be put through at least three iterative phases. As the end of the second semester, the team will present the results of its work which may include a designed, developed and tested prototype in a public forum.
Agreements
To proceed with the sponsorship of a capstone course project, Carnegie Mellon and the project sponsor will enter into the “[Carnegie Mellon University Educational Project Agreement](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/app/uploads/2021/10/Educational-Project-Agreement-EPA-Template.docx)”. This Agreement sets out the terms for the sponsorship of the capstone project between the sponsor and Carnegie Mellon. In addition, each student will sign a Participation Agreement that clearly informs the student of his/her rights and obligations in the project. These template documents are on the website for the MSCV capstone projects.
Intellectual Property
Carnegie Mellon University is a non-profit organization. It is Carnegie Mellon’s policy that the students own all intellectual property they develop in their work on this capstone course. The student, however, may grant the course sponsor additional rights to the intellectual property developed by the student in the conduct of the course.
