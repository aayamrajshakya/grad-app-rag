# Energy Core
[](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/info/4core-all.jpg)Four required energy core mini-courses provide the foundation for understanding all aspects of interdisciplinary energy engineering, especially energy supply, conversion, transport, storage, demand, utilization, policy, and economics. The inter-relationships of these topics are discussed throughout the core, as are current topics connecting them. All degrees in EST&P build up from these core topics. Also in the core courses, students participate in multidisciplinary teams to understand and develop solutions to energy problems, present results and write reports, engage in active discussions with faculty and your fellow students.

[39-610 Energy Conversion and Supply (6 units - A1)](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/energy-core/39-610.html "39-610 course+syllabus")  
[39-613 Energy Transport and Storage (6 units - A2)](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/energy-core/39-613.html "39-613 course+syllabus")  
[39-611 Energy Demand and Utilization (6 units - A3)](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/energy-core/39-611.html "39-611 course+syllabus")  
[39-612 Energy Policy and Economics (6 units - A4)](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/energy-core/39-612.html "39-612 course+syllabus")
As part of strategic partnerships with other CMU programs, selected non-EST&P students also participate in the energy core courses. These include graduate students from our partner departments within the College of Engineering, from the Heinz College [Public Policy & Management Program](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-public-policy-management/public-policy-management-msppm/concentrations/energy-systems-and-public-policy/index.aspx "Heinz College- ES&PP") ([Energy Systems & Public Policy Concentration](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/public-policy-management-master/concentrations)), from the [Tepper School of Business](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/index.html) ([Energy and Sustainability MBA Track](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/curriculum/tracks/energy-business-track.html)).
