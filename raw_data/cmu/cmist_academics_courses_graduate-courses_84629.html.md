# Asian Strategies
## Course Number: 84-629 
What are the strategies of leading Asian countries? How do they intend to pursue their economic, political, and military goals in the years ahead? What role will technology and information play in advancing their strategic objectives? These questions are the heart of this mini-course, focusing on some of the most problematic and promising regional states: North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, and India. While all these actors have a rich history, they were born anew within five years after 1945, with the conclusion of the Second World War, the division of the Korean peninsula, the partition and independence of India, and the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The course will culminate in a discussion of strategic convergences and the divergences, and the implications of national strategies for regional and global peace and stability.
