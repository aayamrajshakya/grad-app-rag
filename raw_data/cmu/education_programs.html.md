Carnegie Mellon University has been designated as a National Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in three distinct areas, Information Assurance/Cyber Defense Education (CAE-IA/CD), Information Assurance/Cyber Defense Research (CAE-R) and Cyber Operations (CAE-Cyber Ops).
Across the colleges and schools at Carnegie Mellon, a number of professional graduate degree programs are offered in information networking, information security, and information technology, to create a pool of professionals who can address the wide range of technology, policy, and management issues in government, industry, and academia.
Several colleges and departments at Carnegie Mellon offer Ph.D. programs which provide many of the faculty and graduate students active engagement in CyLab research. These include the School of Computer Science and the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Engineering and Public Policy, both from the College of Engineering.
## Master’s programs
  * The [Artificial Intelligence Engineering - Information Security (MSAIE-IS)](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/msaie-is/index.html) degree enables students to gain a deep understanding of AI methods, systems, tool chains and cross-cutting issues, including security, privacy and other ethical, societal and policy challenges. Students will apply AI to the design and implementation of information security systems, including networks, software and services.
  * The [Master of Science in Information Security (MSIS)](http://www.ini.cmu.edu/degrees/msis/index.html) degree offers a technical focus in security and computer systems, further developed through research opportunities. Graduates may pursue doctoral degrees or obtain positions as security experts equipped to manage the emerging complexities associated with securing data, networks and systems.
  * [Pittsburgh-Silicon Valley Bicoastal Programs](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/index.html) – Combining the rich, academic setting of CMU's main campus in Pittsburgh with hands-on industry experience in the heart of Silicon Valley, bicoastal information security and mobile and IoT engineering students have the best of both worlds. During their time in Silicon Valley, students gain unparalleled exposure in the nation's top tech hub by participating in hackathons, working alongside industry in the practicum project and networking with leaders in the field. The Information Networking Institute offers two degrees through bicoastal delivery. 
    * The Master of Science in Mobile and IoT Engineering (MSMITE)
    * Master of Science in Information Technology-Information Security (MSIT-IS)
  * The [Master of Science in Privacy Engineering (MS-PE)](https://privacy.cs.cmu.edu/masters/index.html) degree is designed specifically for computer scientists and engineers who want to make an meaningful impact as privacy engineers or technical privacy managers. Students who elect to take a summer internship typically finish the program in 16 months, and those who do not take an internship may finish in 12. All students finish their degree with a Capstone project in which they solve real-world privacy challenges for an outside sponsor. Past sponsors include Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft, and other major names in the technology sector.
  * The [Master of Science in Information Networking (MSIN)](http://www.ini.cmu.edu/degrees/msin/index.html) degree provides an advanced, specialized curriculum combining computer science, electrical and computer engineering, software engineering, and information systems while incorporating business and policy perspectives. Graduates are well positioned to pursue doctoral degrees or obtain leadership, technical, and management positions across an array of sectors and industries.
  * The [Master of Science in Information Security Policy and Management (MSISPM)](http://www.heinz.cmu.edu/school-of-information-systems-and-management/information-security-policy-management-msispm/index.aspx) provides students with background and insights into general and technical coverage of information security, while equipping them with the analytical methods and management practices necessary to succeed as managers in the field of information security. 
  * The [Master of Science in Software Engineering (MS-SE)](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/ms-in-se/index.html) is a unique program offered exclusively at CMU’s [Silicon Valley campus](https://www.sv.cmu.edu/index.html). It emphasizes a rigorous foundation in the principles of software engineering within the context of ECE’s top-ranked Computer Engineering program. Students develop the understanding and skills needed to become the architects and project leaders building systems in which software plays a critical role. The course of study combines a deep core in software engineering principles and practices with application to a series of increasingly complex systems challenges drawn from the real world.
  * Students in [the Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering (MS-ECE)](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/masters/index.html) program are provided with a thorough background in the fundamentals of electrical or computer engineering, as well as the opportunity for in-depth specialization in some particular aspect of these fields. Upon enrollment in the department, students are given the opportunity, with the help of an academic advisor and faculty mentor, to choose an educational program that is consistent with their backgrounds and is best suited to their own academic goals. Learn more about [The Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/admissions/california-bppe.html) (BPPE).
  * The [Master of Science in Engineering and Technology Innovation Management (ETIM)](https://engineering.cmu.edu/etim/) degree program shapes engineers and scientists into world-class leaders in innovation and technology management. Our multi-disciplinary professors and peers teach the specialized business skills, frameworks, and technical acuity necessary to both create and capture value from innovative technologies. In addition to the base program, we offer dual degree options, a part-time track for local professionals, and a unique new degree program that combines the ETIM curriculum with the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning.


## Ph.D. programs
Interested in pursuing a research career in security or privacy, but unsure of which Carnegie Mellon University Ph.D. program to apply to? [Read this article](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/news/2024/11/13-phd-programs.html) for full details and suggestions.
  * [Ph.D. Programs at the School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/doctoral-programs): The School of Computer Science offers numerous programs for doctoral students, including [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/phd-hci), [Machine Learning](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/prospective-students/ml-phd.html "PhD programs in Machine Learning"), [Software Engineering](https://se-phd.s3d.cmu.edu), [Computer Science](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/academics/doctoral/overview#phdoverview), and [Societal Computing](http://sc.cs.cmu.edu/). The doctoral programs differ from each other by their set of course requirements, though there is some overlap of courses between programs. Common to all SCS Ph.D. programs is the priority on research and attention to improving teaching, speaking, and writing skills.
  * [Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)](http://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/phd/index.html): Students in the ECE Ph.D. Program are provided a research-intensive study of the fundamentals of electrical or computer engineering. Students will create and disseminate knowledge of electrical and computer systems during the course of obtaining the Ph.D. degree. Upon enrollment in the department, students, with the help of a faculty advisor, define an education and research program that is consistent with their backgrounds and is best suited to their own academic goals.
  * [Ph.D. in Engineering and Public Policy (EPP)](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/prospective/doctoral-studies/index.html): The Ph.D. program at EPP requires a rigorous program of courses and research. The courses include a series of core classes on fundamental approaches and methods for engineering and public policy; required classes in statistics and economics; electives in engineering, science, and mathematics; and electives in the social sciences. Research experience and efforts begin very early in the academic program, leading to a first research paper of journal quality after the third semester and continuing through the development of subsequent papers and the Ph.D. thesis.
