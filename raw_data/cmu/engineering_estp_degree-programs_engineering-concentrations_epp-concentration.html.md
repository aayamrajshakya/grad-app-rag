# Engineering Concentration in   
Engineering and Public Policy
To complete the Engineering and Public Policy in EPP, students must successfully complete   
36 units of approved EPP graduate-level courses.
  * Pre-approved courses are given in the list below.
  * Appropriate alternative courses must be approved by the EST&P program and the EPP department.

Graduate engineering classes are generally offered once per year, though they may be taught less frequently.  
Mini numbers denote the order of these half-semester sessions: 1 & 2 are in the fall and 3 & 4 in the spring.  
Special Topics classes (S.T.) are new or infrequent classes that may not be regularly scheduled.
