# Research
Research in the Computer Science Department encompasses the foundations, and explores the frontiers of computing science.
## Faculty Research Guide
Our Faculty Research Guide (FRG) is a good starting point to see which faculty are working on some of today's most interesting research challenges.
The work we do here covers a wide range of research interests. Each faculty member has written his or her own research summary, which is available on their individual [CSD directory](https://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/people/faculty "Link to the faculty sublist in the Computer Science Department directory") page.
