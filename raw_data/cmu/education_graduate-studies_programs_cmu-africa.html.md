## Transforming Africa
[Carnegie Mellon University Africa](https://www.africa.engineering.cmu.edu/index.html) is the only U.S. research university offering master’s degrees with full-time faculty, staff, and operations based in Africa. The university is tackling the critical shortage of high-quality engineering talent required to accelerate development in Africa, which has the fastest-growing workforce in the world. The full-time graduate programs are designed to educate future leaders, who will use their hands-on, experiential learning to advance technology innovation and grow businesses that will transform Africa.
CMU-Africa's mission is to deliver transformative educational programs to cultivate future technology leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators across Africa. Applicants must, therefore, be passionate about solving problems on the continent using the education and skills acquired at CMU-Africa.
