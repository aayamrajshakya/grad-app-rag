## Degree overview
In the advanced study degree you have the flexibility to choose from a range of courses to acquire depth in a technical concentration area. You will acquire the ability to work in teams to propose, plan, and execute projects to solve real-world problems through cohort based courses developed for masters students. This degree also provides opportunities to take courses offered by other departments in the College of Engineering, School of Computer Science, and Mellon College of Science.
[Five concentrations are available:](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/masters/ms-advanced-study-concentrations.html)
  * Design and manufacturing of mechanical systems
  * Energy and thermal fluid systems
  * Robotic and control systems
  * Biomechanical Engineering and Medical Devices
  * Self-defined (through petitioning the Department of Mechanical Engineering)


The curriculum goes beyond these specialties by incorporating course work and opportunities to develop and strengthen professional skills in leadership and communications.
