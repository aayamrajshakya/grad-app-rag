## Bio
From a young age, I've chased challenge, visiting 25 countries, trading from three of them, each move a deliberate step outside my comfort zone. This fall, I joined the MSCF program to combine mathematics with an engineer's mindset and craft systematic, real-world solutions.  
  
I want to join a systematic-trading desk where research-driven insight meets end-to-end execution. Working and studying in diverse settings taught me that the most value lies in first spotting the highest impact problems. Seeing the bigger picture and understanding what truly is the bottleneck is a skill I aim to bring to everything I interact with.  
  
I'm a curious builder, understanding the importance of reproducibility and documentation. I like to turn ideas into production, because ideas only count when backed by real "skin in the game." Having lived and worked in India, Singapore, and the Netherlands, I adapt fast to new cultures and can communicate clearly with diverse multicultural teams; I'm looking forward to Pittsburgh being home number four.  
  
I'd be happy to grab a cup of coffee or chat over a Zoom call to discuss more about my experiences or just to learn more about anything interesting!
