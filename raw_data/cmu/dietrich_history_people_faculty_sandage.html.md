Born Losers _[Atlantic Monthly](http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200501)_ magazine and was awarded the 34th Annual Thomas J. Wilson Prize, for the best “first book” accepted by [Harvard University Press](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/SANBOR.html?show=catalogcopy). Three translations of the book came out in 2007, in [Japan](http://www.seidosha.co.jp/index.php?%A1%D6%C9%E9%A4%B1%C1%C8%A1%D7%A4%CE%A5%A2%A5%E1%A5%EA%A5%AB%BB%CB), [Taiwan](https://www.books.com.tw/products/0010378306), and the [People’s Republic of China](https://issuu.com/xiuxiuebook/docs/____________________________________c7762e932a8bd1).
