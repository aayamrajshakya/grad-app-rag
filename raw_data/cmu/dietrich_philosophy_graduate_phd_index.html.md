## Doctorate in Logic, Computation, and Methodology
The LCM Ph.D. is primarily intended for students interested in a career outside of Philosophy, be it academic or in industry.
The program's flexible requirements are geared towards establishing relevant domain specialization (e.g., within mathematics, machine learning, statistics, logic, etc.) while incorporating steady involvement in research and the opportunity to practice the craft of teaching in a top-notch undergraduate environment. Students are expected to complete a Master’s thesis (or obtain a master’s degree from another discipline) by the middle of their third year, and a Ph.D. thesis by the end of their fifth year.
