## Bio
Cleotilde (Coty) Gonzalez is a Research Professor at the [Department of Social and Decision Sciences](http://www.hss.cmu.edu/departments/sds/) at Carnegie Mellon University. She is the founding director of the [Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/ddmlab/) and the research co-director of the [National AI Institute for Societal Decision Making](https://www.cmu.edu/ai-sdm/). She is affiliated with the [CyLab Security and Privacy Institute](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/), [The Human-Computer Interaction Institute](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/), [The Software and Societal Systems Department](https://s3d.cmu.edu/people/faculty-index.html), and [The CNBC Center for Neural Basis of Cognition](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University.  
  
Coty is a lifetime fellow of the [Cognitive Science Society](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/fellows/) and of the [Human Factors and Ergonomics Society](https://www.hfes.org/Membership/Fellows). She is also a member of the Governing Board of the [Cognitive Science Society](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/about/), and a member of the Advisory Committee for the [Division of Behavioral and Social sciences and Education (DBASSE)](https://www.nationalacademies.org/dbasse/about#sl-three-columns-c38e0313-01c3-4515-a54a-9f277af65ced) at the National Academy of Sciences Engineering and Medicine. She is a [Senior Editor for Topics in Cognitive Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/17568765/homepage/editorialboard.html), a [Consulting Editor for Decision](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/dec?tab=2), and [Associate Editor for the System Dynamics Review](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/10991727/homepage/editorialboard.html) and a member of editorial boards in multiple other journals including: [Cognitive Science](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/15516709/homepage/editorialboard.html), [Psychological Review](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/rev?tab=2), [Perspectives on Psychological Science](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/perspectives/editorial-board), and others.  
  
Coty has published hundreds of papers in journals and peer-reviewed proceedings involving a diverse set of fields deriving from her contributions to Cognitive Science. Her work includes the development of a theory of decisions from experience called **Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT)** , from which many computational models have emerged in areas as diverse as: cybersecurity, network science, human-machine teaming, and others. Coty has been Principal or Co-Investigator on a wide range of multi-million and multi-year collaborative efforts with government and industry, including current efforts on NSF AI National Institutes, Multi-University Research Initiative grants from the Army Research Laboratories and Army Research Office; large collaborative projects with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).
## Education
Ph.D.: Texas Tech University
## Research
My research focuses on the study of decision making in dynamic environments. Dynamic decision making is characterized by the need to make multiple, interdependent, real-time decisions while adapting to external changes and using our past experience.
My general research interest is in determining **how decision makers adapt their decisions and learn to make better choices in dynamic situations**. To answer this question, I conduct experimental studies using dynamic decision making games, and computational cognitive modeling to represent the human decision making process. To construct cognitive models, we rely on Instance-Based Learning Theory (IBLT), a theory decisions from experience in dynamic tasks.
