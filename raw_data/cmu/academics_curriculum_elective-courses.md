# Elective Courses
## Fall 2025 Elective Courses
Our electives help our students figure out exactly what it is they want to specialize in, whether that's UX, product design, location-based entertainment, animation, level design, VR design... the list goes on. 
###  53312 - Guest Experience in Theme Park Design
Students will research the history of the Themed Entertainment Industry and study critical phases, including conceptualization, design, building, management, and delivery involved in creating the total themed entertainment experience. 
The class will focus on the importance of creating the total guest experience. Discussions on story and storytelling will address the different aspects of both franchise and original stories. The class will also examine the role of architecture and technology and how they are crafted to enhance the overall guest experience.
Students will explore the importance of communication and collaboration across all disciplines and the high professional standards required in every phase of the entertainment industry. Managing creativity and risk-taking, fostering a culture of team support and trust, developing presentation skills, and providing valuable peer reviews will all be part of the curriculum. 
Students will individually complete various short assignments, research, and presentations. Students will also work in teams made up of multiple disciplines and backgrounds. Assignments will include evaluation of experiences in existing theme parks, proposing a concept for a ride or experience deriving inspiration from a list of options provided by faculty, and developing a design project such as an expansion to an existing theme park, a new restaurant, hotel or other architecture added to an existing complex, a new event or attraction which would include a water, sound and light spectacle, or a large scale Disney parade event. 
Students and faculty will jointly choose design assignments based on the class's needs, interests, and composition. The constantly evolving nature of the industry will provide opportunities for topics of discussion that both faculty and students will identify.

###  53762 - Advanced Look Development: The Two Worlds of Texture
This class will provide students with strategies for creating textures and materials for 3D games or animation assets by focusing on meaningful details. Many texture creation applications offer artists efficient ways to create compelling material networks. While mastering technical procedures is essential, we will apply a deeper understanding of the art and intent behind the techniques to create a more robust visual storytelling experience. 
This course gives students an environment to focus on art and intent by slowing down and zeroing in on the fine point of a physical paintbrush touching a physical model. Students will paint small dioramas, characters, and props using physical model painting. Next, they will digitally recreate and enhance their creators using texture painting software. The course is designed to encourage students to apply the artistic principles of physical model painting to guide the technical texture creation skills on the digital 3D side.

###  53871 - Roleplaying Game Writing Workshop
Role playing games (RPGs) are a vibrant and viable popular medium for interactive storytelling. This workshop builds upon dramatic theory DNA existing in plays, TV and film. Gameplay is performance. The skills developed when creating any time-bound media transfer well to games but must be seen through a different lens - the lens of the player. 
To do so, we will first examine and dissect both RPG story and game design (using pencil and paper examples) seeking an understanding of both game systems as well as narrative best practices. In class, we focus our examination on the most popular existing intellectual property for RPGs: The Lord of the Rings. Students who desire admittance to this class should be at least somewhat familiar with that world to succeed in the class. 
Each student works on a four-person team to create an original RPG campaign-style adventure for an already existing story world. The final product is a portfolio-quality set of dramatic scenes, epic tabletop encounters, and character sketches. This is not an RPG design course. Any level of writing experience is welcome, BUT experience playing RPGs - either tabletop or video game - is a must. Experience as a GM for an RPG is a big plus, and applicants who possess such experience should be sure to let the instructor know in advance.

###  53751 - Research Issues in Game Development: Designing for XR
Extended Reality (or XR) describes the virtual environments generated by the related technologies of Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and Mixed Reality. Each of these generate spatial experiences that hold varying levels of immersion that can enhance or replace our perception of the real world, and each bring their own advantages and limitations. With consumer-grade XR devices readily available, video game companies are creating content but are faced with the challenge of designing for mediums within which very few standards exist. 
The class will seek to better understand these technologies, examining the features that differentiate these platforms as well as their capabilities and limitations, and exploring the methods and techniques that trick our brains into believing these environments to be "real". Students will play games and explore apps released for these platforms, dissecting them to discover best practices for designing content for users. 
Students will apply these learnings by creating brand new XR content. Course work will be performed in collaborative, cross-disciplinary teams as students form their own game studios to tackle design challenges and create games of their very own. These teams will engage in hands-on development, and will have roles for artists, programmers, designers, producers and more. Students from all disciplines are encouraged to join. 
[Graduate students should sign up for 53-751 / Undergraduate students should sign up for 53-451] NOTE: Access to some types of equipment may be limited due to health and safety protocols.

###  53353 - Understanding Game Engines
This course is designed for non-programmers who want to learn how to create content with game engines such as Unity, which will be the primary tool used for this course. The course will explore the fundamental components and features of game engines - such as objects, inputs, movement, interactions, physics, UI, 2D and 3D art, animation, and sound - and the terminology and theory behind them.
Students will learn the principles of these concepts during in-class lectures, gain practical experience building game projects through guided coding exercises, and then apply what they have learned to the assignment work to complete their projects. This course does not have prerequisites, but a basic understanding of common code concepts (variables, loops, conditional statements) is recommended.
