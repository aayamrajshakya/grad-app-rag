## Technology Fee
The technology fee is paid only for the first five years in the program for students in good standing. The Tepper School also provides a laptop computer to Ph.D. students in their first year of study.
## Health Insurance
If you elect to enroll in CMU's [Student Health Insurance Plan (SHIP)](https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/), the university will cover 100 percent of the premium cost for your individual coverage. While you have the opportunity to purchase partner, spouse, or dependent coverage under the SHIP plan, the university's support will be limited to the individual coverage amount. Please note that if you wish to elect the required health insurance coverage under an alternative plan, you will not be eligible for the university support referenced here. In order to be eligible for the financial support, you must enroll in the SHIP program.
