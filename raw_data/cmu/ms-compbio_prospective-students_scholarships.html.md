Although our program does not offer any internal scholarships, the [CMU Fellowships and Scholarships Office (FSO)](https://www.cmu.edu/fso/prestigious-%20scholarships/national-and-international-awards/graduate-school.html) has a number of resources to assist in conducting a search for external scholarship options. There are also specific resources for [domestic students](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/) and others for [international students](https://www.cmu.edu/fso/intl-students/index.html). We have listed below a few specific opportunities to consider:

  * [American Indian Graduate Center](https://www.aigcs.org/scholarships-fellowships/graduate-students/)– provides a variety of funding opportunities for tribal students to assist with graduate studies in STEM fields.
  * [Great Minds in STEM](https://www.greatmindsinstem.org/scholarships/scholarshipguidelines) – provides fellowship opportunities for graduate students of Hispanic heritage or individuals who have demonstrated a significant service within the underserved community.
  * [Hispanic Scholarship Fund](https://www.hsf.net/scholarship)– designed to assist students of Hispanic heritage to obtain a university degree including graduate students with a primary focus on STEM fields of study.
  * [International Peace Scholarship](https://www.peointernational.org/about-peo-international-peace-scholarship-ips) – scholarship for international female students to pursue graduate study in the United States.
  * [National GEM Consortium](https://www.gemfellowship.org/) – (US Citizens only) opportunities for fellowships for individuals from underrepresented communities to pursue graduate education in applied science and engineering
  * [Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans](https://www.pdsoros.org/)– graduate school fellowships for immigrants and children of immigrants.
  * [CMU Rales Fellowship Program](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/grad/index.html) - developing a diverse community of exceptionally talented national STEM leaders from under-resourced backgrounds.

The above list is incomplete, [more are visible here](https://www.cmu.edu/fso/prestigious-%20scholarships/national-and-international-awards/graduate-school.html). However, no list is 100% complete and many students find other opportunities. We update our databases as often as we become aware of new opportunities.
Students are encouraged to look for scholarships from their home countries and international organizations.
