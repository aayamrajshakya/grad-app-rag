Join a proud and growing tradition. This program goes beyond academics—it’s a comprehensive, hands-on experience designed to equip you with the skills, knowledge, and connections to thrive in product management.
### Your Product Management Evolution
Your experience in our program starts long before your first class, and the support of the Tepper School stays with you long after your final exam. Read below to learn about how our student experience prepares you for both academic success, and for your future career. 
## Be Part of the Legacy
The MS in Product Management is a unique, modern program launched in 2018. This gives our students the opportunity to be actively involved in creating class traditions and program features.
In 2024, our students invented a competition called Product Wars, inviting 20 industry professionals and executives to work on a half-day challenge with aspiring product managers. Our students have also taken a leadership role in a new club called [Product@CMU](https://substack.com/@productcmu) which provides networking activities, content creation and invites prominent guest speakers.
### An Inclusive Community; A Welcoming Environment
Our program brings together students from a wide range of backgrounds, each contributing their unique skills and perspectives. United by a commitment to excellence and innovation, they are driven to make an impact across industries and disciplines.

### Do I Need a Computer Science Background?
Contrary to traditional belief, a computer science background is not inherently required to build great products.
Our students come from a variety of backgrounds, but share a technical aptitude and strong desire to learn. While expertise in computer science may be common in this industry, it is by no means the only path.
Meet Jeff, a senior product manager at Time Warner and MAX. While Jeff comes from a nontechnical background, he showed the drive to learn.
