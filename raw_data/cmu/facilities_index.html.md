## Safety is a priority in all of our facilities
World-class experimental and advanced computational facilities are available at Carnegie Mellon for materials research. Whether for structural characterization, materials processing, or property/performance determination, materials research is an equipment-intensive enterprise. The MSE department maintains a range of central facilities available to all, especially focused on structural characterization and computations, and individual faculty maintain a broader range of equipment focused on materials processing and property/performance determination.
