# Soft materials and complex fluids
At the intersection of chemical engineering, physics, and physical chemistry, we use micromechanical, rheological, optical, and spectroscopic experimental tools to discover how intermolecular and surface forces control the dynamics of micro- and nano-scale structures in soft matter. Areas of focus include:
  * colloidal suspensions, gels, emulsions, foams, and self-assembling solutions
  * coupling physical experiments with advanced data analytics in multicomponent systems to develop sustainable products


Our research generates novel separation and microreactor technologies, and it facilitates the design of formulated products for:
  * pharmaceuticals and drug delivery systems
  * agrochemicals
  * coatings
  * detergents


## Sample research projects
* ### Richard Cobos
I study electrokinetic phenomena through theory and computations. I specifically focus on nonlinear effects in electrophoresis and electrolyte transport in electrochemical cells. In electrophoresis, the main goal is to predict the effect of inherent non-linearities in the phenomenon, obviated in the classical theory, in colloid motion as the electric field gets stronger.

* ### Emerson Uhlig
I use applied mathematical techniques to study transport phenomena at fluid-fluid interfaces. This includes mass transfer and adsorption of an ionic surfactant to a fluid-fluid interface with specific application to the phenomenon of spontaneous emulsification (also called the "ouzo effect"). This is where an emulsion (oil droplets dispersed in water, e.g. a salad dressing) forms upon combining two immiscible liquids without the need to significantly agitate the mixture, which has numerous applications ranging from pharmaceuticals to food science.

* ### Huda Usman
My research focuses on developing "microbial nanocultures"—engineered microsystems that enable the growth and study of environmental microbes under controlled, native-like conditions. By combining polymer design, microfluidics, and advanced imaging techniques, I can observe how microbes grow, interact, and respond to their surroundings in real time. This work supports the discovery of new antibiotics and helps us better understand microbial behavior and evolution.

* ### Maryam Ali
My research involves the development of high-throughput experiments to measure properties of multi-component fluid formulations. My goal is to develop empirical models relating bulk properties to the underlying molecular mechanisms in order to systematically develop innovative and sustainable formulations. Currently, I am validating a high-throughput spectroscopic method to measure micellar enhanced solubility of water-insoluble molecules.

* ### Nicholas Hattrup
Computational simulations, like molecular dynamics, help us understand and discover new materials and molecules. My research focuses on improving these simulation methods so we can estimate material properties more efficiently and with fewer resources. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that can be routinely used in large-scale material screening efforts, which are becoming more and more common.
