## Bio
Tony Sun graduated magna cum laude from UCLA in 2025 with a double major in Statistics & Data Science and Mathematics/Economics. Prior to joining the MSCF program, he developed strong programming and problem-solving skills through academic research and discovered a deep interest in quantitative finance during his internships.  
  
At Equitable, he built a dynamic dashboard for a $6B asset-backed securities portfolio, automating data updates and helping portfolio managers more effectively monitor trends and risks. As an undergraduate researcher, he customized a U-Net deep learning model to track bacterial movement in lab imaging data. More recently, he has been working under the guidance of a quant researcher to develop sentiment-based stock return prediction models, focusing on signal engineering.  
  
Outside the classroom, Tony actively trades stocks and simple option strategies, which has deepened his understanding of discipline and market behavior. He joined the MSCF program to strengthen his technical foundation and gain exposure to a wide range of asset classes. Tony is excited to explore opportunities in quantitative research, trading, and beyond.
