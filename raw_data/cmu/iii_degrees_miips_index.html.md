## IPD 
## The Integrated Product Development Capstone: Designing the Future
Join a select, powerful network of innovators who have taken our pioneering capstone course: Integrated Product Development. Founded in 1986, the course originated from the writings of Nobel Laureate and Carnegie Mellon University professor Herb Simon and became the cornerstone of the MIIPS program in 2003. The course and MIIPS degree program have become a model for other universities. You'll work with industry sponsors on real-world problems, designing product and service solutions that impact real people.
## Hear from MIIPS graduates and capstone sponsors on the capstone experience:
Virgil Looney (MIIPS '22) shares why the capstone course was crucial to his decision to enroll in the MIIPS program.
