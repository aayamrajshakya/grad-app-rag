### Time Limitation of Direct Subsidized Loan Eligibility
#### For First-Time Borrowers
There is a limit on the maximum period of time (measured in academic years) that a student can receive Direct Subsidized Loans. In general, students may not receive Direct Subsidized Loans for more than 150% of the published length of their program. [View details](https://studentaid.gov/app/directSubsidizedLoanTimeLimitation.action).
## Federal Direct Unsubsidized & Parent PLUS Loan Information
There are situations when students or parents would like access to the Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan and/or Parent PLUS Loan resources. Instructions are outlined below. Please note for all options the student must submit the [FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/). 
  * Parents of dependent students who would like to borrow the Parent PLUS Loan must submit the PLUS Loan application. [Click here](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/plus/index.html) for details.* 
  * Dependent students who would like to add a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan to their aid offer should reach out to their [HUB Liaison](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/contact/liaisons.html) directly. 
  * Dependent students whose parents refuse to support them may be able to receive a dependent level Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan only. For a student to be eligible for this loan, they will answer ‘Yes’ to the ‘Direct Unsubsidized Loan Only’ question on their FAFSA. In addition, a statement from the parent(s) (signed & dated) must be submitted that shows the parent(s) either refuse to complete the FAFSA or the parent(s) do not and will not provide any financial support to the student (including the date support ended).


*Students with parents, who have applied for and are unable to obtain the Parent PLUS loan, can request to borrow additional Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan with assistance from their HUB Liaison.
