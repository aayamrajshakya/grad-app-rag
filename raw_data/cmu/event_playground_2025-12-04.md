## ABOUT PLAYGROUND
PLAYGROUND began as an annual event in the Fall 2003 as a means to create a concentrated opportunity for students to engage in creative exploration outside of their regular curriculum or beyond their current areas of study. During a single week, classes within the School of Drama are set aside, and students are allowed the time, space, and resources to create their own works. Participation is completely voluntary, and grades are not given. 
### HOW PLAYGROUND WORKS
Students submit proposals to a committee comprised of students and faculty. Proposals range from live performances, short films, light shows, art installations, murals, and more. Students often collaborate with other CMU departments such as the School of Music, the Entertainment and Technology Center (ETC), and even students from other universities. Selected pieces rehearse and prepare over a period of four days, followed by the festival of showings that runs from Thursday through Saturday in and around the Purnell Center for the Arts. 
### PLAYGROUND’S CREATIVE BENEFITS
Students who participate in PLAYGROUND reap a number of rewards. It supports risk-taking, community engagement and belonging, and empowerment. The School of Drama supports and encourages the students’ diverse artistic interests and creative expansion. Student participation in PLAYGROUND continues to grow with between 65-80 proposals submitted each year. Countless students over the past 20 years have used their experiences in PLAYGROUND as seeds for future professional artistic endeavors.

### PigPen’s Playground
[PigPen Theatre Co.](https://www.pigpentheatre.com/) – the seven-member band of storytellers who met and formed at CMU School of Drama – remembers the “frienzied highs and lows of Playground week.”
“Working on our sophomore show as a company was an amazing experience that cemented our commitment to each other,” said bandmate Dan Weschler. “I’ll never forget hanging up a huge strip of canvas across one of our living rooms for a shadow screen, bathing the room in amber light and making shadow landscapes.”
