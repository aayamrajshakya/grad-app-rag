## Bio
Ziyue (Skyler) Wang graduated from New York University in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and a double major in Data Science. At the intersection of mathematics and coding, Skyler discovered her true passion for quantitative finance. During her undergraduate studies, she worked as a research assistant at the NYU Volatility Institute, where she rigorously explored the role of option skewness in predicting returns. Skyler gained practical experience through internships as a quantitative researcher. At Xiangcai Securities, she delved into option pricing and backtesting, while her internship at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities allowed her to design and implement a framework for factor testing and a system for writing and reading factor libraries. Skyler joined the MSCF program to further develop her skills in quantitative-problem solving and finance market. Upon graduation, she plans to pursue a career in quantitative research and quantitative modeling.
