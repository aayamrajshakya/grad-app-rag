# Artificial Intelligence at the Tepper School
## The Birthplace of AI
In 1955, [Herbert A. Simon](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/about/nobel-laureates) and [Alan Newell](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/anniversary/profiles/1950/allen-newell.html) wanted to see if a computer could play chess. Instead, they invented artificial intelligence (AI).
Simon saw the value in the mathematical power of computers, but he also wondered — could computers solve business problems? Could a computer learn to weigh options, consider risks, and make conclusions with incomplete information? How could it simulate human problem-solving?
The result was The Logic Theorist, a “thinking machine” recognized as the first artificial intelligence program. It couldn’t solve business problems, but it was a big first step.
It took almost 70 years, but we are making it happen.   

## Research
The Tepper School of Business faculty members and researchers have a tradition of over seven decades of AI research and its uses in the business world. By incorporating business disciplines, computer science, and the humanities, our researchers look at every aspect of AI and how it can be adopted to improve productivity and efficiency, optimize processes, and boost overall performance in any business setting.
Our faculty has a growing body of research regarding the application and innovation of artificial intelligence in business.

## Signature Initiative: Collaborative AI
Thinking of AI as a collaborator or a partner allows us to think about business practices such as problem solving, operations, management, and in completely different ways. In the classroom, Collaborative AI is a way to open new possibilities in teaching and learning, and enhance every student’s business education.
