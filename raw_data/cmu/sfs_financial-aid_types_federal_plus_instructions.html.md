# Federal PLUS Loan Instructions
All Federal Parent and Graduate PLUS Loan borrowers will need to complete a Federal Direct PLUS Loan request/application AND a new Master Promissory Note (MPN). In addition, all Graduate PLUS Loan borrowers will need to complete Entrance Counseling.
### First-Time Borrowers
Those (parent or graduate student) planning on borrowing a Federal PLUS Loan for the first time should wait to complete the application process (displayed below) until receiving a financial aid award letter. The award letter will be necessary in helping to determine the amount of the request. Families should not apply for a PLUS Loan earlier than June 1 since the PLUS Loan requires a credit approval that is only valid for 180 days.
