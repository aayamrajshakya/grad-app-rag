##  CMIST is proud to announce the launch of our new graduate program beginning fall 2025.
The Master of Science in Security, Technology, and International Relations is a master’s degree that prepares tomorrow’s professionals for strategic leadership in analyzing, managing, predicting, and adapting to new technologies’ impact on the United States and the rest of the world. The program offers outstanding training in the analytical tools of political science and international relations, alongside an exceptional foundation in Carnegie Mellon University’s cutting-edge technological advances, to give our graduates the essential skills to shape a better, safer future.
MS STAIR students will spend their fall and spring semesters in Pittsburgh, taking courses at Carnegie Mellon’s main campus and applying for summer internships with the support of CMIST advisory staff and faculty. Students will relocate to Washington, DC, for a summer semester to complete an internship and curricular elective requirement before graduation. With a well-located facility in the heart of Capitol Hill—across from the US Capitol building and adjacent to the US Supreme Court—CMIST provides students with privileged access to current and former policymakers, excellent teaching by experienced professionals, and networking opportunities through career-enhancing internships. CMIST also provides optional rental housing in Washington, for graduates during their summer internship to facilitate an easy relocation transition.   
  
The 12-month program is well-suited for individuals who want to quickly advance their professional career as it encompasses advanced curricula in international security and international relations topics that intersect with emerging and developing technologies. Courses in qualitative and quantitative social science methods for program evaluation and policy writing enhance our students’ expertise in informing and persuading diverse audiences across various industries. Culminating in a summer semester interning in Washington, students synthesize classroom learning objectives with practical and hands-on experiential learning opportunities. 
There is no better place to study security, technology, and international relations than Carnegie Mellon University, a thought leader in global and national security issues, policies, and strategies related to digital technologies. CMIST graduate students will be uniquely poised to influence the future, with innovative research happening across the Pittsburgh campus in all the relevant technological areas—

# Internships
## Brief Overview of Expectations
The final semester of the MS STAIR program takes place in Washington, DC. Students will intern full-time, working 25 to 40 hours per week, while also taking one evening class to fulfill curricular requirements.
CMIST faculty and staff assist students in applying and securing an approved summer internship during their fall and spring semesters in the program. Internships generally need to be related to emerging technologies, national/international security, international relations, and/or political science. 
The internship allows students to synthesize learning objectives of the program with practical and hands-on experiential learning opportunities. Mid-semester reports and a formal presentation at the end of their internship experience are required of each student. The reports and presentation will include detailed reflections on their professional experience during the internship and make distinct connections between their completed coursework, research, and culminating internship experience.
If a student is coming to the MS STAIR with a DC-based job that is relevant to their program of study, they would be eligible to return to their previously-held position and have that count toward the internship requirement. Students are encouraged to mention this in their application materials or early in their studies to the graduate program manager to begin the waiver approval process. 
## Logistics of Relocation to DC
Students can choose to live in CMU-sponsored housing in the heart of Washington for a competitive monthly rental price for the duration of their summer semester. The residences are fully furnished and equipped with standard kitchen appliances, cookware, and dinnerware, as well as an in-unit washer and dryer, cable, and high-speed internet. Amenities include access to a gym and cycling studio, business center with free coffee, and a rooftop lounge with skyline views of DC. 
Housing is minutes away from grocery stores and Metro stations, providing easy access to the CMIST DC classroom, internship sites, and the city beyond.

## CMIST Emerging Leaders Scholarship
Every applicant to the MS STAIR program is automatically considered for the Emerging Leaders Scholarship, which is a financial award applied to a student’s tuition cost–typically divided equally between the first two enrolled semesters. These awards are determined based on an applicant’s past academic performance, the quality of their application materials, and demonstrated financial need. 
There is a limited amount of funds that CMIST is able to distribute. The MS STAIR admissions committee will consider all included application materials when determining recipients. Scholarship recipients will be notified of this award, its amount, and the specific terms for distribution in their admissions decision letter. There is no separate application needed to be considered for this financial award. 
## Funding for US Military and Veterans:
CMIST welcomes applications from veterans and those currently serving in the US Military. The institute offers a limited number of scholarships every year for graduates from select US military academies. In addition, the University’s Registrar’s Office provides services to veterans and their dependents who are eligible for Veterans Education Benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill, Post-9/11 GI Bill. 
# FAQs
## What career fields or job opportunities is MS STAIR preparing students for? 
Graduates from the MS STAIR program will have a diverse skill set that prepares them to be successful in governmental or non-governmental positions. It will also give graduates a strategic advantage toward leadership positions focused on intersections between emerging technologies, international security, and policymaking. 
Some specific career trajectories could include: Policy Analysis and Writing; NGO & Governmental Program Management; Public Service Official; Research Associates; Regional Affairs Specialist; Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Associates; Public Relations; Government Affairs and Relations, Global Operations, Advocacy Associate, Social Impact Analysis, Campaign Manager; International Education Advisor; Strategic Director; etc. 
## What professional development resources are available to MS STAIR students?
The [Career and Professional Development Center](https://www.cmu.edu/career/) is a resource available to all CMU students. They offer one-on-one advising with career consultants and peer mentors on a regular basis, in addition to giving students access to the Handshake professional social networking platform. They also provide ample resources for career exploration, resume/cover letter writing, alumni mentorship, and scheduled career fair events and preparation.
In addition, students will meet regularly with the CMIST graduate program manager to strategize internship and post-graduation placements, finalize application documents, and practice interview skills. 
Finally, every fall semester, CMIST holds an Internship Application Workshop to create a deliberate time and space for students to focus their attention on internship applications and eventual post-graduation plans within the MS STAIR career fields.
## Can I do a summer internship that is remote or outside of the DC region? 
Generally, all internships must be located in the DC metro area and must include a minimum of two days a week spent in the office for the duration of the internship. Proposed internships that do not meet either of these requirements will need to be approved by the graduate program manager.
## Can I be fully or partially remote for the curricular semesters of the program? 
Most of the MS STAIR classes are only offered in-person and CMIST’s policy is that current students can enroll in only one fully online course a semester. For these reasons, a student would not be able to enroll as fully or partially remote for the MS STAIR program. 
## Are there part-time enrollment options for the MS STAIR? 
The department’s preference would be that all students remain full time for the duration of the program. Any part-time enrollment options will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Any interest in part-time enrollment options should be communicated to the graduate program manager early in the application process. 
## Can I begin the MS STAIR in the spring or summer semester instead of fall? 
The MS STAIR only admits students in the fall semester.
## Are current CMU employees/staff eligible to apply for the MS STAIR program? 
Yes, we welcome all CMU employees and staff members to apply. If a person is interested in part-time enrollment in the MS STAIR, they would need to contact the graduate program manager to discuss options. There is potential for current employees to have the internship requirement tied to their current position at the university, so relocation to the DC area may not be necessary for these individuals. 
## Can international students apply to the MS STAIR?
Of course! We will work with all international students on internship placement because some DC-based internships require US citizenship. Students are eligible to use Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to facilitate their summer internship only after completing two full-time consecutive semesters in the program. The [Office of International Education](https://www.cmu.edu/oie/) is an important resource for all prospective and current international students at CMU.
