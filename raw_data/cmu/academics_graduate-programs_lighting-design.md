# Lighting Design
## Illuminating Possibilities
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama’s MFA Lighting Design program offers a holistic view of lighting as an art and craft, requiring both aesthetic and technical training and skill. Students receive theoretical training in the classroom and practical training in production. With access to top-flight facilities and equipment, students are prepared to design across a wide array of venues and genres. Our faculty and alumni work extensively throughout the industry, and are instrumental in helping new graduates launch their professional careers.
### Lighting Design Curriculum
Lighting students learn processes that explore all aspects of light as a visual design element. Students gain knowledge and expertise in the latest technology including automated lighting fixtures, LED fixtures, computer consoles, visualization software programs and media design software. Lighting students become efficient in focus and cueing, Vectorworks and Autocad drafting, designer and technical management paperwork, and lighting design for a range of genres, venues, and production scale.
