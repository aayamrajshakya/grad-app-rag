"The online and hybrid nature of the program drew me in, because it offered access to a great institution with the flexibility to maintain a full-time job in Atlanta. I have found the program to be very manageable with my full-time work in addition to flexible time for family, friends, and other personal projects. Balancing my 9-5 job with the course allowed me to apply what I learned directly to my work.   
  
The program's focus on product development, research, and collaboration has positively impacted my daily role, helping me generate new ideas and align them with business goals. The connections I've made with professors and students have been invaluable for expanding my perspectives, gaining market exposure, and building lasting friendships."
