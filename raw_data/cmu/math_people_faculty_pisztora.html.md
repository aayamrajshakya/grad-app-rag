#  Research 
My research interest is concerned with probabilistic analysis of random fields, certain disordered systems and of phase transitions. The basic goal is to explain phenomena observed at a macroscopic level by a probabilistic analysis based entirely on microscopic hypotheses on the underlying system. Random systems often behave deterministically on the macroscopic level due to some kind of self-averaging behavior. In other cases randomness might be retained (or even created) on the macroscopic level as well (for instance turbulence or critical systems in statistical physics). To understand the mechanism responsible for either type of behavior poses challenging research problems.
