## Bio
Frank graduated Summa Cum Laude from New York University in 2024, majoring in Economics and Mathematics with two minors in Computer Science and Business Studies. His passion for quantitative finance is rooted in mathematical finance research at NYU Paris, where he acquainted himself with the essential mathematics and programming skills to implement Binomial Model Pricing and the Black-Scholes model. This instance paved the way for him to engage in advanced studies at CMU, where he is now honing his expertise in stochastic calculus, machine learning, and computational methods in finance. Beyond academics, Frank is a civil aviation enthusiast passionate about aircraft types, cabins, airlines, and cost-effective air tickets. In an undergraduate data science project, he utilized the Jupyter Notebook and pandas to analyze the air traffic trends in the Great New York Area and discovered dynamic changes taking place in three major airports. Upon graduation, he will pursue a career in quantitative trading and research.
