## Bio
Graduated from a military high school, I deeply value working and conquering as a team. I aspire to become a Quant Trader or Researcher within a team that works closely together and solves problems. My past working experiences span from data science to quantitative research and trading. Learning and growing among brilliant minds and people with different talents excites me. I believe my wide experiences and fast learning ability can bring me an edge. I will be available on Zoom or coffee chats in NYC, and I really look forward to discussing with you about how to contribute to your team and firm.
