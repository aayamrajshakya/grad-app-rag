Carnegie Mellon University has a number of research centers focused on advancing research in fields related to security and/or privacy. Some research centers are run directly out of CyLab while others partner with CyLab on research but are run independently of CyLab. The list below is not exhaustive but highlights some of the major centers at the University focusing on topics important to CyLab.
## [Center for Informed Democracy & Social-cybersecurity (IDeaS)](https://www.cmu.edu/ideas-social-cybersecurity/)
The goal of the Center for IDeaS at Carnegie Mellon University is to enhance social-cybersecurity to preserve and support an informed democratic society. IDeaS will provide people with the knowledge and tools to overcome these challenges–preserving and supporting the citizenry–through research, education and community-building within social cybersystems. We must remain informed, thoughtful members of our communities and countries, despite online and informational challenges. The Center for IDeaS is co-directed by CyLab's Kathleen Carley and Mark Kamlet.
## [Collaboratory Against Hate](https://www.collabagainsthate.org/)
The Collaboratory Against Hate aspires to develop and support innovative multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and cross-university research aimed at understanding how extremist hate is generated, how it circulates in online and real-life spaces, and how it polarizes society and provokes harmful and illegal acts, especially toward communities of color and other minoritized groups. The Collaboratory, which is co-directed by CyLab's Lorrie Cranor, seeks to develop effective interventions to inhibit every stage in the creation and growth of extremist hate groups and to minimize their destructive consequences.
## CyLab Biometrics Center
Authentication by biometric verification is becoming increasingly common in corporate and public security systems, consumer electronics and point of sale (POS) applications. At the [CyLab Biometrics Center](http://www.cmu-biometrics.org/), the primary research thrusts that will be developed and will use leveraged resources: 3D face reconstruction, 2D pose correction, and 2D facial landmark detection. 
## CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory
The [CyLab Usable Privacy and Security Laboratory](http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/) (CUPS) brings together researchers working on a diverse set of projects related to understanding and improving the usability of privacy and security software and systems. The privacy and security research community has become increasingly aware that usability problems severely impact the effectiveness of mechanisms designed to provide security and privacy in software systems. 
## [Secure and Private IoT Initiative (IoT@CyLab)](https://cylab.cmu.edu/research/iot/index.html)
CyLab's Secure and Private IoT Initiative (IoT@CyLab) is a one-of-a-kind industry/academic collaboration with the mission of creating secure and privacy-preserving foundations for emerging Internet of Things (IoT) systems. CyLab's Vyas Sekar and Anthony Rowe serve as IoT@CyLab's co-directors.
