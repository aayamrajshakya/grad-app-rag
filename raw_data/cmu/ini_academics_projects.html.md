# At the INI, projects come in many forms.
For those with a strong interest in research and development, you can complete an independent study, thesis or research-based project at one of several research centers, including [Carnegie Mellon Cylab.](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/projects.html#cylab)
However, research at the INI is not confined to the university setting. Students may also solve real-world problems for companies through [internships](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/notpublished/internship.html) or [practicum projects](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/practicum.html).

# Practicum Project
Bicoastal information security and mobility students work alongside industry, research and government sponsors on a semester-long capstone project at CMU Silicon Valley. Projects span a variety of topics in computing, mobile systems and security, and range from fundamental research to software development.

# Internship
From Pittsburgh to Palo Alto and Fort Meade to Seattle, INI students innovate at summer internships with top tech companies, research centers and government agencies. As a software engineering intern at Pinterest, Caleb de la Cruz endeavored to make the virtual pinboard faster. “I love this job because you get to work on challenging problems alongside coworkers who are extremely talented,” he said.

# Research Assistantship (RA)
INI students have the opportunity to work on research projects through affiliated research centers. Manideep Konakandla (MSIS, 2017) served as an RA for Professor Limin Jia. “Manideep’s contributions towards finding vulnerabilities in container technologies and suggesting patches have helped millions of users who are early adaptors of the technology but are skeptical about its security,” she said.
# Research-Based Project
The research-based project is a curriculum option for MSIN and MSIS students. Alex Qin and Cheng Ye Zhang (MSIT-IS, 2011) analyzed the security of Android under the supervision of Professor Nicolas Christin. Using their collective knowledge of Linux and access control systems to break the Android infrastructure, the team identified potential security breaches that Google could correct.
