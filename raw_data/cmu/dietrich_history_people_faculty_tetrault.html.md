## Bio
Professor Tetrault specializes in the history of gender, race, and American democracy, with a focus on social movements and memory.
Her first book, _[The Myth of Seneca Falls: Memory and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1848-1898](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Seneca-Falls-Suffrage-1848-1898/dp/1469614278/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1443041908&sr=1-1&keywords=myth+of+seneca+falls)_ (University of North Carolina Press, 2014) won the Organization of American Historians' inaugural Mary Jurich Nickliss women's history book prize. The Myth uncovers the politics behind the manufacture of an origins myth for feminism. Typically, the beginning of a women’s rights movement in the United States is dated to 1848, to the first women’s rights meeting in Seneca Falls, NY. This origins story, however, did not become commonplace until much late, born of the politics of Reconstruction. A handful of women created this story in response to Reconstruction-era politics, some forty to fifty years after the actual meeting, with broad-reaching implications for the content and direction of the movement.
Tetrault is currently at work on two book-length projects. The first, A Celebrated But Misunderstood Amendment
The second, Enter Woman Suffrage: A New History of Reconstruction, 1865-1878
Tetrault also lectures on the U.S. suffrage movement, broadly construed, and is active as a public historian. In 2019, she delivered the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery’s Votes for Women Exhibit keynote address. She currently serves as an historical consultant for the National Constitution Center’s Nineteenth Amendment Exhibit, the Woodrow Wilson House’s Women’s Suffrage Initiative, the documentary “The Vote” (upcoming on PBS’s the American Experience), and Ancestry dot com’s new Women’s Suffrage Project.
Tetrault’s work has been supported by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Massachusetts Historical Society, the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University, the Newberry Library, and the Smithsonian Institution. The American Historical Association and the Library of Congress awarded her the 2007 J. Franklin Jameson Fellowship, then given for the most promising book by a young historian. She has also received funding from the Huntington Library, the Schlesinger Library, the Sophia Smith Collection, and many others.
In 2018, Tetrault was awarded the college's [Elliot Dunlap Smith Teaching Award](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/news/2018/elliot-dunlap-smith.html).
