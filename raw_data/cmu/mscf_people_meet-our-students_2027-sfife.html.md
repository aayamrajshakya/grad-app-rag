## Bio
Analyze. Plan. Execute.  
  
I'm a dedicated worker and a lifelong learner. My curiosity drives me to dig deeper, ask questions, and constantly expand what I know. My passion for mathematics has shaped every step of my academic and career journey.  
  
I'm drawn to quantitative finance because it blends mathematical thinking, complex systems, and constant growth. I thrive on structure and precision and embrace the challenge of building solutions for dynamic, real-world problems. Whether I'm writing code, communicating a concept, or studying markets, I bring focus and clarity to everything I do.  
  
I graduated from Purdue University with Highest Distinction, earning a 3.99 GPA with a double major in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I have worked in a quantitative role at Bank of America, served as a teaching assistant for Ordinary Differential Equations and C Programming, contributed as a software engineering intern on a full-stack development team, and held leadership positions on community-centered engineering teams focused on real-world technical solutions.  
  
I'm excited to bring my strengths in mathematics, programming, and problem-solving to a quantitative strategy team, where I can help build models and tools that support trading decisions, optimize performance, and drive insight. I'd welcome the chance to connect and discuss how I can contribute.
