# Risk analysis
Combining expertise in science, engineering, economics, decision analysis, psychology, and behavioral decision theory, EPP is home to one of the world’s leading research programs in risk analysis and risk communication. Our work ranges from the analysis of new and underappreciated risks to ways of improving risk management and regulation. We study public perception and how we can increase common understanding of risks and encourage active public participation in risk-related decisions.

### [The risks of communicating extreme climate forecasts  For decades, climate change researchers and activists have used dramatic forecasts to attempt to influence public perception of the problem and as a call to action on climate change. These forecasts have frequently been for events that might be called “apocalyptic,” because they predict cataclysmic events resulting from climate change. In a new paper published in the International Journal of Global Warming, Carnegie Mellon University’s David Rode and Paul Fischbeck argue that making such forecasts can be counterproductive.  ](https://epp.engineering.cmu.edu/news/2021/02/18-risks-extreme-climate-factors.html)
