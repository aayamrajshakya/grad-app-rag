# Case Studies
## Behind the Scenes of Bold Ideas
Get an inside look at how ETC students collaborate with partners to design the future of entertainment technology.
Each semester at the ETC, students work in interdisciplinary teams to design and prototype innovative experiences—from games and tools to installations and immersive worlds. These case studies offer a closer look at standout projects from recent years: how they came together, who they were built for, and what our students learned along the way.
Created in collaboration with real-world partners and guided by faculty mentorship, these projects reflect the ETC’s core values—creativity, experimentation, teamwork, and a drive to shape what’s next in entertainment technology.
## Flow
Flow follows a deer and a dancer, who meet and become friends in an intricately rendered world inspired by classical Chinese art. Players help them overcome obstacles by mirroring dance-like gestures tracked via motion sensors — a duet between the user and the technology, rather than a solo performance.
