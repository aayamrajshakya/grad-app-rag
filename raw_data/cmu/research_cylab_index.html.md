The CyLab-Africa initiative, a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University’s CyLab Security and Privacy Institute and CMU-Africa, aims to improve the cybersecurity of digital systems in Africa and other emerging economies. CyLab researchers from CMU-Africa and CMU-Pittsburgh are studying the security, privacy, and equity of digital tools and services in Africa through a combination of research, education, and public outreach.
There is a huge amount of projected growth in the African economy over the next five years. In order to drive digital inclusion alongside that growth, experts say big improvements need to be made to the security and resilience of the continent’s financial technologies and infrastructure.
