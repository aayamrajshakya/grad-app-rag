# Energy and environment
We are developing new materials and processes for efficient energy conversion and storage devices, exploring ways to minimize global climate change, and more.
## Energy and environment
* ### Advanced vehicle systems and technologies
Researchers investigate the economic, environment, and social implications of current and future vehicle technologies. How can we build better technologies—ones that are cleaner, more efficient, affordable, and sustainable?
Fuel cell, advanced lithium batteries, electric aviation, autonomous vehicles, and the policies surrounding these technologies, are some of the areas we are exploring.
