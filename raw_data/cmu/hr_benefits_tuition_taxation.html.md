  * Children Attending CMU
  * Children Attending Another Institution:


##  How Taxes Are Withheld
  * Applicable taxes will be withheld from your salary, not from the benefit.
  * Taxes must be withheld in the year in which the benefit was received (i.e., when the check is issued), regardless of when the courses are taken.
  * Taxes assessed on your tuition benefits will be withheld from your pay by CMU in three monthly installments (for those paid monthly) or in six biweekly installments (for those paid biweekly).
  * Taxation will begin with the next pay following your application approval, and will be withheld across three months, or the number of months remaining in the calendar year, whichever is less.
  * Changes to your benefit level in the middle of a semester (for example, adding or dropping a class) will be reflected in the taxes withheld in the remaining months.


### Example
The following example of federal taxation uses an approximate federal withholding rate of 30% and examples of approved tuition benefit amounts. It is meant to illustrate scenarios to help you estimate taxation for financial planning purposes, not provide an exact amount.
If your tuition benefits total $6,320 for the fall 2024 term (and it is your first term for calendar year 2024), your taxable tuition benefit over the course of three months is $1,070 ($6,320 tuition total − $5,250 federal exemption). The additional tax withheld from your paycheck over three months is $107 per month ($1,070 taxable tuition benefits × 30% withholding rate = $321/3 months = $107).
If your tuition benefits total $6,320 for the spring 2025 term, your taxable tuition benefit over the course of three months would be the same as the fall 2024 term ($6,320 tuition total − $5,250 federal exemption = $1,070). The additional tax withholding would also be approximately $107 per month for three consecutive months.
If your tuition benefits total $6,320 for the fall 2025 term, your taxable tuition benefit over the course of the three months would be $2,106.67 per month ($6,320/3) and the additional tax withholding would be approximately $632 per month ($2,106.67 × 30%).
