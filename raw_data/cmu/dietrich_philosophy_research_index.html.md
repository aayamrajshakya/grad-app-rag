# Research
## The areas of research in the department appear non-traditional, but, on closer inspection, are simply modern approaches to answering old questions.
In developing these approaches, we aim to bridge the gap between the humanities and the sciences. Consequently, our work is interdisciplinary and highly focused. Philosophers have a reputation for creating problems. Our department stands in that tradition, but is dedicated to solving problems as well.
