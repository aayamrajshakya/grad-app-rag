Bio
Anika Walke joined the department in 2025 as the Inaugural Askwith Family Chair of Holocaust Studies. Prior to that, she served as Associate Professor of History and Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies at Washington University in St. Louis.
Walke’s research and teaching interests include the history and memory of war and genocide, flight and migration, nationality policies, and gender and sexuality in Eastern Europe. A graduate of the History of Consciousness Department at the University of California, Santa Cruz, Walke draws on an interdisciplinary framework to study processes of remembering and commemoration, survival and resistance, and the role of space and place for historical experience and sense-making.
Her book Pioneers and Partisans: An Oral History of Nazi Genocide in Belorussia (Oxford University Press, 2015) drew on oral history interviews, video testimony, archival documentation and various other sources to analyze how young Soviet Jews survived the Holocaust and made sense of it many decades later. Together with Jan Musekamp and Nicole Svobodny she edited Migration and Mobility in the Modern Age: Refugees, Travelers, and Traffickers in Europe and Eurasia (Indiana University Press, 2017). She regularly publishes peer reviewed articles and book chapters on the history and memory of the Holocaust, on the Soviet Jewish experience, and on various subjects related to the construction of memory. She is currently working on a new monograph on the long aftermath of the Holocaust and World War II in Belarus.
From 2014 to 2022, Walke served as Co-PI of “The Holocaust Ghettos Project: Reintegrating Victims and Perpetrators through Places and Events,” an NEH-funded endeavor of the Holocaust Geographies Collaborative to develop a Historical GIS of Nazi-era ghettos in Eastern Europe. In addition, she has held a range of fellowships including most recently a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Senior Fellowship at the Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies at Freiburg University in Germany (Spring 2024).
