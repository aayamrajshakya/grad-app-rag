## Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) Education
A number of avenues exist at CMU for formal learning about ethical conduct of research and the standards within this research community. Education has long been required for individuals participating in Human Subject research and Animal research at CMU. Research ethics is addressed at Graduate Student orientation, some other orientation programs and in some classes. On-line education focused on Responsible Conduct of Research is available via [CITI](http://www.citiprogram.org/).   
  
Typically RCR education addresses the following topics:
  * Data Acquisition and Management - collection, accuracy, security, access
  * Authorship and Publication
  * Peer Review
  * Mentor / Trainee Responsibilities
  * Collaboration
  * Conflict of Interest
  * Research Misconduct
  * Human Subject Research
  * Use of Animals in Research


## CITI On-line RCR Education 
To complete the CITI on-line education 
Please refer to the [CITI login instructions](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/clinical-trials/forms/2017%20Dec%20CITI%20Instructions.pdf) [PDF] to access the CITI training site.
All CMU employees and students have a CMU issued Andrew ID and should use Single Sign-On (SSO) to ensure that the course record is linked to your CMU activity. If you've used CITI prior to CMU having SSO, please check your CITI account and confirm that your CMU email address (XXX@andrew.cmu.edu) and your first and last name (per your official CMU record) are part of your CITI profile. This allows your previous CITI records to be matched with your current CITI and CMU activity. 
If you have trouble logging into CITI contact the CITI helpdesk. 
Select Curriculum
Once your registration is complete, you will be directed to "select your curriculum". For purposes of meeting the NSF requirement click "I do not need to take human subject research courses at this time", "I do not need to take Animal Care and Use courses at this time", and "I do not need to take the Export Control course at this time". 
Choose the Responsible Conduct of Research module most appropriate to the type of research you conduct (undergraduate, biomedical, social and behavioral, physical science, humanities, administrators, or engineering).
Complete the course
The course may take a few hours to complete but can be done over a period of time. When you complete the course, CITI will e-mail your completion record to the CMU Office of Research Integrity and Compliance. You may want to print a copy of the Completion Certificate for your records
## In-Person RCR Sessions at CMU
The CMU Office of Research Integrity and Compliance office presents a series of interactive sessions each semester with subject-matter experts on the topics typically included in the RCR curriculum. The Fall 2025 sessions are scheduled for October 29 and November 12. Sessions will take place from approximately 9am - 1:30 pm each day.
