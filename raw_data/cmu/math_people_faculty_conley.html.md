#  Research 
I work in descriptive set theory, which is the study of how the ability to define a set (say of real numbers) confers useful information about its mathematical properties. Restricting your attention to definable sets rather than arbitrary sets can have counterintuitive consequences: sets can be partitioned into more pieces than there are elements in the original set, acyclic graphs can be hard to color, etc. 
My specific work focuses on equivalence relations arising from measurable group actions or measurable graphs. Ergodic-theoretic properties of the group actions and combinatorial properties of the graphs often translate into set-theoretic properties of the induced equivalence relation. Thus, the area sits at the intersection of set theory, dynamics, and combinatorics.
