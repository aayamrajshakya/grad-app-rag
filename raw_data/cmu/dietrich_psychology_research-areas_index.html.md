# Research Areas
We are a diverse department of scientists bound together by a common desire to push the boundaries of science to understand the psychological and neural basis of human behavior.
Although our department is comprised of four primary research areas, almost all of us bridge across these areas, as well as to disciplines outside of psychology. Faculty often hold joint appointments, participating in programs as diverse as Computer Science, Human Computer Interaction, Machine Learning, Mechanical Engineering, Mind-Body Interactions, Neuroscience, Philosophy, Robotics, and the Science of Learning, as well as medical programs at the University of Pittsburgh.
Our interdisciplinarity is enhanced by CMU’s uniquely fluid intellectual style in which scientists across domains come together to solve common problems using state-of-the-art research tools, computational methods and data collection technologies.
