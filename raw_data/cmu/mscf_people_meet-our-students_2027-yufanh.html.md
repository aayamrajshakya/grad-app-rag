## Bio
I graduated from Vanderbilt University in May 2025 with a double major in Mathematics and Economics and a minor in Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I grew a strong passion for math and excelled in many challenging courses. Besides, I built a solid foundation in computer science by taking multiple technical courses and serving as a teaching assistant for Discrete Structures for one year.  
As a Quant Research Intern at Inchance Fund, I developed machine learning models using Python and tested financial factors to evaluate their predictive power. My work included momentum strategy optimization, which delivered 16% annualized returns over five years through backtesting. This experience deepened my expertise in data-driven investing and algorithmic trading—fields I’m eager to pursue in my career. Outside of my professional pursuits, I am a tennis and badminton enthusiast and dedicated photographer. I enrolled in the MSCF Program to deepen my expertise in quantitative problem-solving and global financial markets. I am currently looking for a Quant Research Internship for Summer 2026.
