## Bio
My undergraduate degree is in Finance from Peking University, and I am about to enroll in CMU MSCF. My two quantitative research experiences at hedge funds have solidified my passion for big data and quantitative research in finance. I believe that my understanding of financial markets, solid skills, perseverance and hard work will help me achieve success in this field. If you are looking to hire a Summer quant intern who is strong in coding and stochastic models, and passionate about the fixed income market, feel free to directly message me or email me at jiachen9@andrew.cmu.edu.  

Fun Fact: My biggest hobby is swimming. I have been working as a teaching assistant for applied time series for the past two years.
