#  Academics 
A cornerstone of our graduate education is research with a focus on advancing knowledge and finding meaningful solutions to significant problems of society. This real-world, hands-on approach has made CMU home to excellent faculty and students in engineering, computer science, the natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, business administration and the fine arts.
This philosophy has also been the basis for interdisciplinary study and research to an extent that is rarely found elsewhere. CMU houses a myriad of interdisciplinary research facilities that combine expertise in diverse fields to produce exciting new areas of exploration.
Our commitment to diversity in our research and in supporting our diverse community truly makes CMU a unique place to carry out your graduate education. Whether students are looking for professional development opportunities, small project research grants or funding for conference attendance, CMU provides people, programs and resources for our students to succeed.
#  Admission and Application Process 
Each program manages their own separate admissions process, including deadlines and requirements, and this information varies by department. You are encouraged to visit the department's website in which you are interested to find specific details.
A student’s qualifications are not assessed until a full application has been received and processed. To learn more about your eligibility and how to apply, visit the department’s website in which you are interested. Some departments provide a few guidelines regarding the level of competitiveness. If provided, this would be found on the department website.
You are welcome to apply to more than one program, but in most cases you will need to complete separate applications for each. It is recommended not to assume that you can submit the exact same materials for each and to look closely at each program’s application requirements. Moreover, many departments have a list of FAQs that will address common issues, so if you are having technical difficulties with the application, check the department website and if the problem is not addressed on the website, contact the department directly.
Check the department website for an admission notification timeline or contact a department administrator to find out when you can expect a response regarding admissions.
All admissions-related questions, including where to submit transcripts, exam requirements, and how to set up a visit, should be directed to the department in which you are interested by visiting the college/school website linked in the Guide to Graduate Degrees and Programs section.
  

#  Tuition and Financial Support 
For the most part, students in the master's programs are self-supporting, and Ph.D. students are at least partially funded and encouraged to apply to fellowships. Each program makes their own arrangements regarding financial support of potential graduate students. Applicants should seek information from the department of interest for their specific opportunities. 
More information regarding tuition and fees can be found on the [Student Financial Services website](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/tuition/index.html). 
Visit the Funding Opportunities and Fellowships page to learn more about the centralized programs and resources that are in place for graduate student conference funding, small project research grants, professional engagement funding, and fellowship and scholarship opportunities, including the CMU Rales Fellows Program.
