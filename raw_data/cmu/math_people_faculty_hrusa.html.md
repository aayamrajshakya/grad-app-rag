#  Research 
Partial differential equations, integral equations, and calculus of variations are my main areas of research, with particular emphasis on problems that arise in continuum mechanics. Earlier efforts were devoted primarily to the mathematical theory of viscoelasticity, initial-boundary value problems in nonlinear elasticity, thermal effects in elasticity and viscoelasticity, and hyperbolic models for heat conduction.
Current research is focused on Lavrentiev’s phenomenon in the calculus variations, i.e. with situations in which the infimum for a given variational problem is sensitive to the precise degree of regularity that is assumed for the competing functions.
Recently, I have taken on a number of undergraduate research students. The projects have been in calculus of variations and mathematical finance.
