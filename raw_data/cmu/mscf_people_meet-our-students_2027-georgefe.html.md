## Bio
I believe the best careers ignite both talent and passion, and for me, that means systematically uncovering market opportunities through research.
I earned my bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics from NYU. I not only gained a solid foundation in the two technical fields underpinning quant finance but also experienced the power of data through a selection of electives in machine learning, big data, and math modeling.
I began my career at Millennium Management as a software engineer. There, I had the chance to craft powerful research tools for the firm’s equity trading teams around the globe. Additionally, I witnessed firsthand the synergy among programming, math, and finance through collaborations with quant strategy experts in building a portfolio monitoring system. More recently, I conducted research and development on LLM-enabled products designed to enhance equity research workflows. These experiences reinforced my passion for pushing the boundaries of both myself and the industry.
At CMU, I look forward to further strengthening my knowledge in financial modeling and insight mining. Combining the rigorous academic training with my experience in this fast-paced and high-stakes industry, I am ready to take on the next challenge.
