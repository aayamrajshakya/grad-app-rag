## Financial aid
Financial aid is awarded upon admission in the form of research assistantships based upon departmental resources and available openings. If available, financial aid is awarded for both the fall and spring semesters. There is not a special financial aid form.
Virtually all graduate students in the Ph.D. program receive financial aid, in the form of fellowships, that cover tuition, fees, and reasonable living expenses for the entire year. Thus, students can concentrate on course work and research without financial concerns or interruptions. All Ph.D. applicants are considered for financial aid with no special form required. Only students in the Ph.D. program can be considered for departmental financial support in the form of tuition, stipend, and health insurance.
Students in chemical engineering master's programs are ineligible to receive departmental fellowships that cover tuition and living expenses. Master's students are primarily self-supported but may be eligible to receive partial financial support in the form of external scholarships and [other funding opportunities.](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/funding/index.html) There is sometimes also [campus employment](https://www.cmu.edu/career/student-employment/for-students/index.html) available.
