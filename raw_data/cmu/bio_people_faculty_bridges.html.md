#  Research 
In the Bridges lab, we study how bacteria make developmental decisions based on extracellular sensory information. The developmental program on which we focus is the formation and disassembly of multicellular bacterial communities called biofilms. Previously, we pioneered the use of new imaging approaches to investigate the full biofilm lifecycle in the global pathogen, Vibrio cholerae, from initial cell attachment to biofilm growth, to biofilm disassembly. Because little was known about how biofilm disassembly occurs, to date, we have concentrated primarily on this phase of the process. We combine imaging approaches with techniques including genetics, biochemistry, and biophysics theory to discover and characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling biofilm dispersal.
The Bridges lab recently launched in the historic Mellon Institute building at Carnegie Mellon University as of September 2022. Our group will investigate how bacteria control lifestyle changes across scales: from the signaling molecules, to the signal transduction circuits, to the individual cell, to the community. In the long term, our research program will expand to other microorganisms and their unique lifestyles to learn what principles are general and which are species-specific. Our discoveries will be relevant to infection and could inform the development of approaches to manipulate bacterial behavior, potentially leading to new strategies for controlling disease. We strive to create an engaging, diverse, inclusive, and immersive intellectual atmosphere for trainees. Join us on the adventure!
