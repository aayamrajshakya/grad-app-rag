# Laboratory Methods for Computational Biologists
## Course Number: 02-760 
Computational biologists frequently focus on analyzing and modeling large amounts of biological data, often from high-throughput assays or diverse sources. It is therefore critical that students training in computational biology be familiar with the paradigms and methods of experimentation and measurement that lead to the production of these data. This one-semester laboratory course has been developed to give students a deep appreciation of the principles and challenges of biological experimentation. Students will explore a range of topics, including structural biology, genomics, proteomics, and bioimaging. Each broad topic is covered over a period of 3-4 weeks. Many lectures and labs are hosted by faculty who are experts in the field. Students are required to keep a detailed laboratory notebook, summarizing the goals of the experiment, critical steps, and analysis of the resulting data. With an emphasis on instrumentation and high-throughput data collection, this course is appropriate for students who have never taken a traditional undergraduate biology lab course, as well as those who have. Grading: Letter grade based on class participation, take-home exams, and a final project.
This course is specifically for CPCB Ph.D. students. Any other students interested in taking the course need Instructor permission.
