## Mission Statement
The BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are designed for students who want to turn talent and passion into viable professions for the future through a challenging academic curriculum. BXA students pursue their goals with the help of multifaceted advising, innovative pedagogical strategies and a focus on the impact arts have on technology and vice versa. 
The goal of the Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA), the Bachelor of Engineering Studies and Arts (BESA), the Bachelor of Humanities and Arts (BHA), the Bachelor of Science and Arts (BSA) and the additional major in Engineering and Arts (EA), housed under the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs, is to allow a select group of students who demonstrate interest and accomplishment in the fine arts and computer science, engineering, humanities, social sciences or natural sciences to explore beyond the traditional academic major, or integrate more than one field of study across disciplines. These programs foster the creativity of students who explore innovative approaches to the academic environments of two colleges. By merging the components in the arts and computer science, engineering, natural sciences or humanities into an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary study, a unique, complex product is born. BXA students produce new information, challenging questions and innovative theory. BXA students are models of independence, motivation and well-rounded scholarship as humanists, scientists and artists at the same time. 
In the context of the Carnegie Mellon University environment, the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs hold a special role. BXA provides access to five strong colleges that offer specialized training with expert faculty and researchers. The BXA Programs challenge students to utilize those resources as they explore and develop their own approach to interdisciplinary studies in the fine arts and computer science, engineering, humanities and social sciences, or the natural and mathematical sciences.
BXA students balance courses in their CFA concentration with courses in their academic concentration, as well as BXA-specific courses. These BXA-specific courses give students the opportunity to integrate their areas of concentration by focusing on interdisciplinary approaches and arts-based research techniques. The curricula in the concentration areas provide students with a solid disciplinary foundation upon which they can draw for interdisciplinary projects. 
A BXA intercollege degree prepares students for graduate study and careers in an enormous variety of fields, including traditional graduate training in the arts as well as academic areas, positions in arts and education non-profits such as museums and foundations, and technical positions with media and technology companies.
## Program Objectives
The skills developed by BXA students span the creative, the technical, the academic and the practical. The objective of the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs is to prepare graduates for careers in which they will draw on their creative and academic skills to create, educate, communicate and innovate across disciplines. 
Students who complete the BXA curriculum will graduate with the following skills:
  * Foundational knowledge and technical expertise in the CFA concentration area and the DC/ENG/MCS/SCS concentration area
  * Ability to describe the connections between these concentrations and how the student integrates them
  * Ability to communicate ideas textually, visually and orally
  * Knowledge of how the concentration disciplines intersect with history, society and culture from local and global perspectives
  * Ability to use cognitive, behavioral and ethical dimensions within the concentration disciplines to make decisions on individual and social levels
  * Experience in engaging in art research to produce new knowledge both within the CFA concentration and the DC/ENG/MCS/SCS concentration
  * Experience in designing, researching and completing a large-scale, object-based project that integrates both areas of concentration


## Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts Degree Program
The Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts (BCSA) intercollege degree program combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the School of Computer Science (SCS). This degree provides an ideal technical, critical and conceptual foundation for students interested in pursuing fields that comprehensively meld technology and the arts, such as game design, computer animation, computer music, recording technologies, interactive stagecraft, robotic art and other emerging media. Students choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: [Architecture](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-arch), [Art](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-art), [Design](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-design), [Drama](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-drama) or [Music](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-music). Students choose their [computer science](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-cs) concentration established by the School of Computer Science.
The BCSA curriculum has three main components: [general education requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-gen-ed), [fine arts concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-cfa) and [computer science concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bcsa-cs). Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and SCS. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in SCS to guide their focus in computer science.

## Bachelor of Engineering Studies and Arts Degree Program
The Bachelor of Engineering Studies and Arts (BESA) intercollege degree program combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the College of Engineering (ENG). This degree is tailored for students seeking to apply knowledge from duel fields to advance maker culture in novel and creative ways. Students choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: [Architecture](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-arch), [Art](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-art), [Design](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-design), [Drama](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-drama) or [Music](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-music). Students choose their engineering studies concentration established by the College of Engineering. Options within the concentration include: [biomedical engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-bme), [chemical engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-cheme), [civil & environmental engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-cive), [electrical & computer engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-ece), [materials science & engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-mse) or [mechanical engineering](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-meche).
The BESA curriculum has three main components: [general education requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-gen-ed), [fine arts concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-cfa) and [engineering studies concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#besa-eng). Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and ENG. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in ENG to guide their focus in engineering studies.

## Bachelor of Humanities and Arts Degree Program
The Bachelor of Humanities and Arts (BHA) intercollege degree program combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences (DC). This degree is designed for academically and artistically talented students who want to develop their interest in the fine arts, while also pursuing studies in the humanities and social/behavioral sciences. Students choose their fine arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: [Architecture](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-arch), [Art](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-art), [Design](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-design), [Drama](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-drama) or [Music](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-music). Students choose their [humanities and social sciences concentration](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-dc) from the subject areas offered by DC. The most important aspect of the BHA program is for students to blend their interests and to explore the connections between their chosen disciplines. The program also provides enough flexibility for students to broaden or deepen their concentrations and to explore other areas in which they may be interested. 
The BHA curriculum has three main components: [general education requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-gen-ed), [fine arts concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-cfa) and [humanities/social sciences concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bha-dc). Students must complete an array of courses defined by their chosen concentrations. Each student's course of study is unique, based on their background and interests, and course availability in the respective colleges.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and DC. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in DC to guide their focus in the humanities or social/behavioral sciences.

#####  Behavioral Economics Concentration
(81 units minimum)
The new major of BE—the first of its kind among US undergraduate institutions—was designed to rigorously train students in the field of Behavioral Economics and to encourage them to critically consider its relevance to policy and organizations. The major emphasizes both theory and the practical promise of BE to solve problems of importance to policy makers and organizations through the largest undergraduate selection of BE courses of any university in the world. Towards this end, students will learn to collect original data, design field and laboratory experiments, analyze data and draw causal inferences, and develop interventions to improve economic outcomes and decisions. The core requirements include courses in Economics, Psychology, Behavioral Economics, and quantitative methods—including experimental design and econometrics. Students who complete the major will be well positioned to enter the private sector in a role involving data or people analytics, marketing, corporate strategy, or human resources, or to enter a wide range of graduate degree programs.

###### Cognitive Science Elective (1 course, 9 units)
Choose one elective in consultation with your concentration advisor.
#####  Creative Writing Concentration
(81 units minimum)
In the Creative Writing concentration, BHA students develop their talents in writing fiction, poetry and other imaginative forms. While studying with faculty members who are practicing poets and prose writers, students read widely in literature, explore the resources of their imaginations, sharpen their critical and verbal skills and develop a professional attitude toward their writing. The Creative Writing program is based on a conservatory model, made up of faculty and students who have an intense commitment to their work.
Students in the Creative Writing concentration are required to take two of the introductory genre writing courses, ideally in their sophomore year. Choices include Introduction to Writing Poetry ([76-265](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-265 "76-265")), Introduction to Writing Fiction ([76-260](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-260 "76-260")), Introduction to Screenwriting ([76-269](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-269 "76-269")) and Introduction to Writing Nonfiction ([76-261](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-261 "76-261")). In order to proceed into the upper level courses in the concentration (and in each of the genres), students must do well in these introductory courses (receive a grade of A or B). After completing the introductory genre writing courses, students take four workshops in fiction, poetry, screenwriting or nonfiction. At least two of the workshops must be taken in a single genre. Workshops may be taken more than once for credit. In the writing workshops, students develop their critical and verbal abilities through close writing and analysis of poems, stories and other literary forms. Their work is critiqued and evaluated by peers and the faculty.

#####  Cybersecurity & International Conflict Concentration
(81 units minimum)
The BHA concentration in cybersecurity and international conflict, offered by the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology (CMIST), analyzes the past, present, and future role of cyber conflict and cybersecurity in international politics. Cyber attacks by nation-states and their proxies have an important impact upon conflict. The complexity and policy challenges of cyber-engagements is immense. This minor addresses the role of deterrence, dissuasion, and attribution in cyber conflict, while also studying the nuances of key components of modern warfare—from the security dilemma to escalation management.
Courses in this concentration focus on the existing gaps in our understanding of cybersecurity and international conflict, such as whether cyberspace is offense or defense dominant (or over time fluid between the two), and which factors are important in determining the answer to this. Other relevant questions include how nation-states, their primary adversaries, and a bevy of nonstate actors engage online and in the virtual and information environments. Accordingly, the concentration exposes students to basic technology concepts, methods of attack and defense, potential strategy and goals for cyber-engagement, and response and forensics for cyber-engagements.
Alongside conventional methods of warfare, cybersecurity has rapidly developed into a centerpiece of a state’s ability to project power. As the United States and other emerging cyber powers craft and implement doctrine in this domain, there is likely to be a rapid increase in activity, from efforts to disrupt the online activities of global terrorist networks, to cybersecurity offense and defense in the Russia-Ukraine war, to near daily raids on foreign networks designed to cripple states’ cyberweapons before they can be deployed. In addition, the impact of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure, theft of intellectual property, pervasive identity theft, and hacking of sensitive databases have accumulated, gradually wearing down civilian networks and achieving strategic effects over time.
In the shifting landscape of cyber capabilities, how will laws, authorities, and policies keep pace? What are the implications and consequences of actions that may be considered “short of war” by some countries but “above the threshold” of conflict by others? Will a more aggressive defensive posture with respect to cybersecurity inadvertently increase the risk of conflict with states that sponsor malicious hacking groups? What is the proper balance between offense and defense in cybersecurity and how are cyber operations best integrated into a country’s overall military strategy?
Unlike other kinds of conflicts, attribution of attacks presents significant challenges. Indeed, in many cases, it can be difficult to determine whether the attacker is a nation-state, a nonstate actor, a criminal gang, or a lone hacktivist. Investigators must combine technical and traditional methods to identify potentially responsible parties and to understand their intent. If the aggressor’s identity cannot be confirmed, how can a counterattack be launched? Some attackers may seek to mount “false flag” attacks and deception, for example, that misdirect defenders to counter-attack in the wrong direction.
Additionally, what are appropriate responses to attacks made on civil infrastructure and private business operations, such as in the areas of financial services, transportation, energy, entertainment, and health care? In other words, what are the appropriate rules of engagement for national systems, infrastructural systems, businesses, and individuals? When, for example, is a counterattack or a “kinetic” response permissible?
These questions have major implications for the study of war and peace. Those who seek to start a war may be harder to find and their motives more difficult to discern. The cybersecurity and international conflict concentration tackles the social-scientific dimensions of cybersecurity with a focus on the implications of the cyber age for modern statecraft, warfare, elections (local, state, and national), and domestic and international politics.

##### **Ethics, History,& Public Policy Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
The BHA concentration in Ethics, History, & Public Policy (EHPP) prepares students to be leaders is a vital goal of colleges and universities in every democratic society. The intellectual challenges facing public and private sector leaders have expanded tically since the pioneering EHPP program began in 1996, but the need remains as great as ever for broadly educated, ethically sensitive, and technically skilled leaders.
EHPP prepares students to demonstrate sophistication and flexibility in their command of interdisciplinary knowledge; deep historical understanding of how modern-day policy problems have emerged and evolved; and clear, rational criteria for ethical and socially just decision making. The curriculum provides students with a strong humanistic foundation for developing such high-level, historically grounded, and ethically attuned leadership capacities. It also offers ample room for specialization in a wide range of policy areas in which the History and Philosophy departments have special expertise, e.g., medicine and public health, criminal justice, environment, technology, artificial intelligence (AI), gender, civil rights, immigration, and education.

###### French & Francophone Studies Electives (2 courses, 18 units)
In consultation with the concentration advisor, choose two additional courses related to French & Francophone Studies.
##### **German Studies Concentration**
(90 units minimum)
A BHA concentration in German Studies promotes not just language proficiency but also an understanding of German culture. Students who arrive at Carnegie Mellon with previous language study and/or who have high Advanced Placement, an International Baccalaureate, a Cambridge GCE Advanced level or internal placement exam scores will be able to begin taking courses in the concentration earlier in their undergraduate program. In all cases, progress in the concentration will be accelerated by study abroad, which is recommended for all students.
###### Prerequisites
Elementary-level proficiency in German. This is equivalent to the completion of two courses (at the 100-level) or may be demonstrated through CMU internal placement test scores.

In consultation with the concentration advisor, choose three additional courses taught in either German or English, for example, additional 400-level courses in German Studies or a departmental elective.
##### **Global Studies Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
The BHA concentration in Global Studies is designed for students interested in humanistic approaches to understanding past and present processes of globalization. Participating faculty in the departments of History, Languages, Cultures, and Applied Linguistics and English conduct research in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and the Pacific. The rigorous yet flexible Global Studies curriculum combines anthropology, history, literary and cultural studies, and advanced language training in order to help students make sense of complex interactions among global processes, regional and local cultures, and societal structures. BHA concentration students in Global Studies develop a broad understanding of their prospects and responsibilities as citizens of the world confronting challenging contemporary problems.
There are two required courses for the concentration: Introduction to Global Studies (79-275)Advanced Seminar in Global Studies (79-400)
In addition to coursework at Carnegie Mellon, BHA students with a concentration in Global Studies are encouraged to incorporate a semester of study abroad into their course of study in order to immerse themselves in society different from their own with unfamiliar cultural practices, language and history.
Students should consult frequently with the BHA advisor and the Global Studies concentration advisor who will help students to craft a coherent course of study on specific topics and/or regions that may lead to the capstone research project ([79-400](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=79-400 "79-400") Advanced Seminar in Global Studies ), the BXA capstone project ([52-401](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=52-401 "52-401") and [52-402](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=52-402 "52-402")) or a [Dietrich College senior honors thesis](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/students/undergraduate/programs/senior-honors/index.html). The concentration advisor will also work with students to connect their academic interests and their participation in student organizations and/or organizations based in Pittsburgh with transnational reach.
###### Global Studies Introductory and Capstone Courses (2 courses, 21 units)

#####  **Hispanic Studies** Concentration
(90 units minimum)
A BHA concentration in Hispanic Studies promotes not just language proficiency but also an understanding of its varied cultures. Students who arrive at Carnegie Mellon with previous language study and/or who have high Advanced Placement, an International Baccalaureate, a Cambridge GCE Advanced level or internal placement exam scores will be able to begin taking courses in the concentration earlier in their undergraduate program. In all cases, progress in the concentration will be accelerated by study abroad, which is recommended for all students.
###### Prerequisites
Intermediate-level proficiency in Spanish. This is equivalent to the completion of four courses (two at the 100-level and two at the 200-level) or may be demonstrated through CMU internal placement test scores.
###### Core Courses in Languages, Cultures and Applied Linguistics (LCAL) (1 course, 9 units)

###### Hispanic Studies Electives (5 courses, 45 units)
In consultation with the concentration advisor, choose five additional courses taught in Spanish at the 400-level or above. Students may substitute one relevant and related course from outside the program (i.e., another LCAL course) or from another department (e.g., History, CMIST, Philosophy, English). 
##### **Humanities Analytics Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
The human experience that is traditionally at the core of a humanities education is being dramatically transformed by the emergence of big data, digital platforms, computational thinking, and digital connectivity. Spurred by such developments, the concentration in Humanities Analytics (HumAn), offered by the Department of English, trains students in the processes involved in analyzing, digitizing, quantifying and visualizing different types of humanities and cultural phenomena, including printed books, manuscripts, historical records, art, music and film. The HumAn concentration trains students to work with cultural objects (like texts, film, historical records, etc.) but also to turn words and images into data; to move from one cultural object (like a Victorian novel, for instance) to a corpus consisting of tens of thousands of other novels published in the same period, and to combine close reading with distant reading (aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data) for maximum insight and accuracy.
Students will develop a broad technical understanding of state-of-the-art computer-assisted methods for humanistic study, such as: social network analysis, text analysis and data mining, topic modeling, classification techniques and visualization. Students will also investigate the histories and historical contexts of such methods, learning to consider their applicability in specific domains. Finally, students will learn to turn a critical eye on the corpora and infrastructures that increasingly underpin humanistic research.

##### **International Relations& Political Science Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
Offered through the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology (CMIST), the International Relations and Political Science (IRPS) BHA concentration is for students who want to learn how to think systematically and develop foundational knowledge about international and domestic politics. It is an interdisciplinary concentration that is rooted firmly in political science and draws on strengths and insights from decision science, economics, history, modern languages, and other fields. IRPS students wrestle with a wide range of issues including the future of democracy, the relationship between technology and politics, the drivers of war and peace, domestic politics across countries, and the formulation of effective foreign policies. IRPS graduates embark on a variety of careers in government, law, public policy, intelligence, national defense, consulting, international development, and more.
Core disciplinary courses for the IRPS major establish a strong foundation in the study of political science and enable students to better understand the workings of political institutions, political behavior across countries, the decision-making of political leaders, the making national and international policy, and prevailing challenges to the international system, among other topics.
Core methodology courses train IRPS students in the social science tools and communications skills needed to analyze and write persuasively about international relations and politics. Students pursuing an IRPS major learn to use a wide range of analytic tools including statistics and data science, qualitative analysis, game theory, and behavioral decision-making models as they study politics and strategy. Students also learn how to effectively communicate their analyses to affect public policy.
A rich set of electives allows students to investigate issues in security and technology, grand strategy and national security, cybersecurity and international conflict, military strategy and doctrine, the politics of key regions of the world, international political economy and economic policy, representation and voting rights, climate change and development, repression and human rights, international law and diplomacy, political psychology and public opinion, and social change and revolution.

A BHA concentration in Japanese Studies promotes not just language proficiency but also an understanding of Japanese culture. Students who arrive at Carnegie Mellon with previous language study and/or who have high Advanced Placement, an International Baccalaureate, a Cambridge GCE Advanced level or internal placement exam scores will be able to begin taking courses in the concentration earlier in their undergraduate program. In all cases, progress in the concentration will be accelerated by study abroad, which is recommended for all students.
###### Prerequisites
Low-intermediate-level proficiency in Japanese. This is equivalent to the completion of three courses (two at the 100-level and one at the 200-level) or may be demonstrated through CMU internal placement test scores.
###### Core Courses in Languages, Cultures and Applied Linguistics (LCAL) (1 course, 9 units)

##### **Linguistics Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
The BHA concentration in Linguistics combines courses from the departments of English, Languages, Cultures, and Applied Linguistics, Philosophy and Psychology and the Language Technologies Institute. Linguistics is the study of human language, and it encompasses a broad spectrum of research questions, approaches and methodologies. Some linguists are concerned with the cognitive aspects of language learning, production and comprehension; some are concerned with language as a social and cultural phenomenon; others engage in the analysis of linguistic form and meaning, some from a functional and others from a formal perspective. There are also computational approaches to linguistics with both applied and theoretical goals.

###### English Elective Courses (2 courses, 18 units)
Complete two additional courses from the English Department’s offerings. One course must be at the 300-level, and one must be at the 400-level. Electives may include any courses offered by the English Department from any specialization area, with the exception of creative writing workshops.
##### **Logic& Computation Concentration**
(81 units minimum)
Students in the program take a common core of courses in logic, methodology, and computer science, together with an associated seminar in their senior year. The individual focus is achieved by selecting a sequence of four advanced and closely related courses. It is in this area of focus (or specialization) that students write their senior thesis under the supervision of a faculty member.
The resulting education in logic, analytic philosophy, mathematics, statistics and computer science enables students to pursue professional careers or graduate study. The analytic and communication skills developed in the major support a wide range of career choices, including those among the fields of technology, business and law. Fields of graduate study for which students are well prepared include, for example, computer science, cognitive science, philosophy, logic and linguistics.

###### Area 6: Electives (3 courses, 27 units)
Three other philosophy courses, or appropriate courses from other departments, with the permission of the concentration advisor.
#####  Policy & Management Concentration
(87 units minimum)
The Policy & Management concentration prepares students for key decision-making and management roles in government, non-profit organizations and business. The concentration emphasizes analytical approaches to decision making, practical management skills and empirical techniques necessary for graduates to excel in the public and private sectors. The multidisciplinary curriculum merges frontier knowledge on the ideals of decision making, policy and data analysis, as well as the realities of individual behavior within various institutional settings that must be confronted if high-quality outcomes are to be attained.
The Policy & Management concentration provides an excellent combination of theoretical and practical skills for students who intend to seek managerial positions. Because of its strong analytic orientation, it is also an excellent concentration for those who intend to go on to professional school programs in law, business or public policy. It is also an appropriate choice for students pursuing graduate degrees in economics, political science or decision science.
###### Policy Core (2 courses, 18 units) 
The Policy Core gives students applied economic training and policy analysis experience. Students will gain an analytical understanding of some of the biggest domestic and global economic policy challenges, and gain an appreciation of the economic analysis of complex decisions, as well as the trade-off between economic and political-based decision making.

###### Management Core (3 courses, 30 units) 
The Management Core focuses on real-world applications of decision making. Students will develop an understanding of effective negotiation strategies and tactics, and identify the barriers and the psychological factors that may prevent decision-makers from reaching wise agreements. The courses provide systematic methods for dealing with the complexities that make decisions difficult, ranging from incorporating issues of risk and uncertainty in decision making to dealing with choices that have mutually conflicting objectives. For example, a business or government agency may need to decide on a policy for mitigating the uncertain impacts of air pollution while simultaneously trying to minimize the costs of such a policy on manufacturing. A firm might want to consider the uncertain reductions in security dangers from alternative policies to protect against terrorism.

The Empirical Core focuses on key methods for collecting and analyzing data that are needed to make informed decisions. Students learn to use interviews, surveys, experiments and econometric methods to enhance their ability to test existing, and design new policies. Students will create statistical models to address questions asked in conceptual, computational and data-driven investigations.

#####  Politics & Public Policy Concentration
(81 units minimum)
Rooted in the discipline of political science, the concentration in Politics and Public Policy investigates US public policy issues and matters of American politics and law while providing students hands-on and practical learning experiences. Students pursuing the Politics and Public Policy concentration must participate in the [Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program (CMU/WSP)](https://www.cmu.edu/ips/washington-dc-semester-program/index.html) for one semester during their undergraduate years.
The CMU/WSP, sponsored by the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology (CMIST), is a semester-long program in which students live, intern, and take CMU classes in Washington, DC. Students earn 48 units for the Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program, interning about twenty-four hours per week in any sector or field of interest within Washington, DC, while taking classes on American politics, public policy, and law taught by Carnegie Mellon faculty.
From embassies to nongovernmental organizations, think tanks to advocacy organizations, government agencies to congressional offices, and consulting firms to media outlets, Washington, DC, is the center of US political, international, and public policy activities. Students in the program come into direct contact with policymakers, Congressmen, think tank leaders, and business leaders, and through hands-on experience learn about the most pressing policy issues of the day.
Through this experiential learning program, CMU/WSP participants develop professional and networking skills, explore how coursework connects to the real world, learn to give and receive constructive feedback in the workplace and classroom, and intentionally reflect on their learning and growth. Every CMU/WSP student is paired with a Washington, DC-based alumni mentor to share career advice and tips about life in DC. CMIST also sponsors events and policy-oriented opportunities in Washington for students participating in the program to further enrich their experience and enhance their understanding of how Washington functions as a hub of international and domestic policy decision making.

#####  Social & Political History Concentration
(84 units minimum)
The BHA concentration in Social & Political History focuses on new ways to understand the past and new ways to use what we know, as well as on connections between past and present and on how historical knowledge facilitates understanding of social, cultural and policy change. The History concentration emphasizes empirical methods and conceptual analysis, as well as specific research skills relevant to many types of jobs and further professional training. The History concentration combines a structured sequence of courses, training in research methods, theoretical concepts, and analytical writing skills, plus a considerable array of electives.
The BHA concentration in Social & Political History emphasizes broad-based, cumulative knowledge and interpretive skills in the study of the past. Offerings at the 200- and 300-level are designed to allow maximum flexibility in meeting requirements and maximum choice in focusing on particular themes, places, or eras. Upper-level courses aim to give students majoring in History more time together in smaller classes and more experience working with primary and secondary sources. The senior capstone seminar, Historical Research Seminar, provides training and experience in conducting original research and in interpretive, analytical writing—skills that prepare graduates for professional careers as well as for graduate or law school.

###### Electives (1 course, 9 units)
Students with a Technical Writing concentration take one course outside of English to deepen their area of specialty in their track. Students in the TC track typically select courses from business, design, psychology, and social and decision sciences, or HCI. Students in the SMC track select courses from the natural sciences, computer science, math or statistics, or (for example) healthcare-related courses in the Heinz School. Students should work with the Technical Writing concentration advisor to select courses that are meaningful for their track.

####  Free Electives
(approximately 1-7 courses, 1-63 units)
Take any Carnegie Mellon course. Many BHA students use their electives to broaden or deepen their concentrations. A maximum of 9 units of physical education and/or military science may be counted toward this requirement.
## Bachelor of Science and Arts Degree Program
The Bachelor of Science and Arts (BSA) intercollege degree program combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the Mellon College of Science (MCS). This degree is designed for students who are gifted in both the fine arts and the natural sciences or mathematics, and who have the interest and the exceptional ability to pursue both disciplines simultaneously. Students choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: [Architecture](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-arch), [Art](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-art), [Design](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-design), [Drama](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-drama) or [Music](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-music). Students choose their science concentration from among the departments in MCS: [Biological Sciences](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-bio), [Chemistry](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-chem), [Environmental & Sustainability Studies](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-ess), [Mathematical Sciences](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-math), [Neurobiology](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-neurobio) or [Physics](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-physics).
The BSA curriculum has three main components: [general education requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-gen-ed), [fine arts concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-cfa) and [natural sciences/mathematics concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#bsa-mcs). Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and MCS. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in MCS to guide their focus in the sciences.

####  Free Electives
(approximately 0-3 courses, 0-29 units)
Take any Carnegie Mellon course. A maximum of 9 units of physical education and/or military science may be counted toward this requirement. Physical education and military science courses will not be calculated in a student's QPA.
## Engineering and Arts Additional Major
The Engineering and Arts (EA) additional major combines the strengths of the College of Fine Arts (CFA) and the College of Engineering (ENG). This additional major provides students with formal practice and training in the creative arts that is more robust than a minor, as well as the foundation of interdisciplinary research to accomplish the integration of their interests. Students who currently have a primary major in engineering, choose their arts concentration from the following schools in CFA: [Architecture](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-arch), [Art](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-art), [Drama](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-drama) or [Music](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-music).
The EA curriculum has two main components: [BXA requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-bxa) and [fine arts concentration requirements](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/intercollegeprograms/bxaintercollege/#ea-cfa). Each student's course of study is structured so it can be completed alongside their primary engineering major.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the advisors and liaisons between CFA and Engineering. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and their primary advisor in Engineering to guide their full major in engineering.

## Academic Policies
#### Academic Standards
The College of Fine Arts seeks to support each of our students on their pathway towards graduation. Thus, we review each student’s academic performance and progress towards degree at the close of each semester. Academic actions are designed to notify a student of specific academic and graduation requirements, outline goals for completion, and identify avenues of support. Academic actions are opportunities for students to reflect, grow, and get connected with appropriate campus resources to help them succeed.
To stay on track for graduation, each student is expected to complete a minimum of 38* units each semester, have both a semester and cumulative QPA of at least 2.0, pass at least 80% of their attempted units for the semester, as well as to make adequate academic progress towards their declared degree.Adequate progress requires that a student registers for and passes all of their degree’s critical coursework as defined in each program’s curriculum.
To remain in good academic standing a student must achieve the following criteria:
  1. Pass at least 80% of attempted units in the current semester.
  2. Achieve a minimum QPA of 2.0 both in the current semester and cumulatively.
  3. Make adequate academic progress towards their declared degree as defined by their degree track.


In order to make adequate academic progress, BXA students must complete the required courses determined by their CFA concentration. If a student does NOT make progress towards their designated degree path they will receive an academic notification. [See CFA Handbook](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/collegeoffinearts/#academicstandardstextcontainer) for specifics concerning academic standards, academic policies, and the academic action sequence.
Incomplete grades will be conditionally actioned by the default grades until the student completes the missing coursework. If the student does not complete their missing coursework by the faculty deadline agreed upon, their default grade and action will become permanent. 
*Students approved for Part Time Status through the Office of Disability Resources will work with their Program’s administration to determine the minimum number of units needed to remain in Good Standing.
* * *
#### Disabilities
Students with a learning disability or a physical disability are encouraged to email access@andrew.cmu.edu. The circumstances will remain confidential to the extent desired. The university has a formal procedure for documenting disabilities, notifying advisors and faculty, and making arrangements to utilize university resources in support of expressed needs, but will take no action until contacted by the student. The BXA academic advisors will work with the student to coordinate assistance. Please note that requests for accommodations are not
* * *
#### Grading Policies
University grading policies may vary depending on the particular school/department. Please consult the [Undergraduate Academic Regulations](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/servicesandoptions/undergraduateacademicregulations/).
* * *
#### Intercollege Deans’ List 
Students who earn 36 graded units (no “pass/no pass” grades) with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher, no “incompletes” and “no grades” qualify for BCSA, BESA, BHA or BSA Deans’ List. The BXA Intercollege Deans’ List Honors are posted online each semester.
* * *
#### Intercollege Honors
BXA students who successfully complete a BXA Capstone Project under the guidance of a faculty member will graduate with BCSA, BESA, BHA, BSA or EA Intercollege Honors if all of the following conditions are met:
  * grade of “A” achieved in 62-401 and 62-402;
  * overall QPA of 3.25 or higher;
  * publicly present research results.


As a citizen of two colleges, a BXA student also has the opportunity to graduate with CFA College Honors, DC College Honors, ENG College Honors, MCS College Honors and SCS College Honors. These particular honors are defined by each college. BXA students will receive honors color cords during Commencement Weekend.
* * *
#### University Honors
Students who graduate with an overall QPA of 3.5 or higher will graduate with University Honors. Students will receive an honors medallion during Commencement Weekend.
* * *
#### Internal Transfer/Additional Major Process
For current Carnegie Mellon students who wish to apply to a BXA program, an [internal transfer](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/apply/internal-transfer.html) and [additional major](https://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/apply/additional-major.html) (EA) application process takes place in both the fall and spring semester. Applications are available online and are reviewed by a committee of BCSA, BESA, BHA, BSA and EA associate deans and advisors in October and in March. However, certain concentrations consider applications only once a year or certain concentrations only consider applicants currently enrolled in the same major as the intended concentration; please consult with a BXA advisor for guidance on scheduling your application.
All students applying for internal transfer should meet with their current advisor, a BXA advisor and an advisor in their target area, as well as take preliminary coursework in their target area and  before applying. For all concentrations, there are required courses that must be taken before an application will be considered; please consult with a BXA advisor for guidance on scheduling these courses. Additionally, a cumulative QPA of 3.0 is required for all BXA programs and s
Current BXA students who wish to change their BXA program (e.g. BHA to BCSA) or change their CFA concentration (e.g BHA architecture to BHA art) or delineated options within CFA concentrations (e.g. music performance to music composition) must apply for that change through the internal transfer process. Current BESA, BHA and BSA students who wish to change their academic college concentration after declaring (e.g. BHA creative writing to BHA psychology, BSA physics to BSA mathematical sciences) or delineated options within their academic college concentration (e.g. BESA chemical engineering to BESA mechanical engineering) after declaring must submit a new BESA ENG/BHA DC/BSA MCS Concentration Declaration form for approval of that change. Current BXA students seeking internal transfer out of BXA into another college program must apply and meet entry requirements to that program. Students who do not remain in BCSA can only return to their original major.
* * *
#### Study Abroad
Studying abroad is encouraged to broaden BXA students’ interdisciplinary experiences through traditional and non-traditional study abroad, from coursework and artistic studios to for-credit internships, volunteer service and research opportunities. 
Courses taken while studying abroad may count toward your BXA concentration requirements, your general education requirements or your free electives. Studying abroad should not delay your graduation, as long as you work with your study abroad advisor and your BXA advisor to plan the most appropriate courses.
The timing and length of program are important considerations while planning. Due to required BXA coursework, students should avoid studying abroad in their last three semesters (junior spring, senior fall/spring). Spending an entire year abroad is not typically possible for BXA students without intending to take an additional semester at Carnegie Mellon. Many students study abroad during the spring of their sophomore year or the fall semester of their junior year, as well during the summer, and over winter and spring breaks. Talk to your BXA academic advisor early in your academic career to identify the best time for study abroad. 
When studying abroad, students are still enrolled at Carnegie Mellon. A student never takes a leave of absence to study abroad. Prior to studying abroad, all students must attend a required pre-departure orientation offered by the Office of International Education (OIE).
Students must also complete a Study Abroad Transfer Credit (SATC) form prior to departure for study abroad, which must be signed after completion by the BXA advisor. The SATC will guarantee transfer credit for courses taken abroad, and is filled out by the corresponding departments to the coursework being transferred. Unlike regular transfer credit, there is no limit to the number of courses transferable from study abroad, but there may exist stricter limits on the use of coursework to fulfill concentration or general education requirements.
Students will receive credit for courses for which they receive a grade of “C” or better. However, grades received abroad do not count toward a student’s Carnegie Mellon University QPA.
Students who are on academic action may have restrictions from participating in some school, college, and university activities, including eligibility for study abroad.
* * *
#### Transfer Credit
Once a BXA student enrolls at Carnegie Mellon University as a degree candidate, they may transfer a maximum of five courses from another institution (excepting official study abroad programs through the CMU Office of International Education) for credit towards their BXA degree. This applies to courses taken at other institutions in the United States, as well as courses taken internationally in the student’s home country. 
Individual departments may impose stricter limits regarding the number or type of courses students propose to take elsewhere to fulfill requirements. Some departments may not accept transfer credit from online courses. 
Students must have prior approval to transfer courses from their BXA advisor, as well as concentration advisors, to use coursework towards requirements. To receive permission, students must provide course information (syllabi) to the corresponding department for evaluation of appropriate credit. When the course is finished, official transcripts must be sent to Carnegie Mellon University before credit will be recorded. 
Transfer courses must be taken for a letter grade and students must earn a C (2.00) or above (B or above at a community college). Transfer credit is not factored into a student's CMU QPA.
The following courses must be taken at CMU and cannot be transferred in:
  * First-Year Writing Requirement Course ([76-101](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-101 "76-101") Interpretation and Argument, [76-102](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-102 "76-102") Advanced First Year Writing: Special Topics, [76-106](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-106 "76-106") Writing about Literature, Art and Culture, [76-107](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-107 "76-107") Writing about Data, [76-108](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=76-108 "76-108") Writing about Public Problems)

Students currently on university suspension are permitted to take no more than three courses per semester at another institution and no more than a total of five courses.
* * *
#### Withdrawal or Leave of Absence
A student who decides to leave the university must meet with their BXA advisor and complete a [Withdrawal or Leave of Absence](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/registrar/leaves-and-returns/index.html) form. Withdrawal means leaving the university with no intention of returning. Leave of Absence means temporarily leaving the university with a stated intention to return. A withdrawal or leave of absence from the university at any time up to and including the last day of classes (excluding the final examination period), means that grades of W will be recorded for all classes for the semester. Financial responsibility for the semester is dependent upon the date of and the reasons for filing the form. Questions about financial responsibility should be directed to the HUB.
A leave of absence may be voluntary or involuntary. If the leave is voluntary, the student may return any time within four years following the beginning of the leave by filing an Application for Return from Leave of Absence form. If the leave is involuntary, that is, required for academic or disciplinary reasons, the conditions for return will be stated.
##### About Course Numbers:
Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix that designates the department offering the course (i.e., 76-xxx courses are offered by the Department of English). Although each department maintains its own course numbering practices, typically, the first digit after the prefix indicates the class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore level, etc. Depending on the department, xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or graduate-level, and xx-7xx courses and higher are graduate-level. Consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.

## BXA Intercollege Degree Programs Courses 

52-190 BXA Seminar I: Building the Wunderkammer
    Fall: 4.5 units  
BXA Seminar I considers how knowledge is represented across different modes of mediawhat language, what symbols, what logic guides knowledge acquisition and expression in your varied disciplines? Students engage with theoretical and practical readings from across disciplines, with particular emphasis on interpretive theory. Weekly readings in aesthetic and critical theory introduce students to a particular vocabulary of analysis, practiced in class discussion and written responses. Students will conceive, research, produce and present a creative final project at the end of the course.  


52-291 BXA Seminar II: Transferring Knowledge
    Spring: 4.5 units  
BXA Seminar II considers how interdisciplinary work can be produced, analyzed, justified andmost importantlycontextualized. By taking a deep dive into a single object or text, we'll explore how context situates the creator, the audience, and their relationship. At the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of how disciplinary methods establish context, and they'll be able to use this understanding to help guide their academic choices.  


52-292 BXA Student Advisory Council
    Intermittent: 3 units  
This course will provide opportunities for students to promote and refine the mission of the BXA programs. Students will develop and practice leadership skills, including collaboration, communication, and project management. Students will be responsible for planning and running BXA student events, including info sessions, social hours, skills workshops, and alumni events. Students are encouraged to think about how to engage other interdisciplinary scholars and artists as well as how to present their own work and programs to the larger university community.  


52-390 BXA Undergraduate Research Project
    All Semesters  
The BXA Undergraduate Research Project is for BXA students who want to work on a self-designed project with the one-to-one guidance of a faculty advisor. The project should be interdisciplinary in nature, and can be a scholarly and/or creative endeavor. The project may take the form of a written thesis, a compilation of creative works, an outreach project, etc. The project topic must be pre-approved by the faculty member who agrees to supervise the project and assign a letter grade for the course. Projects are to be completed in one semester, may be worth 3, 6, 9, or 12 units of academic credit, and cannot be taken concurrently with the BXA Capstone Project during the senior year. To register, students must submit an "Undergraduate Research Project Proposal Form" signed by both the student and the faculty advisor, along with a proposal, to their BXA academic advisor.  


52-392 BXA Seminar III: Deconstructing Disciplines
    Spring: 9 units  
BXA Seminar III is in preparation for the BXA Capstone Project and/or other senior research projects (Dietrich/MCS/SCS thesis, or CFA senior studio work). The seminar will engage BXA juniors in a brief examination of the structures of disciplinary knowledge, interdisciplinary approaches, and the components of research, with production of original work as the primary class requirement. The course is designed with maximum flexibility for various schedule conflicts and attendance; check course syllabus for meeting times and options. Coursework includes short readings and self-assessment exercises, participation in seminar discussions, preparation of the Junior Portfolio and professional documents (CV), and the production of new research or creative works. These can take one of three forms: 1) a small proof of concept object 2) the initiation of one stage of larger research plans or 3) a complete Capstone proposal. Any of these may be the basis of the student's eventual Capstone or other senior work. The requirements for this semester also include a short 5 page literature review about the student's topic, inclusion of work during the BXA Kaleidoscope show (last week of April), and a class research presentation showcase held during the final exam period.  


52-401 BXA Seminar IV: Capstone Project Research
    Fall and Spring  
The BXA Capstone gives BXA students the opportunity to demonstrate the extent of their interdisciplinary work over the course of their academic career. The Capstone should include elements that span the student's CFA and SCS concentrations (for BCSA students), CFA and engineering studies concentrations (for BESA students), CFA and DC concentrations (for BHA students), CFA and MCS concentrations (for BSA students), or CFA concentration and engineering major (for EA additional major students). The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.). The BXA Capstone sequence covers both semesters of a student's senior year. In the fall, students are enrolled in [52-401](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=52-401 "52-401") BXA Seminar IV: Capstone Project Research (9 units), which meets weekly to discuss strategies for managing research, planning the project, and larger theoretical issues related to interdisciplinary work. At the end of the fall course, students will have produced a Capstone Project proposal, an annotated bibliography, and multiple versions of their project pitch. In the spring, students enroll in [52-402](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=52-402 "52-402") BXA Seminar: Capstone Project Production (9 units), which has no required classroom time. Instead, students spend the semester doing the research and foundational work necessary for the project, as well as meeting with their faculty and BXA advisors as they create their Capstone Project and prepare to present it at the annual Meeting of the Minds Undergraduate Research Symposium held each May. Students will only be enrolled for 18 units when they are unable to complete a two-semester sequence and need to gain special permission by the BXA Director/Academic Advisor. The BXA Capstone sequence is for students in their last two semesters before graduation.  


52-402 BXA Seminar V: Capstone Project Production
    Fall and Spring: 9 units  
The BXA Capstone gives BXA students the opportunity to demonstrate the extent of their interdisciplinary work over the course of their academic career. The Capstone should include elements that span the student's CFA and SCS concentrations (for BCSA students), CFA and DC concentrations (for BHA students), CFA and MCS concentrations (for BSA students), or CFA concentration and engineering major (for EA additional major students). The project can be either a scholarly or creative endeavor, and may take one of many possible forms (e.g., a written thesis, a compilation of creative work or works, an experiment and report, a computer program or animation, etc.).

52-590 BXA Internship
    All Semesters  
An internship is a supervised professional work experience with clear links to a student's academic goals. BXA students may choose to complete a BXA Internship for elective credit with appropriate individuals or organizations within or outside of Carnegie Mellon University. Junior and senior BXA students in good academic standing are eligible to receive academic credit for one internship. Grading is pass/no pass only. Prior to enrolling in an internship, the student must have a "BXA Internship Agreement Form" signed by their site supervisor and approved by their BXA academic advisor.
