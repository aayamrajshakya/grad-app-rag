If you're interested in IT, data analytics, or cybersecurity, our IT Lab cybersecurity program
The IT Lab is a program for rising college seniors. This program is designed for U.S. citizens and permanent residents interested in pursuing graduate degrees and careers in the information security sector.
Students who complete IT Lab and are later admitted to a master’s program at Heinz College will be eligible to receive a scholarship of at least 50% of tuition.
## what is the it lab cybersecurity program?
The IT Lab: Summer Security Intensive is an all-expenses-paid, seven-week cybersecurity fellowship
  * Study with the world’s best security, analytics, and policy researchers, including the CERT division of the Software Engineering Institute
  * Take three specialized courses in security analytics and policy, with the ability to transfer those credits to your undergraduate institution
  * Apply knowledge, skills, and abilities gained via experiential learning to improve the cybersecurity posture of local organizations
  * Visits from leading security and analytics practitioners 


## IT Lab Projects
* * *
During the seven-week summer cybersecurity program, students will participate in a group project, fulfilling an actual business or operational need for our partners.
  * [ ](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/itlab/# "Recent Projects")
###### **United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) and the National Security Innovation Network (NSIN)**
Students worked with USSTRATCOM subject-matter experts to research and recommend strategies to address the following policy and technical challenge problems:
    * What is the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in deterring strategic or existential attacks?
    * What could break deterrence in the 21st century? What could strengthen deterrence?
    * What is the efficacy of multi-domain deterrence in an economically competitive environment?
    * How might cyber-attacks on Nuclear Command, Control and Communications (NC3) systems introduce doubt in the reliability and effectiveness of an actor’s NC3 systems?
###### Department of Homeland Security Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the National Risk Management Center (NRMC)
    * Students developed a comprehensive inventory of lists, historical compilations, and trends of cybersecurity incidents.
    * Students developed a comprehensive inventory of metrics used to describe cybersecurity incidents and how they are reported.
    * Students developed a profile of model organizations that produce metrics/statistics today.
    * Students developed an anatomy of a complex cyber incident as an exemplar use case.
###### Carnegie Mellon University CISO Office
    * Students assisted in the development and documentation of the control/maturity framework and process indicators for the implementation of a business resiliency program aligned to the ISO 22301 Societal security -- Business continuity management systems international standard.
    * Students developed and deployed data analytics and visualization tools for security monitoring at Carnegie Mellon University. Deliverables included building dashboards using the ‘glass table’ functionality of Splunk for Enterprise Security.
###### Allegheny Health Choices, INC.
    * Students conducted a feasibility study of the implementation of blockchain technologies to protect health care data with Allegheny Health Choices.
###### Consortium for Public Education
    * Students performed a vulnerability assessment of the technology currently used by the Consortium for Public Education. The assessment documented a technology baseline along with recommendations for a strategic plan for long-term technology investments.
###### Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh
    * Students developed a technical training curriculum for the Pittsburgh Public School District to prepare students for continuing education or entry into the Information Security workforce.
###### Pittsburgh Mercy
    * Students developed a security strategy for Pittsburgh Mercy to define organizational policy for the selection, support, and security of technology around mobile computing.
###### Allegheny Digital
    * Students examined smart home automation technologies to further understand information security and data privacy risks, such as data leakage and ease of compromise. The IT Lab project team developed technical countermeasures to minimize the threat surface, providing consumers with greater control over the data their smart home is storing, processing, and transmitting.
###### National Cyber Forensic Training Alliance (NCFTA)
    * Students developed a comprehensive written Information Security Plan that articulates and documents the organization’s administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for the protection of all information and data maintained, including information maintained on behalf of third parties. The plan recommended procedures for evaluating electronic and physical methods of accessing, collecting, storing, using, transmitting, and protecting all information and data.
###### Nimbus Robotics
    * Students performed a security assessment on the IT infrastructure of the organization and evaluated the security of data collected, stored, and transmitted from bionic shoes produced by the company to Nimbus Robotics data repositories.

## IT lab alumni spotlight: Rachel Kang
"I loved computer science, I loved coding, but I still loved politics," Kang said. "What is a good blend between those two?" 
One of her classmates at Middlebury College recommended the IT Lab program to her, and off she went to Pittsburgh for the summer cybersecurity fellowship. That experience launched her cybersecurity career; she now works for OpenAI on their Intelligence and Investigations team.
Kang spent her summer in the IT Lab working on intrusion protection and detection systems and hearing experiences from a variety of information security professionals who visited students during IT Lab’s Lunch-and-Learn sessions.
"There was one particular individual, they were the CISO at Yahoo, who came and told us a riveting story about when Yahoo got breached," Kang said. "And I just thought, 'I couldn’t believe that she got paid to do that.'"
Kang went into cybersecurity consulting after college and found the insider threat projects the most fun. “And so when this offer came in with OpenAI, I knew that I had to join,” she said. “AI was a big buzzword and there’s been a lot of push to get more security around AI, so I couldn’t pass up this perfect opportunity for me.”
