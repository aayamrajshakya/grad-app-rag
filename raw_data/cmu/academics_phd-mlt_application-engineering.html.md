# Application Engineering Courses
Ph.D., MLT, and 5LT students must take at least one course that satisfies an Application Engineering requirement. Application Engineering courses provide experience using core language technologies to build software systems that tackle real-world applications. At least 50% of the course grade is based on homework assignments and projects that require significant software development.
Note for Ph.D. Students:
The courses that satisfy the Application Engineering requirement are listed below.
