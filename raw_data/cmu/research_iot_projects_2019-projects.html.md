### Securing Embedded Software
Today, we don't have security analysis that can find rounding errors and other critical bugs. Not a big deal for a webserver, but a huge deal for IoT devices found in cars, automobiles, and planes. We are research and developing new tools to help identify such problems and releasing our tools as open source at <https://github.com/binaryanalysisplatform/bap>

  * David Brumley, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)


### Toward a Smarthome IoT Infrastructure Free of Privacy Leaks and Software Vulnerabilities
The software components of home IoT ecosystems are often constructed from off-the-shelf components, like messaging libraries. This project examines to what extent use of such components introduces risks to users' data, including due improper configuration of and vulnerabilities in the off-the-shelf components. The project will both empirically quantify these risks and develop tools and guidance to avoid them.

### IoT Device Privacy and Security Nutrition Labels 
Our ongoing project is to design a privacy and security label for IoT devices based on inputs from privacy and security experts and follow-up user studies with average consumers. The label, which may appear online or on physical product packaging, will contain information about key privacy and security factors such as the types of data the device is collecting, the purpose of data collection, who the data is being shared with, the security update lifetime, the average response time to patch a found vulnerability, and whether or not the device is receiving signed and critical automatic updates. The labels are designed to educate consumers to make more informed IoT-related purchase decisions, allow for product comparisons based on privacy and security properties, and promote device manufacturer accountability for privacy and security.

### Wireless Physical Layer Security
This project aims to develop an authentication paradigm for extremely low-power wireless devices, the vast majority of connected devices in the Internet of Things. We aim to do so by learning unique hardware-specific imperfections that these radios inevitably manifest in the signals they transmit. The project aims to leverage these imperfections to tackle a wide range of security and privacy challenges in low-power networks.

##  Accountability
### Internet of Things Compliance Gaps Under New California Laws
The new California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) creates new rights for Californians. CCPA is similar to, but different from, Europe’s GDPR, and very like requires new implementation work. Our research captures the compliance gap between what IoT makers do today, and what they will need to do in order to comply with CCPA.

### Third-Party Network Traffic Attribution and Cross-Device User Tracking for IoT and Web
Not long after the invention of the cookie, online advertisers realized technical features of the web could facilitate fine-grained observation of user behavior. By the time mobile “apps” debuted there was an extensive industry ready and willing to apply web tracking techniques to a new medium. The purpose of this study is to investigate if tracking techniques from web and mobile are migrating into the IoT space. We will seek to determine what third-parties, if any, are capable of tracking users across web, mobile, and IoT, and what policies, if any, regulate the collection and processing of IoT data.

### Privacy-preserving Inference and Decision-Making with IoT Data 
In the age of Internet-of-things (IoT) and edge computing, various data-collection mechanisms are constantly collecting rich data about the environment. While these data are an essential component of smart decision-making and inference, they can reveal sensitive information about individuals and violate their privacy. Commercial adoption of data analytics systems will be constrained by these privacy issues, in both regulatory domain (e.g., the EU General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) and from the users' trust perspective. This project aims to enable statistical inference and learning systems without compromising individual privacy. To achieve this goal we will pursue: i) the design of data-collection mechanisms that protect individual privacy, while still providing useful information about the system as a whole; ii) provably optimal techniques to combine information collected from heterogeneous sources; iii) algorithms to sequentially obtain measurements in order to minimize the cost of data collection.

### Privacy Preserving Data Analytics using Secure Multi-Party Computation
IoT devices collect a significant amount of data and this is expected to go up even further. There is a need to develop data analytics techniques which can respect the privacy constraints. In this project, we will investigate privacy preserving data analytics by using the cryptographic technique of secure multi-party computation (MPC).

##  Autonomous Healing
### Flipping the Cloud: Managing and Protecting IoT Interactions among Mutually Distrusting Stakeholders at the Network Edge
The future of IoT software will involve complicated interactions among multiple stakeholders, including software developers, hardware manufacturers, infrastructure providers, network operators, users, and regulators, many of which involve user data. However, according to many current and future visions, users have very little control over the data they create. This project focus on how to change this by allowing users to directly influence or even control the data that relates to them, including data ownership, privacy, and sharing; at the same time, our approach can maintain value provided to other stakeholders. Our approach builds on core technologies of edge computing, hardware security, and regulation of information.

### IoTHub for Managing and Securing Devices in the Home
We are building an IoTHub that will make it easy for everyday consumers to manage and secure IoT devices in the context of homes. Think of this hub like a smart WiFi router for IoT devices, which also offers services and functionality to help with managing and securing IoT devices, especially low-end devices that have minimal computational and networking capabilities.

  * Jason Hong, Professor (HCII)


### Do-It-Yourself-Locally: An IoT Architecture for Localized Data Control for Privacy and Security
Most IoT devices these days come vertically integrated with the manufacturers proprietary backend services, raising serious privacy concerns since users have to cede complete control over their sensitive data and implicitly trust the manufacturer without much transparency on how their data will be used. To protect users’ privacy without compromising the functionality of the current IoT ecosystems, we propose a new clean-slate IoT architecture -- DIYL -- that safely extends a local IoT hub’s data control to generic cloud platforms. In DIYL, IoT apps execute either locally or are securely offloaded to a DIYL supported generic cloud platform (e.g. Amazon AWS) using primitives that provide secure execution and data privacy, completely in the user's control.
