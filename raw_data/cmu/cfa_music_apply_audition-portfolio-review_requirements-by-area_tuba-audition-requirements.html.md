# Tuba Application Requirements
Pre-screening recording and submission instructions for all tuba applicants
Applicants will submit a video recording of their audition material for pre-screening by December 1. Audition and pre-screening requirements are the same. Applicants who pass pre-screening will be notified of their invitation to audition by January 10. The audition schedule can be found here.
Each selection may be recorded separately (including individual movements of solo selections, and excerpts). Adjustments to EQ and reverb are allowed, but there may not be any additional editing or splicing within each selection. Audio may be recorded separately, and synced with video.   
  
Create a separate file for each selection, and label each clearly with the last name of the applicant and the name of the selection.
Applicants are encouraged to use the best recording equipment available to them, and to carefully select the best microphone placement and recording level to reduce distortion. Devices such as a Zoom Handy Recorder will yield good results, and if using a phone, laptop, or tablet, an external USB microphone or microphone attachment can greatly improve the audio. If you do not own or have access to a quality recording device, consider checking with a local or school library, band director, or teacher about borrowing one. Experiment with the recording process in advance, so that your recordings represent you as well as possible.
