## 3. What are my chances of being admitted?
The Graduate Admissions Staff (who answer e-mail messages and phone calls) do not determine admissions criteria and are not involved in admissions decisions. Your chances of being admitted cannot be determined prior to the Graduate Admissions Committee reviewing your completed application package. (For more information on the review process, please see the response below to "Have I been admitted?")
Note: Faculty likewise cannot comment on an applicant's chances. For this reason, we ask that you do not contact faculty directly regarding your admission status.
The admissions committee evaluates all aspects of a completed application and one aspect is not a determining factor in the admissions decision. They do not set a hard cut-off for undergraduate grades although a 3.0 is preferred. Decisions are made by the admissions committee based on looking at the application in its entirety and especially considering overall GPA, as well as, courses taken and grades in senior-level technical classes, TOEFL scores, resume, three letters of recommendation (at least one from faculty), and your responses to three short essay questions.
## 4. Is there rolling admission?
No, there are only two terms of admission- Fall and Spring. There is no priority given to applicants who submit their applications "early". T
For more details on the review process, see [FAQ #18 "Have I been admitted? (What is the status of my application?)"](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/apply/submitting-an-estp-application-faq.html#application18)
## 5. What are the TOEFL, IELTS, DET school/department codes?
The correct school/department codes for EST&P are listed here. If these codes are not available in the ETS pull-down menu, please select the codes for the CMU Materials Science and Engineering department and notify the EST&P program office of this situation.
TOEFL code: 2074
IELTS scores can be sent electronically to:  
Carnegie Mellon University College of Engineering  
431 Hamerschlag Drive  
Ansys Hall Suite 250  
Pittsburgh, PA 15213  
---Email energy@andrew.cmu with your TRF No.**  
---** Do not have paper IELTS scores mailed**  
**
DuoLingo English Test (DET) scores should be sent to: Carnegie Mellon University – College of Engineering
NOTE: 
## 6. What are the essay questions and where can I find these?
We ask applicants to answer three short answer essay questions which are located within the Essay page of the EST&P application. These questions revolve around your interest and passion for energy, goals here at CMU, and goals after graduation. 
## 7. Where do I send my supporting documents such as official transcript?
Official transcripts are not required for the admission process unless you are admitted to and enroll in the program. Unofficial transcripts are sufficient for the application review process and should be uploaded to your online application. Recommender information should be entered in your online application and recommenders should submit their recommendation letters through the online application system. Our address is:
Energy Science, Technology and Policy, Scott Hall 5103  
Carnegie Mellon University  
5000 Forbes Ave.  
Pittsburgh PA 15213
Please refrain from mailing hard copies of supporting documents and other documents such as publications or certificates (besides test scores/transcript). These items will not be filed with your application and will not be held by the program.
## 8. Is it OK if my supporting documents arrive after the application deadline?
Yes, it is acceptable for your letters of recommendation and official score reports to arrive after the application deadline. Receipt of these reports a week or two after the deadline will not affect your chances of being admitted.
Letters of Recommendation do not need to be received prior to your application being submitted.
## 9. Do I need to convert my GPA to a 4.0 scale?
Yes, the admissions committee prefers that you use the free WES GPA calculator to convert your GPA to a 4.0 scale. The alternative is to convert your GPA into a percentage of the maximum possible score used at your institution; then calculate the equivalent number out of the maximum possible 4.0 scale that represents this same percentage. If you believe proportional conversion does not fairly represent your undergraduate GPA, you may offer an explanation in your application’s optional essay question. The admissions committee is displeased when during transcript review they discover an applicant has entered an arbitrary and inflated number as their equivalent GPA out of 4.0

## 10. What is an official letter of financial support and when is it needed?
An official letter of financial support is an original letter (or bank statement) indicating that you are receiving financial support from an outside agency (parents, company, fellowship, etc.). 
This official letter is needed for international students at the time of admission and I-20 processing, but is NOT required by the admissions committee at the time of application.
## 11. May I ask my recommenders to mail in paper letters of recommendation instead of giving instructions for uploading the letter online? And is there a special recommendation form template?
Your application will be processed more efficiently if you request the provider to submit the letter of recommendation online. Paper letters that are mailed in are acceptable but this may delay the processing of your application material. Letters must come directly from the recommender. EST&P does not provide a standardized recommendation form letter. 
## 12. What are the preferred and minimum TOEFL/IELTS/DET scores required for admission?
Non-Native English speakers must submit TOEFL, IELTS, or DuoLingo English Test (DET) scores.  
NOTE: 
Minimum  
Note: CMU and EST&P do not accept computer-based TOEFL scores.

NOTE:
## 13. When checking my application status online, it states that my GRE and TOEFL scores have not yet been received. Why?
In most cases, this means that we have not yet received your official score reports directly from ETS/DuoLingo. If you have already requested ETS/DuoLingo to send your official scores, you need not take any further action. TOEFL scores do not come directly to the department since TOEFL scores are required for both undergraduate and graduate students. Instead, they come to the university's Enrollment Service office and then are sent out to the departments.
It is acceptable for your official score reports to arrive after the application deadline as long as it is during the committee review process. Having your reports arrive after the deadline will not affect your chances of being admitted. 
## 14. What is the status of my application and has it been received?
You can track your application status online. This site is updated when material is received and decisions are made, so please feel free to check your status frequently during the peak admission season and after the deadline. 
## 15. I'm a CMU undergrad/alumni, are there special application considerations or an IMB degree option? 
Yes, we will expedite admission for CMU undergraduates/alumni. EST&P does not offer a BS degree so we cannot offer you a formal Integrated Master's/Bachelor's (IMB) degree option.
Interested CMU undergraduates are encouraged to make and appointment and meet with an EST&P advisor for more details on expediting the application process.
## 16. Is financial aid available for EST&P students?
EST&P is a coursework based professional master's program and students are primarily self-funded through personal savings and educational loans, or externally funded through government or private fellowships or by their employer.The Graduate Admissions Staff do not determine financial aid criteria and are not involved in financial aid decisions.Masters students are encouraged to apply for external funding.
All applicants to the EST&P program are considered for an alumni scholarship by the admissions committee at the time of admission review, which is the only minimal

Fellowships**  
**Students who are interested in applying for external fellowships should see their advisor or check the on-line information provided by the[Office of Scholarships and Fellowships Web site](http://www.cmu.edu/frac/). The website is an excellent resource for locating an abundance of information regarding available funding for students.
### External Funding Opportunities Outside Carnegie Mellon
U.S. Department of Education Resources[Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ "FAFSA Website")online to apply for federal financial aid. Students may obtain information regarding their loans through the[William D. Ford Direct Loan Program](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/loans "William D. Ford Direct Loan Program"), including deferment forms and payment information. Information about the federal student aid programs may be found at [www.studentaid.ed.gov](http://www.studentaid.ed.gov/ "Federal Student Aid").
Grad PLUS[Federal Graduate PLUS Loan](https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchPLUS.action?plusType=gradPlus "Grad Plus Loan website"). This loan allows you, not your parents, to borrow up to the cost of attendance less any other financial aid you receive. You must be a US citizen or permanent resident to qualify. Credit checks are also required to determine eligibility, but the credit criteria are much less stringent than for most private alternative loans. If you don’t meet the credit criteria you may still obtain the loan with an “endorser” who does meet the credit requirements. PLUS applicants cannot have adverse credit based on a review of at least one credit report from a national credit reporting agency.
Private Student Loans:  
Students may have the option to borrow funds through a private lender. These loans are credit based, so applicants may need a cosigner. International students may utilize private lenders if they have a US citizen or permanent resident as a cosigner. Very limited lender options are available for international students without a US citizen/permanent resident co-signer.
[FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200) is a loan comparison service offered free-of-charge to schools by the Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation. Private loan options are available for both students and parents.
