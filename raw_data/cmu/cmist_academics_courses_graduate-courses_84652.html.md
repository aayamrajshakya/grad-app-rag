# Representation and Voting Rights
## Course Number: 84-652 
What does it mean to be represented in a democracy? Who has a voice, and who is left out? This course explores political representation—both as an ideal and as a lived reality. We’ll examine the design of American democratic institutions, the impact of the Voting Rights Act, and the ongoing role of courts in shaping who gets represented. A central theme will be how race and racial attitudes continue to shape political power and outcomes. Along the way, we’ll ask hard questions: Does representation translate into policies that reflect public preferences? How fair are the systems we use to draw voting districts? And what are the consequences of unequal representation for the health of American democracy?
