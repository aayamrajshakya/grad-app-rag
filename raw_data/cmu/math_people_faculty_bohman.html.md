#  Research 
My field of research is extremal and probabilistic combinatorics, and I work on discrete mathematical problems inspired by a diverse collection of perspectives. These include mathematical disciplines as well as information theory (which has a very strong connection with extremal set theory), statistical physics and theoretical computer science. Recently, I have been interested in the Shannon capacities of odd cycles, 'guided' versions of the standard random graph model, randomized network algorithms, list-coloring problems for graphs, and hypergraph discrepancy.
