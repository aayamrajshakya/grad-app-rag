# MS in Artificial Intelligence Engineering
The is a three-semester (97-unit) program that offers students the opportunity to gain state-of-the-art artificial intelligence knowledge from an engineering perspective. Today, AI is driving significant innovation across products, services, and systems in every industry, and tomorrow’s AI engineers will have the advantage.
ECE students within the program will learn how to design and build AI-orchestrated systems capable of operating within engineering constraints. At Carnegie Mellon, we are leading this transformation by teaching students how to simultaneously design a system’s functionality and supporting AI mechanisms, including both its AI algorithms and the platform on which the AI runs, to produce systems that are more adaptable, resilient, and trustworthy.
Students pursuing the MS in AIE will be able to:
  * Demonstrate knowledge of artificial intelligence methods, systems, tool chains, and cross-cutting issues, including security, privacy, and other ethical, societal, and policy challenges
  * Apply ECE concepts and tools to enable AI systems and produce AI tools
  * Be informed practitioners of AI methods to solve ECE and related problems, applying ECE domain knowledge whenever possible to enhance AI effectiveness
  * Understand the limits of AI systems and apply these techniques within these limits
  * Evaluate trade-offs involving technical capabilities and limitations, policy, and ethics in artificial intelligent systems
