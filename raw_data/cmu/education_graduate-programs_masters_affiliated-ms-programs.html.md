## Dual degree with Master of Engineering & Technology Innovation Management
[Engineering and Technology Innovation Management MS ](https://engineering-innovation-management.cmu.edu/)(E&TIM) educates future engineering leaders by coupling technical education with frameworks to foster, manage, and lead technical innovation. A summer internship is an integral element of this interdisciplinary program.
The Mechanical Engineering M.S. degree option may be combined with the E&TIM program to form a 21-month dual degree M.S. program that equips students to drive value creation from technical innovation based on their understanding of technical concepts, innovation management fundamentals, and real world implications.
## Master of Science in Computational Design and Manufacturing
_The department will no longer be admitting and enrolling new students to the MS in Computational Design & Manufacturing after Spring 2025. Students already admitted and enrolled in the MS in Computational Design & Manufacturing degree during or before Spring 2025 will remain eligible to complete their degree requirements through Spring 2026. Students interested in this program are encouraged to apply to one of our other Master of Science degrees. _
This innovative program is intended for students who have a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering and desire to advance their careers by acquiring problem-solving skills with modern computational engineering tools such as computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM).
Students will sharpen their skills by learning the theories and applications of computational design and manufacturing methods through a balance of course and project work.
The project work provides students with practical problem-solving experiences through the use of commercial computational tools or the development of their own custom software.
Requirements are: one Engineering Computation course, four additional technical elective courses, and three courses worth of work on a computational engineering project.
Assistance with course selection and project management is provided by the director of the M.S. in Computational Design and Manufacturing program.
## Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services
The Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services (MII-PS) degree combines engineering, design, and business skills to create products that meet users’ or stakeholders’ value expectations.
The degree is offered by the [Integrated Innovation Institute](http://www.cmu.edu/integrated-innovation/index.html), which is a joint program of the Carnegie Institute Technology (CIT), the College of Fine Arts (CFA), and the Tepper School of Business. The program takes one year (two semesters) to complete and is self-supported.
The MII-PS program focuses on an interdisciplinary approach to developing products.
The MII-PS is designed for students with a bachelor’s degree in engineering, industrial design, or related fields with a strong interest in product development.
Visit the [Master of Integrated Innovation for Products & Services](https://www.cmu.edu/iii/degrees/miips/index.html) website for more information.
## Master of Energy Science, Technology and Policy
Effective solutions to energy problems will come from engineers and technical managers who understand the interdisciplinary challenges of energy and who are well informed on the broad issues of energy supply, demand, storage, utilization, policy, sustainability, and the environment.
The Carnegie Mellon [Energy Science, Technology and Policy (ESTP) program](http://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/) addresses this need with a professional engineering master’s degree that is based in engineering, aligned with new discoveries in science, attuned to sustainability and the environment, and informed by a broader perspective in economics and public policy.
Depth in the ESTP curriculum is associated with declaring a concentration and taking specialized coursework in one of six engineering disciplines, which include Mechanical Engineering.
Students must apply and be admitted directly to the College of Engineering ESTP program. Applications are submitted through the program's website.
