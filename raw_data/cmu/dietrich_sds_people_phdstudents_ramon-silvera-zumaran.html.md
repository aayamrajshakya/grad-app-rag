## Bio
I am interested in the use of behavioral interventions to promote healthy behaviors. Broadly, my hope is to contribute to understanding and leveraging why, when, and where these interventions can be most impactful, don’t work, and everything in between. Specifically, I am interested in doing so by (1) studying the influence of contextual factors such as social and cultural norms on the heterogeneity of effects of behavioral interventions, (2) testing the generalizability of behavioral interventions through experiments outside White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic (WEIRD) samples, and (3) leveraging psychological mechanisms to improve the well-being of others through sustained behavior change.
