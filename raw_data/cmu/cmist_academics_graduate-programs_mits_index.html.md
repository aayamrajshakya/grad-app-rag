## The digital world moves fast. You need to be faster. 
The Master of Information Technology Strategy is a cooperative endeavor administered by the [Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/index.html) and in partnership with the[College of Engineering](http://www.cit.cmu.edu/) and the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/). This program creates leaders in the IT strategy space by allowing you to tailor your degree to an area of interest and teaching you how the puzzle pieces fit together—both of which make you valuable to employers. The average starting salary for MITS graduates is nearly $120,000.
The program's two tracks provide flexibility, but their brevity—the longer of the two takes sixteen months to complete—is well-suited for those who want to quickly advance their professional career. Both tracks involve a required Capstone Project, in which teams of four to six students partner with a company, research center, or organization to help them solve a strategic problem. 
The program offers four areas of specialization: Data Analytics, Information Security, Technology Strategy & Governance, and Software and Networked Systems. No matter what you choose, you'll receive a blend of the other three, meaning you will leave Carnegie Mellon with a well-rounded skillset that makes you an attractive target on the job market. MITS is a STEM-designated degree according to the US Department of Homeland Security, meaning international students may apply for a longer period of Optional Practical Training. 
Graduates go on to careers as data scientists, software engineers, military cyber operations officers, artificial intelligence and machine learning engineers, and business technology analysts for companies such as Oracle, Microsoft, Barclays, Deloitte, Apple, Google, DoorDash, and Visa.

## Elective (12 Units)
## Elective (12 units)
An elective is a course taken in addition to the core, capstone project, pre-requisite and required courses, is in an area of interest to the student, and is applicable to their degree. The most common choice is to select outside of the student’s declared concentration, from the pre-approved list of [concentration courses](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/academics/graduate-programs/mits/index.html#concentrations). MITS students should plan to select technical courses, although some exceptions to this rule will be considered. 
All MITS students are required to take a minimum of 12 units of elective coursework. Units associated with elective courses vary. All students are advised to discuss their choice of electives with the graduate program manager and receive approval before enrolling. If a student wishes to take an elective outside of the pre-approved courses, only those electives that have been approved by the academic adviser will be accepted towards degree completion requirements.
## Policy Seminar (6 units)
Policy Seminar: 84-791 and 84-792
Each semester, the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy and Technology (CMIST) hosts several lectures and speaker series that address topics spanning the intersection of security and technology, international relations, political science, and more. We bring senior leaders to the CMU community who are experts in these fields and have made remarkable contributions to these and other fields. CMIST graduate students will enroll in the three-unit Policy Seminar each semester and be expected to participate in and reflect on their interactions throughout the CMIST-hosted lectures and roundtable discussions. The Policy Seminar courses are only open to CMIST graduate students.
  * [84-791](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/academics/courses/graduate-courses/84791.html) Policy Seminar I (3 units)
  * [84-792](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/academics/courses/graduate-courses/84792.html) Policy Seminar II (3 units)

# Past Projects
#### OGE: AI-Powered Operational Gaming for Strategic Decision-Making
By using artificial intelligence to create a dynamic decision-making environment, the continued development of the Operational Gaming Engine (OGE) aims to help decision-makers navigate complex situations more effectively.
The MITS student team tested an AI-powered gaming simulator within the OGE platform and improved the user experience and user interface. The students also wrote supporting documentation, including a “Quick Start Guide for Instructors” designed to help faculty members streamline lesson preparation.

#### Rethinking National Power: Comparing Global Dynamics Through Industry Data
_Top Capstone Award Recipient - CMIST Commencement 2025_
Current models for assessing national power largely do not account for nuanced economic indicators beyond basic metrics like steel production.
To improve on these limitations, the MITS student team built a neural network-based model that analyzes industry-specific data–such as workforce size, worker activities, products, assets, and capital-labor ratios–to assess the feasibility of one industry pivoting to support another. 
_Team members: Jacob Lapin, Phillip “PJ” Roach, Jr., and Jonah Nascimento_

#### D.A.R.E. Capstone
The D.A.R.E. Capstone project explores the use of large-language models (LLMs), such as GPT, to transform educational and simulation-based learning experiences through two key applications: Socratic Books and the Operational Gaming Environment (OGE). 
Applying their software development and generative AI expertise, the MITS student team developed the user interface and created live web app demos and gameplay walkthroughs in order to help facilitate interactive learning in the classroom.

#### TopoMojo Capstone Project
Managing virtual machine (VM) clusters used in academic and training environments traditionally involves repetitive, manual SSH connections and command-line interactions–resulting in inefficiency, limitations of scalability, and security concerns.
To address this challenge, the MITS student team designed and implemented APIs to automate VM command executive and retrieve command outputs, thereby improving consistency while reducing the manual workload.

#### BEND Framework: Understanding Emotional Imagery Online
Information operations from corporate branding and marketing to political influence campaigns require generating and interpreting messages. Often these messages are text and increasingly involve audio or visual information such as sound snippets, images, and videos. Currently there exist sound solutions for interpreting text-based messages, such as the BEND framework, as well as solutions for interpreting emoji and emoticons. However, audio and image solutions lag behind. 
In this project, students have extracted emotions from multimodal information online to understand public opinion and sentiment toward political figures, policies, or events across different platforms. They were successfully able to tailor communication strategies for political campaigns across text, images, and audio for better resonance, as well as targeting detection of misinformation in political campaigns on social media platforms geared toward younger audiences.

#### Security Chaos Engineering
Large-scale distributed systems have unpredictable and complex outcomes that are costly when incidents occur. Our systems are becoming more and more distributed, ephemeral, and immutable in how they function in today’s ever-evolving landscape of contemporary engineering practices. Not only are we becoming more complex but the rate of velocity in which our systems are interacting and evolving is making the work more challenging for us humans. In this shifted paradigm, it is becoming problematic to comprehend the operational state, health, and safety of our systems. 
To address this, the MITS student team intentionally introduced chaos to test system resilience and stress response. In doing so, the team gained insights into best practices for security configurations, identified security vulnerabilities, and acknowledged the imperative for ongoing improvements in AWS security practices.

#### Security Assessment for IoT Devices
The rise in the Internet of Things (IoT) usage broadens the landscape for potential cyber threats. Security methods to ensure privacy have not kept up with the increase in IoT devices in the marketplace, including those used in customers’ home environments. 
To address this challenge, MITS team members conducted a risk assessment and identified the largest security threats to IoT devices commonly found in office spaces and smart homes. They then analyzed four security programs in order to recommend the best alternative for those IoT devices.

#### Object Detection for Autonomous Vehicles
Autonomous driving vehicles rely heavily on predefined labels of objects to assist in their capacity to travel safely. However, these labels are incomplete because traditional object detection models do not account for objects that are not recognized. 
To address this gap, MITS team members developed a system that detects all objects, known and unknown, from images and videos captured by autonomous driving vehicles. They reviewed these images, verified each known object, and labeled all unrecognized objects. The finished system filtered out known objects and noise and clustered unknown objects together, thereby reducing the need to manually label each object.

# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
## Q: What are the benefits of sponsoring a MITS Capstone project? 
A: Sponsoring companies benefit by receiving the most innovative solution ideas to designated problems based on our students’ curricular experiences with top trained and prestigious professionals in computer science, software engineering, and political science. Sponsors also receive firsthand experience with soon-to-be-graduates who could be prime candidates for filling future employment needs. Past sponsors have also historically leveraged the Capstone project as a way to develop connections to students and faculty for future collaborations with Carnegie Mellon University.
## Q: What does it mean to “sponsor” a project?
A: Project sponsorships are an important culminating aspect of our professional master’s MITS program. When asked to sponsor a proposed project, an organization is invited to give a philanthropic gift in support of CMIST and the MITS scholarship fund. While this gift donation is not required to get a proposed project approved, it does go a long way toward helping sustain the exceptional academic experience of our graduate students. 
For each approved project, our highly-trained students are tasked with exploring innovative technology solutions for a given strategic problem or set of problems that the organization has identified. Student groups work for 14 weeks to synthesize and test workable solutions for an organization’s specific needs. Some examples of projects might include helping to improve their efficiency, internal work-flow processes, cybersecurity responses, and overall use of technology by organizational stakeholders. 
## Q: What responsibilities come along with sponsoring a MITS capstone project? 
A: One person will act as a technical point-of-contact at your organization. This person will spend approximately 1-2 hours per week to meet with the student team. This individual will help to develop the scope of the project and give real-time feedback to student groups as they work through different solution ideas. There is an additional commitment expectation that representatives from the sponsoring company attend the final project presentations at the end of the semester. 
## Q: What happens to any IP created for the MITS capstone project? 
A: Carnegie Mellon University prides itself on prioritizing entrepreneurship for their students and as a result, student groups will own any IP that is created as a result of their project. Many students have negotiated the sale of IPs with sponsoring companies after the project is completed and these rates have historically been hyper-competitive compared to their assumed market value. 
## Q: What kind of organizations are eligible to propose a project? 
A: The constant need to evolve technologies as the market demands creates the perfect opportunity for our students to learn experientially. For this reason, any organization that utilizes technology in any internal or external capacity can be a perfect fit for this project. Our past projects have ranged from research-intensive projects to the testing, creation, or implementation of new software within an organization. A strong project proposal encompasses potential work that spans at least one of our MITS concentrations (Data Analytics, Software and Networked Systems, Information Security, or Technology Strategy & Governance) but many past projects have required a wide range of these concentrations to arrive at the best solution recommendations.
