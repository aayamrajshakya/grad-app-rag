# Robotics
Our experts are creating the next generation of robotics for human interaction across disciplines.
## Robotics
* ### Bioinspired robotics
Natural organisms have amazing abilities that inspire the field of robotics. Our researchers are investigating how we can replicate a leafhopper’s jump in a robot, what we can learn from the way cockroaches move, and how we can create robots and biohybrid robotic systems that are as robust and adaptable as animals.
Faculty involved: [Sarah Bergbreiter](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/bergbreiter-sarah.html), [Aaron Johnson](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/johnson-aaron.html), [Victoria Webster-Wood](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/webster-wood-victoria.html), [Inseung Kang](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/kang-inseung.html), [Ophelia Bolmin](https://engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/bolmin-ophelia.html)
* ### Robots that walk, run, jump, creep, roll, and fly
Researchers explore legged robotics to design better controllers for stable, energy efficiency, fast locomotion as well as the ability to reliably travel over unstructured terrain - like the moon.
Our faculty are creating technologies for infrastructure inspection, aerial load transportation, agricultural monitoring, and autonomous point-to-point flight.

* ### Micro robotics and biomedical applications
Through multidisciplinary collaboration, our faculty are fabricating magnetic micro swimming robots assembled from DNA nanostructures, controlling robots that walk on water and climb walls with nano-fiber adhesives, and designing devices for microsurgery.

* ### Assistive robotics and wearables
Wearable robotic systems can have a transformative impact on human mobility. Our researchers are developing robotic exoskeletons for clinical populations and building portable systems for precision rehab. By combining data from wearable sensors with artificial intelligence they are trying to understand what movement patterns are associated with disease progression. 
Faculty involved: Eni Halilaj, Inseung Kang

* ### Special tasks: Human help
Whether it's maneuvering through debris after a hurricane, or helping a person with physical limitations chop vegetables, robots can perform tasks that are difficult and dangerous for people.
