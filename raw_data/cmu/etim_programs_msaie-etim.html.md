## Internship - 3 units (19-695)
The internship is the “ultimate elective” for the ETIM program.
Ideally, it will provide you with the opportunity to apply what you are learning in the program in a real-world situation.
Through an internship, you will learn things about yourself, how you work with different stakeholders in a new organization, how that organization measures your success, as well as the technical specifics of whatever role you have in the organization.
While you will be responsible for securing your own internship, you’ll receive guidance from the ETIM Executive Director and your Program Career Advisor.
We have extensive relationships with world-class innovation companies and will assist you in getting an internship that aligns with your interests and talents.
