## Program types
### Full-time professional MS
This one-year, full-time professional MS is the standard degree offered by the ETIM program for future innovation management leaders.
  * One-year accelerated learning program
  * January – December
  * Pittsburgh main campus
  * Summer internship required
  * Apply by January 15 for March notification

### Full-time dual ETIM MS + Engineering MS
This two-year dual degree option helps students to further hone their engineering acuity and develop into innovation management leaders.
  * Flexible two-year program integrated with one of the following College of Engineering MS programs: Biomedical, Chemical, Civil & Environmental, Electrical & Computer, Material Science, or Mechanical Engineering.
  * Create one application for both the ETIM program and the College of Engineering program you’re interested in pursuing. The ETIM program admissions committee makes ETIM application decisions independent of other College of Engineering programs application decisions.
  * Dual Degree students typically start in the Fall with their School of Engineering program. Then they complete a year with ETIM and return the following Spring to their traditional engineering program.
  * Some Dual Degree departments allow for a Spring start. In this case, 2-year program attendance is completed consecutively. Spring start students and students who defer for only a semester in our dual-degree program, and start in January during the spring semester, will spend the first year with ETIM, and then follow with the traditional engineering program in the second year. This is a condition of the Office of International Education to allow international students CPT authorization for their first summer.
  * Apply by the earlier deadlines of individual School of Engineering departments (please reference the other department websites.)
