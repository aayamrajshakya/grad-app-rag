# Hiring Student Workers
There has been significant focus over the past few years on implementing best practices for hourly student hiring. New requirements provide guidance for hiring departments, transparency to students, and support of Federal Work-Study employer requirements. Please view the Student Employment Resources section of the [CMUWorks Service Center](https://www.cmu.edu/cmuworks/business-partners/index.html) website to find materials, or select the links to the right on this webpage. Additional student hiring information, including required pay rate validation examples, can be found on the [Career and Professional Development Center](http://www.cmu.edu/career/faculty_and_staff/on-campus_employment_for_staff/index.html) website.
The academic year period for student employment is August 14, 2023, to May 5, 2024.The ending date of May 5, 2023, should be used for all student academic year appointments.
  * New academic year appointments must be entered for all returning students, and new pay rate validation support for each student position must be uploaded in Workday.
  * Be sure that you have ended all student summer appointments on or before the new academic year start date for each appointment.


There are three types of hourly student employment options available:
  * Federal Work-Study (FWS):
  * Federal Community Service Work-Study (FCS):
  * Non-Work-Study (NWS):
