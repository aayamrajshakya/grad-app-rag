In order for security and privacy tools to work, they must be easily and intuitively usable—by everyone. With research spanning from developing tools that enable users to create strong and memorable passwords to automatically summarizing long, verbose privacy policies into readable, digestible chunks, Carnegie Mellon University CyLab researchers are focusing on ways to make security and privacy not feel like a hard task for users, but an easy, enjoyable experience.
