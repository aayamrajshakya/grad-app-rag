# MAM Accelerated Master's Programs
* * *
Done faster. Change sooner.
Students with the drive to develop as leaders and enter the job market more quickly can earn their undergraduate and MAM degrees together in five years instead of the typical six.
An accelerated program isn’t just a savings of time. It’s also a considerable savings in cost, and for undergrads coming from outside of Pittsburgh, it offers an expedited path to experience the benefits of two distinct educational and cultural environments.
The Heinz College MAM program has collaborative agreements in place with the following institutions:
Carnegie Mellon University  
3 years CMU undergraduate (any major) / 1 year integrated / 1 year at Heinz College
Allegheny College  
3 years at Allegheny / 2 years at Heinz College
Bethany College  
3 years at Bethany / 2 years at Heinz College
Chatham University  
3 years at Chatham / 1 year integrated / 1 year at Heinz College
