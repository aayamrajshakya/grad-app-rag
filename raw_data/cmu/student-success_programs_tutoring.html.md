## Drop-in Tutoring
Drop-in tutoring targets our highest demand courses through regularly scheduled open tutoring sessions during the fall and spring semesters. You are not required to commit to regular attendance and you can come as needed throughout the semester. You can utilize drop-in tutoring to discuss course related content, clarify and ask questions, work through practice problems, and stay and do work.
