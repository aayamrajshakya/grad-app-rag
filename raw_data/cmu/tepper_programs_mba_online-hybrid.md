## Earn Your MBA on Your Time
The Tepper School of Business offers an Online Hybrid MBA program, designed for working professionals who want the flexibility of online learning with the benefits of in-person immersion. You will earn the same MBA degree as students in the Full-Time MBA program, taught by the same faculty who are recognized worldwide for their research and teaching.
## How Does the Online Hybrid MBA Work?
Our Online Hybrid MBA delivers the full Tepper School MBA experience in a flexible format that works with your schedule.
  * Count on the [same challenging and rewarding core coursework](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/curriculum) taught by our professors who lead the Tepper School’s Full-Time MBA program — just in a different format.  

  * Join live, interactive online classes two evenings a week and complete additional coursework on your own time.  

  * Graduate with our [STEM-designated MBA](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/curriculum) — the same degree as the full-time format — ready to lead at the speed of change.  

  * Enjoy all the benefits of a Tepper School MBA, from personalized leadership coaching and [career services](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/careers) to a powerful international alumni community that’s always there for you.


No matter how you pace your studies, you get the full Tepper School experience.
### Access Weekends
Access Weekends are a signature feature of the Tepper School Online Hybrid MBA, bringing students together for in-person learning and networking. These weekends complement weekly live online classes and group projects by offering the chance to connect face-to-face with faculty, peers, and industry leaders.
There are three types of Access Weekends:
  * Academic Access Weekends (in Pittsburgh): Tied to core courses, these weekends include faculty-led sessions, career coaching, and professional development workshops such as Developing Executive Presence and Inclusive Leadership. Attendance at the first four Academic Access Weekends, including [BaseCamp](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/curriculum/basecamp-orientation), is expected.  

  * Experiential Access Weekends (Pittsburgh): Optional in the second and third year, these weekends feature case competitions, hackathons, and collaborative CMU programming that help you practice skills in high-energy, real-world settings.  

  * Travel Access Weekend (U.S. city): Once during the program, your cohort will travel together to a major U.S. city outside Pittsburgh. You’ll engage in corporate site visits, alumni panels, and cultural experiences that broaden your industry exposure and professional network.


Through Access Weekends, Online Hybrid MBA students gain the same sense of community, hands-on learning, and career development as those in the Full-Time MBA, while balancing professional and personal commitments.
### Build Lifelong Connections
A strong, supportive community is a hallmark of the Tepper MBA experience.
In every part of your MBA experience, you'll tackle team-based projects, soak up diverse perspectives, and strengthen bonds with faculty and fellow students that will continue throughout your career.
You’ll complement your online coursework with in-person Access Weekends — immersive opportunities to forge close ties with your cohort and professors and participate in professional development activities.
All admitted MBA students, full-time and part-time, participate in [BaseCamp Orientation](https://www.cmu.edu/tepper/programs/mba/curriculum/basecamp-orientation), which is not your typical new-student orientation. MBA students can also take part in MBA Global Treks, explore [Pittsburgh’s cultural richness and greenery](https://www.cmu.edu/campus-life/living-in-pittsburgh), or join [MBA student clubs](https://tartanconnect.cmu.edu/club_signup?group_type=9335089&category_tags=).
