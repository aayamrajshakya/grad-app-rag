## Bio
I have always been inclined to communicate and see the world through numbers. Numbers brought me both comfort and excitement when I found verbal language to be inadequate. I wanted math to be a constant presence in my life, so much so that I majored in it in college. After doing a summer internship at JPMorgan, I knew that I wanted to use math in the world of finance.  
  
I returned to JPMorgan as a Full-Time Corporate Analyst. In this role, I provided value to teams across the Commercial & Investment Bank and Asset & Wealth Management lines of business through automation and analytics. I utilized Python, Alteryx, and Tableau to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the teams I served. I also led initiatives that have placed safeguards to ensure that those teams are more appropriately equipped to mitigate future risks.  
  
I plan to pursue a career at a financial institution that will allow me to further explore the opportunities for integrating math with finance. With my educational background, I am confident I possess the intellect and patience required to tackle complex problems. Together with my experience working at a multinational firm, I am certain I will succeed in navigating the corporate world of quantitative finance.  
  
I am happy to set up a meeting, either online or face-to-face, with you to further discuss what I can offer.
