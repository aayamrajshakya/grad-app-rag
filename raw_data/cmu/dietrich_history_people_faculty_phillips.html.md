## Bio
Christopher Phillips's research and teaching focus on the history of science in modern America, particularly statistics and mathematics. Prof. Phillips is currently working on a history of statistics in medicine, centered on a group of biostatisticians at the National Institutes of Health and their efforts to transform measures of causality and proof in medicine. It is, in a sense, the prehistory of our current moment of "risky medicine" and "precision medicine," as well as of algorithms and artificial intelligence in medicine. This project investigates how and why medicine became a science of numbers. Phillips’s first book,The New Math: A Political HistoryScouting and Scoring: How We Know What We Know About Baseball
