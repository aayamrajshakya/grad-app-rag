## Frequently Asked Questions
Is this a summer camp or a conservatory experience?
The School of Drama’s Pre-College Program is not a summer camp. It is an intensive program modeled after our undergraduate BFA curriculum. The program provides a strong basis for the student to decide to pursue further professional theater training. Attendance is mandatory in all classes in order to keep up with the rigors of the programs. Students who fail to attend class and/or to meet program requirements without explicit approval from their program directors may face an academic expulsion.
Why don't I need an audition tape?
Pre-College Drama focuses on preparing students for the audition process rather than the execution of a production. Requirement of a video audition for admittance to Pre-College Drama would undermine the goals of the program.
Will I need to bring monologues or music?
If you have material you are working on or would like to work on, please bring it along, but it is not required.
Will there be a final production?
There is no final production. Our program is focused on process not product.
Will I earn college credit from this program?
No, Pre-College Drama students do not earn college credit.
Where can I get the necessary textbooks?
You will be provided with a small book list to purchase in advance of the program within a month of your arrival.
What are the dance wear requirements?
Students in the Music Theater option are the only ones that will need to bring dancewear. You will be provided with a list of recommended clothing upon acceptance. 
If you have specific questions concerning dance wear, contact Maria Stoy at mstoy@andrew.cmu.edu or 412.268.3284.
Do students in the Acting option have special clothing requirements?
Students in the Acting option only need to bring loose-fitting, comfortable clothing for Movement class. No dancewear is required unless taking Tap for an elective.
Do students in the Design/Production option need any special clothing or tools?
Design/Production students should bring close-toed shoes and a laptop computer. A supply kit will be prepared in advance at the university bookstore for purchase before your arrival. 
Do I need to bring a computer to Pre-College Drama?
Design/Production students are required to bring a laptop able to run Adobe software (provided by the program).
Acting and Music Theater students are required to bring either a laptop or tablet for use in Dramaturgy class. 
Can I take an elective in the School of Music or another department?
No. Due to class times and varying schedules, you cannot take classes outside Pre-College Drama.
I'm a Pre-College student, but not enrolled in Pre-College Drama. Can I take a dance, audition or improv class?
No. Due to the number of students enrolled in Pre-College Drama, we do not have space in our classes to accommodate students from other programs.
