# Materials for information technology
Research in the area of materials for information technology is driven by two primary forces.
  * The need for speed and processing as much information as possible. We are going to create and store more information in 2022 than the total information stored by humanity until 2020. For example, a self-driving car needs to make decisions in a millisecond based on complex input from sensors.
  * The need to limit the energy consumed by sending and processing all of this data. At the current rate, in less than 20 years, all electrical energy produced on Earth will be consumed by IT.
