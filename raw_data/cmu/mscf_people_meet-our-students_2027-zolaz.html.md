## Bio
Fast decisions. Clear thinking. Backed by logic and data. That’s what I value, and it’s what led me to quantitative finance.  
  
I got my Bachelor of Science in 2025 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, majoring in Actuarial Science, Statistics, and Economics, with a minor in Computational Science and Engineering. This blend gave me a strong foundation in data, modeling, and financial thinking.  
  
Through internships in reinsurance, securities, private equity, and asset management, I’ve worked on projects ranging from predictive modeling to market research. These experiences taught me how to adapt quickly, think clearly, and connect technical work to real-world decisions.  
  
Now, as an MSCF student at Carnegie Mellon, I’m looking to keep learning and apply what I’ve gained to a fast-paced team where I can contribute and help drive real impact. Happy to connect and chat more!
