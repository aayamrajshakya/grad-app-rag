## Bio
Graduated from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen with a bachelor's degree in mathematics and applied mathematics, I built a solid foundation in mathematical theories. However, how does a theory generate profits in the market? This question has guided my professional journey in quantitative finance. During my internships at quant funds, I explored how to translate theoretical tools into real-world strategies across different assets in the global market. In my quantitative research on equity and commodity futures, I applied data mining, time series modeling, and machine learning techniques to generate predictive signals. I participated in the full research cycle, from factor mining, signal design, portfolio construction, to strategy execution. Throughout the process, I maintained a strong focus on achieving stable returns in live trading.  
  
I decided to join the MSCF program to sharpen my modeling and coding skills in quantitative finance. With enthusiasm in the dynamic financial markets, I aim to pursue a career in quantitative research upon graduation.
