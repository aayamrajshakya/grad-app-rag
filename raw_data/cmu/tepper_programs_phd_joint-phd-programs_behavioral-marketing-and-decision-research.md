# Behavioral Marketing and Decision Research
This joint Ph.D. program in Behavioral Marketing and Decision Research is a unique opportunity to master two disciplines. The intersection of these two areas, Marketing and Behavioral Decision Research, is at the forefront of work in consumer behavior, psychology, economics and policy. 
Because this is a joint program, the requirements to complete it successfully include requirements from both the Tepper School of Business (Tepper) and the Department of Social and Decision Sciences (SDS). However, because of the overlap in these two disciplines, many of the requirements for each program apply to the other (e.g., one of the two summer research papers required by Tepper will also satisfy the SDS research paper requirement).
Oversight will be handled by the Joint Program Oversight Committee (JPOC). This committee is comprised of the Director of Graduate Studies at SDS, the head of the Tepper Ph.D. Committee, and one faculty liaison between these areas. Most decisions regarding Ph.D. students in this program will be handled by the JPOC. However, it is important to note that students are considered members of both the Tepper School and SDS. This means that decisions regarding Ph.D. education made by those schools separately also apply to students in this joint program. That is, the Graduate Education Committee (GEC) at SDS and the Ph.D. committee at Tepper may make changes to the general requirements for all graduate students in their respective areas. These changes also apply to joint program students.
## Requirements
This program is rather flexible, allowing students to redefine their educational goals as their interests grow and change. The design of this Ph.D. program is based on a full-time commitment, including summers, and on the completion of the activities listed below.
The key requirements for completing the degree are:
  * Course work
  * First-Year and Second-Year Summer Research Paper
  * Qualifying Examinations
  * Dissertation Proposal & Defense


Details on each of these, as well as additional information on degree policies, are below.
### Course Work
Total Number of Units Required for Degree Attainment: Students are required to carry a minimum of 36 units in each semester (Fall, Spring, and Summer) for the duration of their time in the program. Any exceptions to this, because of extenuating circumstances, would have to be approved by the student’s advisor and the JPOC.  
  
Waiver Policy: Since the Tepper School PhD program has no required courses, students have the option of opting out of taking courses in which they feel they have sufficient preparation. Students should consult with their advisors for approval to opt out of a course; it should be noted that students are required to take the full cohort of qualifying exams in Year 2 of the program, whether or not they have taken the Tepper courses that correspond to them.
#### Curriculum Requirement Details
  * The Ph.D. curriculum is a synthesis of course offerings from the Tepper School and from SDS.
  * For Tepper, there is no explicit course requirement, though courses are offered in a variety of disciplines organized around the core disciplines of Economics, Operations Research, and Organization Behavior and Theory, with each of the functional areas of Accounting, Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, and Operations Management being associated with one or more of the core disciplines. Students in the Ph.D. program also take courses in their own area of specialization (i.e., the area in which the student is admitted).
  * For SDS, a minimum of 12 Ph.D. courses (156 units; typically 144 units for 12 unit graduate classes, some graduate classes—e.g., Ph.D. courses from the Psychology Department—are 9 units).
    * At least 4 of the 12 courses must be in methodology. At least 2 of the 4 methodology courses must embody standard statistics methodology.
    * All courses must be at the Ph.D. level. Some courses with Ph.D. numbers may not be acceptable, for example, a basic course in computer programming. Non-standard Ph.D. courses should always be approved by your advisor the JPOC. Masters courses are only acceptable if the instructor verifies to the JPOC, prior to the start of the course, that the Ph.D.-level work and activities will be undertaken by the students.
    * Students may use, at most, one independent study for meeting the coursework (non-methodology) requirements. This independent study must be taken for a letter grade. Students must petition the GEC to use an independent study for this purpose, and include in the petition a comprehensive reading list and statement signed by the faculty member facilitating the independent study indicating that the student's time and effort was comparable to a standard Ph.D.-level course. Independent studies used as "fillers" or for research do not count for coursework requirements. These latter independent studies must be taken pass/fail.
  * SDS Ph.D. Seminars (12 units)
    * Students must attend the main SDS seminars (typically held on Tuesdays, 12:00-1:30pm) during their entire period of residence. Students are also expected to attend one or more of the specialized seminar series sponsored by SDS during their entire period of residence. 


#### Further Details About the Marketing Courses
The general Marketing Ph.D. Program is organized into three tracks: 
(I) Consumer Behavior  
(II) Empirical Modeling  
(III) Analytical Modeling 
Often, two or more tracks are combined. 
For this joint program, students are expected to complete the Consumer Behavior track, but are encouraged to take courses in the other tracks. This is especially true because successful completion of the Marketing Qualifying exam is unlikely without a core understanding of Empirical Modeling and Analytical Modeling.
The courses that students take tend to organize into two categories: Courses for All Marketing Students and Courses Based on Track. One thing to note is that this list is just an example and course offerings change regularly. Make sure to consult your area representative about this. 
Courses for all Marketing students include*: 
  * Analytical Models in Marketing (47-753)
  * Analytical & Structural Marketing Models (47-744)
  * Bayesian Statistics for Marketing (47-747)
  * Multivariate Data Analysis (47-755)
  * Empirical Models in Marketing (47-756)
  * Structural Models & Quantitative Methods (47-757)
  * Estimating Dynamic and Structural Models (47-952)
  * Understanding the Consumer Mind (47-738)
  * Topics in Consumer Behavior (47-739)


*Note that in order to succeed in the marketing qualifying exam, all of these courses are recommended. 
#### Courses Based on Track
Note that students typically do not take all of these courses, but rather select those that best fit their research interests. Course titles and numbers may change and are not always offered, students may wish to substitute similar courses when available. Also, the set of courses for the two modeling tracks are the same because 1) empirical students increasingly formulate theory-based models and 2) theory/analytical students increasingly empirically test and validate their conclusions.

## Qualifying Exams Based on Track
#### Consumer Behavior Track
Students take two sets of qualifying exams: 
  1. Marketing — Students are tested on the breadth of the Marketing area which includes material covered in the "Courses for All Marketing Students," reading list, and seminar topics.
  2. Social and Decision Science Qualifier Exams on Judgement and Choice — Courses indicated with an * prepare you for this exam, but confirm with the SDS Department on schedules and preparations. 


Because the "Behavioral Economics" exam (also known as the "Choice" exam) and the "Psychology of Decision Making" exam (also called the "Judgement" exam) taken by students in the Behavioral Marketing & Decision Research joint program are given outside of the standard early-January timeframe for all Tepper qualifying exams, the following policy is in effect for students in this area of study: 
  * Students will be given a one-monthJune
  * Students will be given a two-monthJuly/August
  * Students taking both exams in the same summer will be given a three-month


This extension structure would also apply in cases where qualifying exams need to be retaken.
