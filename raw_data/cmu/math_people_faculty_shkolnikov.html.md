#  Research 
At the moment, I am studying interacting particle systems arising in mathematical finance, mathematical physics, and neuroscience using tools from stochastic analysis and PDE/SPDE. More broadly, my interests include a variety of topics in probability theory and PDEs: random operators, integrable probability, models of random growth, concentration of measure, large deviations, and probabilistic approaches to PDEs.
