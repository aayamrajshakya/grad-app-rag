## Bio
I am a first-year MSCF student at Carnegie Mellon University, currently exploring internship opportunities for the summer of 2026. My ideal role is in quantitative trading or research at a fast-paced trading or investment firm where I can learn, grow, and contribute to solving the most challenging quantitative problems embedded in financial markets. Previously, I graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Florida with a BS in Data Science, alongside a minor in Economics and a Certificate in AI Fundamentals and Applications. During this time, I also gained valuable experience performing statistical analysis on large data sets as a Data Intern at Floww and in my capstone project with professional analysts from the Tampa Bay Rays. If you think that we may be a mutual fit, please do not hesitate to reach out via email or LinkedIn.
