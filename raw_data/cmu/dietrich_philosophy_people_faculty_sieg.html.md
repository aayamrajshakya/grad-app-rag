## Bio
My research in mathematical logic is broadly concerned with the Foundations of Mathematics and focuses in particular on proof theoretic investigations. It is complemented by work in the History of Modern Logic & Mathematics and in the Philosophy of Mathematics. The historical research has led to participation in editorial projects, which have helped to shed a new and distinctive light on the development of logic in the first half of the 20th century; these projects concern Paul Bernays, David Hilbert and Kurt Gödel.
My teaching includes Freshman Seminars, Intermediate and Advanced Lecture Courses, and Graduate Research Seminars. At its center, is the attempt to impart a deepened understanding of mathematics, its systematic internal organization and its connection to aspects of our intellectual and physical experience. This fascinating interplay of mathematical thought and experience is embedded in rich historical and philosophical contexts, from Euclid and Plato to Hilbert and Kant.
I studied mathematics, physics and logic at universities in Germany (Berlin and Münster). After completing my graduate studies at Stanford University, I taught in the Department of Philosophy at Columbia University. Since 1985, I have been on the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University. I was co-founder of the interdisciplinary program in Pure and Applied Logic that is joint with Computer Science and Mathematics. From 1994 to 2005, I was Head of the Philosophy Department. In 1996, I founded the [Laboratory for Symbolic & Educational Computing](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/research/lsec/index.html) (LSEC) and have been directing it since that time, first with Richard Scheines as co-director and since 2005 with Teddy Seidenfeld as co-director.

Results of mathematical logic do not give us precise answers to large philosophical questions, but they can force us to think through philosophical positions. Broad philosophical 
For these reasons, I have been engaged in editorial projects on the work of three major logicians, Bernays, Gödel and Hilbert. In addition I have been analyzing developments in 19th century mathematics, which resulted in a radical transformation of the subject. Howard Stein called it a transformation "so profound that it is not too much to call it a second birth of the subject." It was effected mainly by the work of Gauss, Dirichlet, Riemann and Dedekind. Hilbert's mathematical foundational work stands in this tradition.

Projects supported by grants  
Various aspects of my work involve extensive cooperation with a great number of colleagues and have received financial support, in particular,  
(i) Editing unpublished work of David Hilbert has been supported by the German National Science Foundation; for editing the correspondence of Kurt Gödel the Sloan Foundation gave support between 1998 and 2002; finally, the National Endowment for the Humanities supported editing and translating the philosophical writings of Paul Bernays, 2000-2003.  
(ii) Work on automated proof search (joint with Cornell University) and the effectiveness of computer-based instruction (with Richard Scheines) were supported by the National Science Foundation, the Buhl Foundation and by an internal Seed Grant from Carnegie Mellon. From September 2006 to August 2010, I was the PI of the NSF supported project that develops a web-based logic course treating three fundamental concepts: proof, function, and computation; see [APros project](http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/apros/).
