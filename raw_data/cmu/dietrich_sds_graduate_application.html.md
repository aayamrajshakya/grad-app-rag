# Frequently Asked Questions
## Please carefully read these Frequently Asked Questions for important information regarding our application instructions and procedures.
## Application Basics
### How do I get an application?
The application is [available online](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/graduate/apply) beginning September 15. 
### What should be in my application?
You must submit a completed application, which requires an unofficial copy of transcripts from all college or university work to date, three letters of recommendation, a 2-page essay, GRE scores, TOEFL cores scores if English is not your native language, your resume/vita, and a sample of your writing (optional).
GRE and TOEFL Scores: Please have ETS send your official GRE and TOEFL scores electronically.
Transcripts: Applicants are required to provide unofficial transcript copies from any undergraduate or graduate institution attended. These documents are required for submission of the application. If the department recommends that you be admitted, you will then be asked to submit official transcripts. Only upon receipt of official transcripts will your admission be official. Please do not send official transcripts until you have been offered admission.
Please note that transcripts and test scores may not be marked as received until you have entered all of the information in those particular sections of your application and completed your biographical information. Please submit your application as soon as possible so we can process your documents.
### What information should I include in my 2-page essay?
Please address the following questions: Why do you wish to do graduate work in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences? What attracts you to our doctoral program in particular? Describe your academic interests, including the type of research that you are interested in pursuing. What are your major career goals after completing your study at Carnegie Mellon University?
### Should I discuss my identity?
If you are a member of an underrepresented or minoritized group you are welcome to indicate this directly in your application, if you are comfortable doing so. This can be sensitive and you may be apprehensive. Please know that our department is committed to diversifying science across gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and socioeconomic dimensions. We are cognizant that individuals from many groups have been excluded from science and, being driven by empirical data that back up this point, we understand that a lack of diversity hurts our science as well as our commitment to a diverse, inclusive, and equitable society. Sharing identity information with us can help us to explore creative solutions to funding, fellowships, etc. and to point you toward resources. You might wonder when you should share this information. You might weave this into the Research Application, note it in the application materials, or have a direct conversation with your prospective faculty mentor in an email or video chat.
### Where should I send my official supporting documents?
Please send them to sds-phd-apply@andrew.cmu.edu.
### What are you looking for in the application materials?
We consider your academic training, research experiences, letters of recommendation, GRE scores, and other available information in our admission decisions. We accept the candidates with the best background and fit to the department. We don't have cut-off scores for GRE, GPA or TOEFL, but top scores are expected as our program is highly competitive.
### Am I qualified to apply to your Ph.D. program?
Our office will not pre-screen or examine any materials (CV, GRE scores, transcripts, experience, etc.) prior to the official submission of your application. If you are interested in our Ph.D. program, you are encouraged to apply.
### I used my User ID and password, but I cannot access the online application. What is the problem?
If your browser accepts cookies, and your computer is not behind a firewall, then you should be able to log in successfully. Also, please make sure you are using the same website to log into that you used to register. If you continue to have problems accessing your application, please contact: sds-phd-apply@andrew.cmu.edu
### I do not see my college/university listed in the drop-down box in the Education section of the application. What should I do?
You can still enter the university information in your application and click the save button. The application system will save this information to your application. 
However, please email us at sds-phd-apply@andrew.cmu.edu to let us know your college/university is not in the drop-down box. We will need to know the full name and address of the school. Please also include the country if it is an international school. We will add the name of your school to the drop-down box so it is there in the future.
### I have a question concerning the application process. Where do I go for help?
If you are unable to find an answer to your question in the FAQ, then send email to sds-phd-apply@andrew.cmu.edu.
### Can I make changes to my online application after it has been submitted?
Once your application has been submitted, you may only make changes to specific materials: CV, Statement of Purpose, and Publications. You can make these changes in the Update Document section of the Status Portal. You may also monitor and track your Letters of Recommendation via the Status Portal as well.
### I have already uploaded my Resume/Statement of Purpose, but now I have made revisions and would like to submit the new version. What should I do?
Once your application has been submitted, you may only make changes to specific materials: CV, Statement of Purpose, and Publications. You can make these changes in the Update Document section of the Status Portal. However, you may not make any changes to your application after the December 15 deadline
### I have requested my transcripts and test scores be sent, but my application has not been updated? 
You must first submit your application and pay the application fee before receipt of test scores or transcripts will be updated. They must be matched and updated manually, and this may take several days to reflect receipt of these documents.
### What do I do if my email address or current address changes before the end of the semester?
You may change your current address, email address and password in your submitted application until the December 15 deadline. If there is any change after this date, please send email to sds-phd-apply@andrew.cmu.edu, and the coordinator will make the necessary updates. It is very important that you maintain a valid email address in your submitted application.
### If I applied last year and was not admitted, can I reapply this year?

# Ph.D. Alumni Profile
##    
Assistant Professor of Behavioural Science, London School of Economics and Political Science
What do you love about your current position?
I love how intellectually diverse the department is—people study human behavior from so many angles, using every kind of method—but there’s always a shared focus on real-world impact. I also love the department’s thoughtful approach to teaching and the support it gives instructors to create great classes.
How do you utilize your SDS training in your current position? In particular, how has the interdisciplinary nature of SDS doctoral training benefitted you in your current job?
SDS gave me a model for the kind of academic home I wanted —one where people from different fields talk to each other, share ideas, and collaborate. It taught me to think across disciplines instead of staying in one lane, and that’s been incredibly useful at LSE, where behavioral science sits right at the crossroads of psychology, economics, and policy.
Please share a favorite moment of your time in SDS. It might be an anecdote, an event, a particular course or person who taught you a lot, or a project you started in graduate school.
I loved the department lab meetings. Having a set time to present my research (even if it was still just a nascent idea) and to hear what others were doing, in an informal, collegial setting was an amazing experience for a student —something I haven’t quite found anywhere else I’ve been. I also loved the bullpen (our office space), where I could always break up a difficult day of work with gossip and laughter with fellow grad students. I’m writing this in my lovely but lonely office and missing that very much.
What advice would you give to current Ph.D. students, or to students considering applying to the SDS Ph.D. program?
For current students: enjoy it! As wonderful as teaching can be, it’s amazing to have so many years to just explore your curiosity and focus on research. To students considering applying: Do it! SDS (and Pittsburgh) are wonderful. But, more seriously: even if you have strong research interests, come with an open mind to new topics and collaborations.
