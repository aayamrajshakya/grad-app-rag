Biometrics—characteristics about a person unique to them and no one else, such as their fingerprint, their iris, or features in their face—are becoming an increasingly popular method of authenticating a person’s identity. Carnegie Mellon University CyLab researchers are working on improving the accuracy of biometric systems with robust development and testing and keeping in mind ways adversaries may try to spoof these systems. In addition, one goal of CyLab’s biometric researchers is making biometric identification an effortless, thoughtless task.
