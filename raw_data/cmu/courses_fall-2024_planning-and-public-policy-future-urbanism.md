U.S. Policy Timeline from Enslavement to the Present
The focus of this seminar is to understand how practices and policies from American plantation life to the modern U.S. city have created racial and economic inequality, human exposure to environmental hazards and climate risks, and how community organizing power has altered these conditions at all levels of government.
U.S. cities are confronting the unlikely, but inevitable evolution and confluence of the topics of race; climate and environment in urban planning and policy-making; and the political backlash to social and scientific progress over the last 70 years. This course explores these topics and how community engagement, movement building, and radical imagination since the 1960s have led to a desire for racial equality in cities; national action on environmental justice; and global activism on climate change, which are all under threat.
