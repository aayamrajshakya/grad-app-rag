## Bio
What does firefighting have in common with quantitative finance? They both require getting out of one’s comfort zone. Parfait Kabore graduated from Colgate University in 2023 with a bachelor in Economics and Applied Mathematics, through which he built a strong foundation in mathematical modeling, economic analysis, and programming. He worked as a research consultant in health economics, where he conducted research and data collection on the biopharmaceutical industry in the orphan disease section. Parfait then joined the investment office at his alma mater’s endowment fund, where he was a portfolio management analyst focused on research, due diligence, and reporting. While there, Parfait took and passed the first two levels of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) certification. He also undertook volunteer firefighting and earned his certification as a New York State firefighter 1. Curiosity and a desire to get out of his comfort zone also led Parfait to MSCF, where he will strive to sharpen his mathematical, econometric, data science, and programming skills for applications in the financial markets. Upon graduation, he plans to pursue a career in quantitative research and trading.
