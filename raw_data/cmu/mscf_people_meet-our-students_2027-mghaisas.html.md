## Bio
I'm someone who finds joy in untangling complex problems and extracting meaning from data, be it through machine learning or stochastic analysis. I graduated from Purdue University with a double major in Computer Science (Machine Learning Concentration) and Mathematics, and am continuing my education through a Master's in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University.  
  
Through internships, scalable personal projects, research projects, and advanced coursework, I have developed extensive knowledge and hands-on experience in machine learning and financial markets. I am specifically interested in applying game theory and machine learning concepts to quantitative finance and expanding this knowledge base in a fast-paced environment.  
  
I have always believed that learning doesn't stop in the classroom or on screen: you'll find me immersed in reading books for hours or enjoying stories and culture through food and travel. One of my favorite memories has been teaching young, underprivileged, tribal girls how to read in English using just a phone.  
  
If you are looking for a quant intern who is strong in coding, passionate about financial mathematics, has attention to detail, and an insatiable curiosity, please reach out to me.
