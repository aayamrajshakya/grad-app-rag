#  Education 
Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania
#  Research 
My research interests are in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, in particular combinatorics on words, q-analogs and lattice paths statistics. Currently I am working on problems related to Super Catalan Numbers and Polynomials. I have taught a wide variety of undergraduate courses at CMU, among them Concepts of Mathematics, Combinatorics, Differential Equations, Matrix Algebra and Algebraic Structures.
