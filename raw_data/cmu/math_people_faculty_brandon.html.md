# Deborah Brandon
## Associate Teaching Professor Emeritus
Address:  
Department of Mathematical Sciences  
Carnegie Mellon University  
5000 Forbes Avenue  
Pittsburgh, PA 15213

#  Education 
Ph.D., Carnegie Mellon University
Postdoctoral Appointments:
  * Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University
  * University of Minnesota
  * University of Wisconsin-Madison


#  Research 
My research interest are in partial differential equations, integrodifferential equations, and nonconvex variational problems, with applications in continuum mechanics.
In addition to my regular teaching duties, I'm the teaching assistant (TA) supervisor for the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
In this capacity, I run a TA training workshop, as well as an international TA training workshop (for incoming international graduate students who need to pass an English language test before they become TAs). I am also the director of the SUAMI (Summer Undergraduate Applied Mathematics Institute) - an annual outreach program of the Department of Mathematical Sciences.
