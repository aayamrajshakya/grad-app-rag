## Bio
As a former 10-meter air rifle athlete who competed alongside Olympic champions, I learned the power of attention and quick decisions. Today, I bring that same drive to quantitative finance.  
  
Graduating from Fudan University with a degree in Statistics, I have a strong foundation in probability, statistical modeling, Python, and C++. My passion for quant investing led me to internships as a Quantitative Researcher at China International Capital Corporation, Ruiyi Investment, and Cquant Asset, where I focused on factor discovery and model development.  
  
I am also a machine learning enthusiast, especially in large language models. At Ruitian Investment, I helped build a multi-agent system using GPT and Qwen3, optimizing retrieval-augmented generation for finance and investment tasks. I am committed to exploring how AI agents can boost the speed, accuracy, and creativity of financial research.  
  
If you are looking for someone who combines technical skill, hands-on experience, and a sharp competitive edge, I am ready to add value to your team.
