## Bio
I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2025 with a double bachelor's degree in Finance and Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate years, I pursued industry experience by engaging in several quantitative research internships at top quant hedge funds in China. At Mingxi Capital, I constructed a sentiment factor using news data, gaining a peek into alternative data investment. I also reproduced many factors and algorithms from research reports and papers, enhancing my Python programming. At Dunhe Fund, I further improved my alpha construction and analysis skills using price and volume. At Qilin Investment, I obtained more insight into how factors as a whole work in quantitative investment, especially in generating different kinds of signals. Apart from these, I also participated in volunteering activities and directed volunteers at large events, improving leadership abilities. I enrolled in the MSCF Program to further improve my skills in solving problems of financial markets using quantitative methods. Upon graduation, I plan to pursue a career in quantitative research, quantitative trading, and asset management.
