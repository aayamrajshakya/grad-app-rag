## Bio
My interest in finance sparked at age 11, watching my dad navigate the stock market's ups and downs. Over time, I came to see that mathematics and computer science form the backbone of modern finance, and that's why I joined CMU's MSCF program.  
  
I aim to join a fast-paced trading firm or hedge fund where I can apply my skills in quantitative analysis, coding, and behavioral modeling to develop trading strategies. I bring my knowledge in Python, mathematics, and statistics- along with the mindset of a trader who thrives under pressure and makes quick, reasoned decisions.  
  
I hold a computer science degree from UC San Diego and founded Triton Quantitative Trading, the university's first student-led quant finance club. I completed my undergraduate degree in just three years with a 3.96 GPA, while serving as club President and a CS tutor, showcasing my drive, focus, and ability to master complex material under time constraints.  
  
I know the road ahead will be challenging. But what's the fun in life if I don't aim as high as I can? I'm very passionate and eager to step into the world of quantitative finance.  
  
I'm available to connect via Zoom or in person to discuss how I can contribute to your team's success.
