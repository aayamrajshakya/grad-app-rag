# Global Cultures and Emerging Technology
* * *
### Exploring the intersection of culture and technology for success in an interconnected world. 
* * *
## Program Overview
The Global Cultures and Emerging Technology (GCET) Program offers high school students a unique opportunity to explore the intersection of culture and technology. By participating in this program, students will develop critical thinking and intercultural communication skills, enhance their technical expertise, and cultivate their sense of global citizenship. Through a blend of foundational coursework and hands-on research/project labs, students will engage in interdisciplinary learning that prepares them for the complexities of a rapidly evolving world. This program fosters creativity, ethical technology development, and collaborative problem-solving, equipping students with the tools they need to succeed in an interconnected society.
## Curriculum 
Over five weeks, Global Cultures and Emerging Technology students will progress through three phases culminating in a unique interdisciplinary project to be showcased at a final symposium. Throughout the program, students will:
  * explore interdisciplinary innovationaddress global challenges through creative, human-centered solutions
  * build hands-on expertise analyzing the cultural and ethical implications
  * cultivate global citizenship ethical responsibility in technology development
  * advance academic success  foundational knowledge, critical thinking skills, and interdisciplinary problem-solving skills
  * develop a multifaceted portfoliotechnical and cultural fluency 
  * build leadership, communication, and collaboration competence 


## Phase 1: Foundational Coursework on Global Cultures
Weeks 1-2: Foundational Coursework on Global Cultures
This component features guest professors and cultural specialists who guide students in analyzing the cultural products, practices, and perspectives of diverse global communities, with a special focus on their relationship to technological development. Emphasizing critical thinking and intercultural communication, this core element prepares students to engage thoughtfully with the complexities of our interconnected world.
## Phase 2: Research/Project Lab
Weeks 3-5: Research/Project Lab
In this phase, students will apply their learning in Phase 1 to an interdisciplinary group research/project that merges global cultures with technological fields. Students will work in small groups of 4 to 6, each guided by 1 to 2 faculty mentors. During this phase, students will participate in the following activities:
  * Research/Project Methodology Workshops
These workshops offer foundational training in interdisciplinary research and project design, equipping students with the essential skills to conceptualize and execute their projects. Based on their group assignments, students will participate in one of the following workshops: XR, Robotics, AIGC, Animation, or Game Design.
  * Research/Project Labs
Following the workshops, students participate in one of the faculty-led labs where they collaborate in small teams under the guidance of faculty mentors and research assistants. Sample research/project labs proposed for Summer 2026 (subject to change) include: 
    * AI, Robotics, and the Future of Art Exhibitions
    * Animating Language and Culture with Duolingo
    * Revitalizing Historical Artifacts Through Game Design


## Phase 3: Research/Project Showcase and Symposium
Weeks 5: Research/Project Showcase and Symposium
The program culminates in a symposium where students present their interdisciplinary projects to faculty, peers, and industry guests. During the symposium, students articulate their research methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and ethical considerations, demonstrating their ability to communicate sophisticated ideas to diverse audiences.
## End Product
Students will produce a portfolio that showcases their interdisciplinary studies, which will include, but are not limited to, the following deliverables:
  * Group Research/Project Prototypes:
  * Documentation and Reflection:
  * Digital Exhibits:


## College Preparatory Activities
The program offers coursework, workshops, and lab training designed to prepare students for the demands of college-level studies. The coursework emphasizes critical thinking and essential research skills. Through workshops and labs, students will apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts, enhancing their technical skills while fostering collaboration, technological innovation, and creative problem-solving.
At the end of the program, students will receive a collection of materials to enhance their portfolios, including a project prototype, professors' assessments and feedback, documentation of their learning process, and materials prepared for digital exhibits that highlight their work and insights. These comprehensive resources will serve as valuable assets as students prepare to transition into their college studies.
