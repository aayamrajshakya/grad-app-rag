Engineering and Public Policy offers an M.S. program that gives students skills to address policy issues where the scientific and technical details matter.
If you want to tackle the complex problems of today’s society by applying knowledge of science, technology, economics, and social analysis, the EPP MS program may be right for you.
Our students have a variety of technical backgrounds from their prior degrees or professional experience. While most students have a science or engineering undergraduate degree, we also consider social scientists with an interest in technology issues and a strong quantitative background. EPP students go on to careers in government, business, consulting, academia, and non-profits around the world.
