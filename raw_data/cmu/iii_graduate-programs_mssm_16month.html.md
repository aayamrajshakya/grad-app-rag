##### Product Manager InternServiceNow
I was a Product Manager Intern at **[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/company.html)** in Santa Clara, focusing on workflow automation. My main project involved designing and implementing a certification process for production automations to address operational inefficiencies and risks from outdated scripts and applications. The goal was to streamline operations by removing unused workflows and maintaining updated ownership information. Key challenges included navigating a large organization to find the right contacts and managing a vast data set of over 2,200 workflows and 700 scripts. These experiences helped me improve my networking skills, data organization, and prioritization abilities.

##### Inbound Product Manager InternServiceNow
I served as an AI specialist at **[ServiceNow](https://www.servicenow.com/company.html),** managing a multilingual Responsible AI Bot and developing AI governance strategies. My role involved simplifying complex AI concepts and aligning diverse teams. I created an AI Bot that dramatically improved response times, from 40 minutes to 4 seconds, winning over beta testers. Key challenges included unifying five teams around a shared data model, balancing explanations for both AI experts and beginners, and navigating ambiguity in decision-making. Handling AI governance felt like coordinating five teams with differing technical perspectives—a true balancing act.
