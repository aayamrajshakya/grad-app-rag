# Office of Research Integrity and Compliance (ORIC)
We are here to support research at Carnegie Mellon University and work with researchers to ensure that research is conducted in accordance with federal and state regulations. We strive to foster compliance without impeding the process of research.
ORIC assists researchers in the following areas:
  * [Human Subjects Research (IRB)](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/human-subjects-research/index.html) - IRB assures appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and welfare of humans participating in research. The IRB functions according to the guidelines of the Office of Human Research Protection (OHRP) and other federal regulatory agencies.


  * [Conflict of Interest (COI)](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/conflict-of-interest/index.html "A link to the Conflict of Interest website") - The purpose of Conflict of Interest regulations and policy is to promote objectivity in research and ensure unbiased design, conduct and reporting of research. Federal regulations and CMU policy require that individuals involved in sponsored research disclose potential or actual conflicts of interest. ORIC receives the disclosures and if necessary assists with mitigation of the conflict.


  * [Organizational Conflict of Interest (OCI)](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/organizational-conflict-of-interest/index.html "A link to the Organizational Conflict of Interest website") - The purpose of Organizational Conflict of Interest regulation is to ensure that research serves the national and public interest and is guided soley by objective results of the scientific method. Potential or actual conflicts must be disclosed and evaluated to determine their potential for creating bias or unfair advantage. ORIC receives the disclosures and if necessary assists with mitigation of the conflict.


  * [Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR)](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/responsible-conduct/index.html "A link to the Responsible Conduct of Research website") - RCR incorporates a set of ethical standards in nine key topic areas that when applied results in responsible and ethical research of the highest standard. ORIC sponsors a number of RCR education programs. 


  * [Global Export Compliance](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/export-controls/index.html "A link to the Export Controls website") - Export compliance is compliance, required by law, with regulations, both in the U.S. and in other countries that CMU operates in, related to the control of exports, which include the physical shipment of tangible items AND the transfer of information to non-U.S. persons both abroad and in the U.S.


  * [Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC)](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/animal-research/index.html "A link to the Animal Studies website") - Federal regulations govern the use and care of animals in research. Strict standards regarding the housing, husbandry and research procedures must be adhered to by all members of the research team. ORIC provides oversight for these activities via the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).


  * [Research Misconduct](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/research-misconduct/index.html "A link to the Research Misconduct website") - Occasionally individuals in the research community are concerned that research is being conducted in a manner that is outside the norms of behavior for research. This could include falsification or fabrication of data, plagiarism or other types of unethical behavior. ORIC is responsible for handling allegations of research misconduct.
