Research to expand the additive manufacturing capabilities of aerosol jet printing (AJP) with self-healing nanocomposite inks will include the development of a digital twin of the AJP system that will be used to model and fabricate mesoscale building blocks with controlled size, uniform shape, and structural complexity that can be used to design and fabricate multifunctional mesoscale self-healing devices.
