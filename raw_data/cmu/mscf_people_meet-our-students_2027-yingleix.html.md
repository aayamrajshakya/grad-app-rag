## Bio
Yinglei Xu graduated from UNC-Chapel Hill with a double major in Economics and Statistics. She has developed a strong foundation in quantitative research through multiple internships at leading financial institutions and academic projects in portfolio optimization. She joined the MSCF program to deepen her technical and market knowledge and to prepare for a career in quantitative research or trading.  
  
At GF Fund Management, one of China's top mutual funds, Yinglei applied evolutionary algorithms to enhance alpha factor mining, improving IC by 20% and Rank IC by 18%. She also introduced a PCA-based Quality Diversity (PCA-QD) framework to increase signal robustness and built a dual-effects model capturing both intra-industry reversal and inter-industry momentum. Her work contributed to stronger strategy interpretability and performance. During a prior internship at Essence Securities, she conducted industry risk attribution and constructed options-based hedging strategies across equity and bond portfolios.  
  
Yinglei's honors thesis focused on applying reinforcement learning methods-including A2C, PPO, TD3, and SAC-to optimize S&P 500 portfolio allocation, with an emphasis on cumulative asset value as a reward structure. Her work combined machine learning techniques with financial intuition and rigorous backtesting.  
  
After graduation, Yinglei seeks to join a quantitative research or trading team, where she can design and implement data-driven strategies. She is passionate about financial modeling, equity markets, and strategy development, and brings a blend of research innovation and coding precision to the table..
