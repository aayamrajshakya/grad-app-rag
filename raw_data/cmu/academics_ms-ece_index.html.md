Students in the Master of Science (MS) in ECE program are provided with a thorough background in the fundamentals of electrical and computer engineering, as well as the opportunity for in-depth specialization in some particular aspect of these fields. Upon enrollment in the department, students are given the opportunity, with the help of an academic advisor and faculty mentor, to choose an educational program consistent with their background and best-suited to their own academic goals.

## Academic integrity policy
The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering adheres to the academic integrity policies set forth by Carnegie Mellon University and the College of Engineering. ECE students should carefully review [Carnegie Mellon University's policies regarding Cheating and Plagiarism](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html), [Undergraduate Academic Discipline](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/AcadRegs.html), and [Graduate Academic Discipline](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/GradDisc.html). ECE graduate students should further review the Penalties for Graduate Student Academic Integrity Violations in CIT outlined in the . In addition to the above university- and college-level policies, it is ECE's policy that an ECE graduate student may not drop a course in which a disciplinary action is assessed or pending without the course instructor's explicit approval. Further, an ECE course instructor may set their own course-specific academic integrity policies that do not conflict with university- and college-level policies; course-specific policies should be made available to students in writing in the first week of class.
