Professor Russell has a keen interest in interdisciplinary research and teaching. He earned a B.A. in English and a Ph.D. in biology en route to becoming a historian. His research methods often synthesize history with biology, especially ecology, evolution, and neuroscience. Professor Russell came to Carnegie Mellon in 2019 partly because of the university’s emphasis on creative, interdisciplinary work.
