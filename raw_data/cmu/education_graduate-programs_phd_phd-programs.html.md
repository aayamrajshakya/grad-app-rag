The Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering prepares students for careers in research and academia. Our collaborative faculty are investigating a diverse range of research areas like additive manufacturing, air quality, cellular biomechanics, computational design, DNA origami, energy conversion and storage, nanoscale manufacturing, soft robotics, transdermal drug delivery, transport phenomena, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.

## Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering
Students typically complete the Ph.D. degree requirements in three to five years. Early in the program, students focus on course-work that enhances their knowledge as they prepare to conduct research.
Within one year, students must pass the departmental qualifying exam, an oral exam that tests research skills and knowledge of a core mechanical engineering subject area.
Student research forms the core of the Ph.D. program. Research involves active student-directed inquiry into an engineering problem, culminating in a written thesis and oral defense.
### Ph.D. Financial Support
The majority of full-time Ph.D. students accepted through the standard application process receive fellowships that cover full tuition, the technology fee, and a stipend for living expenses for up to five years, as long as sufficient progress is made toward degree completion. These awards are sufficient to cover all expenses for the year (including summers). Students are required to pay for health insurance, the transportation fee, the activity fee, books, and course supplies. Off-campus housing is available within walking distance of campus. At least one year of residency is required for the Ph.D. We offer two ways to enter the Ph.D. program.
* Edgar Mendoza earned the prestigious National Science Foundation’s Graduate Research Fellowship to study the emerging and interdisciplinary field of ceramic additive manufacturing. 
* Purva Joshi investigates how to protect biomaterials from the harmful effects of ice crystals during cryopreservation. This research will impact the future of biobanking and transplant medicine.
* Justin Bobo uses nerve-on-a-chip technology to study the biomechanics of neurons in traumatic brain injury. He is developing a miniature, 3D model that physiologically mimics the microenvironment of the brain’s neural network.
* Students celebrate after the annual Graduate Student Research Symposium. 
### Advanced entry Ph.D.
The advanced entry Ph.D. is for students with an M.S. in an engineering discipline or equivalent field.
### Direct Ph.D.
The direct Ph.D. is for students entering the program with a B.S. in an engineering discipline or equivalent field.
