## Bio
I am currently pursuing the Master of Science in Computational Finance (MSCF) at Carnegie Mellon University after graduating from the University of Michigan with a double major in Mathematical Science and Statistics. Previously, I worked in product and actuarial pricing, focusing on pricing models, adjustments, and reserve assumptions to support financial decisions and manage risk. I am passionate about using mathematical modeling, statistical methods, and programming to help organizations make informed decisions. My goal is to join a collaborative team in quantitative research, trading, or risk management, where I can keep growing professionally and contribute to impactful work. I would be glad to connect to explore how my background and enthusiasm can support your firm's success.
