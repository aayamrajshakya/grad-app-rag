## Bio
As a student who earned full marks in every statistics and mathematics exam throughout my bachelor's degree, I never finished second. The ponder, composure, and boldness mirror my mindset in the boxing ring, where I thrive on the thrill of giving my all.  
  
I am eager to join a fast-paced quant team as an analyst, where I can apply my statistical strengths and machine learning expertise to drive innovation. By building efficient regression models and multi-factor strategies, I will deliver precise insights on stock prices and portfolio management, empowering your firm to stay ahead of the market.  
  
During my recent internship, I forecasted the CPI and PPI from June to December 2025 and analyzed their relationships with forty-one industries, identifying those that performed well in inflation and deflation. This analysis lined up surprisingly well with my quantitative model's stock picks. This experience introduced me to new ideas beyond mathematical analysis, expanding my horizons to a macro level and enabling me to merge statistics with macro trends for more powerful predictions.  
  
I am available to meet with you on Zoom or in person at your convenience to show you how I can benefit your company. Please email me at: tianyuwu@andrew.cmu.edu
