# Plan of Study
The MSE Scalable and Embedded Systems programs are both 16-month long and consist of three traditional semesters and one summer internship. The programs begin in the fall and conclude the following year in December. While the summer session is reserved exclusively for the requisite internship, the second fall semester is dedicated to an intensive practicum project.
Courses in the first year are divided into 7-week mini-semesters to allow students to concurrently learn a wider range of topics, while scaffolding learning to more advanced topics later in the program. For example, Semester 1-2 is the second half of the first program semester, normally in the Fall.
