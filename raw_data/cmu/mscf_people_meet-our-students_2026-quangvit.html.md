## Bio
Prior to joining CMU's Masters in Computational Finance program, I obtained a Bachelors degree in Mathematics from Temple University and a Masters degree in Statistics from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, which not gave me a strong quantitative foundation in probability, statistics and programming, but also exposure to the modern usage of machine learning and neural networks in quantitative finance. I also have worked in the finance sector for 1.5 years, with my most recent role as a Quantitative Risk Analyst in Vietcombank, one of the Big 4 banks in my country, providing me with opportunities to apply machine learning techniques such as regression and classification trees into credit risk modeling, as well as optimizing workflows using Python/SAS scripts and automated dashboards. I am driven by my thirst for knowledge, my curiosity towards complex and interesting problems, and my motivation to compete with others and learn where I stand in this world, with CMU's Masters in Computational Finance being my next step towards my aspiration to become a quantitative researcher.
