A Theory of Speculation in Digital Assets
Abstract
We model a digital platform where users learn about the quality of its services over time by using its native tokens. The key friction is users can buy tokens for services or trade them primarily for speculation. In the presence of strong network effects, this tension can lead to situations where no user adopts the platform’s services because the benefit of adoption is lower than that from speculation. Our model can be applied to any digital asset that derives value from network effects and suggests high token inflation and incentive schemes favoring service usage may be integral to sustaining participation.
