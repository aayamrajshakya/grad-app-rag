Susan Markham is the Director of the Peace With Women Fellowship program at the  
Halifax International Security Forum (HFX). HFX is dedicated to strengthening strategic  
cooperation among democratic nations. HFX was founded in 2009 as part of the  
German Marshall Fund of the United States and became an independent organization  
in 2011.
Susan most recently served as a partner and co-founder of Smash Strategies, a  
consulting firm that helps institutions achieve better results by focusing on women's  
leadership and gender equality. With experience in over 50 countries, she is a strategic  
leader who is appreciated for her energy, straight talk and insight, connecting  
academics, activists, implementers and ideas across sectors.
Previously, she served at the United States Agency for International Development  
(USAID) as the Senior Coordinator for Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment. In  
this position, she advised Agency leadership on gender policy issues, led cross-sectoral  
program efforts in resilience, adolescent girls’ education and energy, and represented  
the Agency to the White House and other departments, governments, civil society  
organizations and private partners. She coordinated USAID efforts on the annual  
reporting and update to the U.S. Strategy to Prevent and Respond to Gender-Based  
Violence Globally and the U.S. National Action Plan on Women, Peace and Security.
From 2010 to 2014, Susan led the efforts of the National Democratic Institute (NDI) to  
increase women’s political participation around the world in 70 countries to be equal and  
active partners in shaping and leading democratic societies. Specifically, she provided  
technical support to NDI’s $10 million in stand-alone programs focused on engaging  
women in legislatures, political parties and civil society as voters, activists, candidates  
and officeholders.
Susan worked earlier in her career in U.S. politics. At EMILY’s List, she ran the Political  
Opportunity Program (POP) where she supervised a staff of eight working with the $2.5  
million POP program that recruited, trained and supported women running for statewide,  
legislative and local office. She also managed the Campaign Corps program that  
brought young people into the political process to both engage them in elections and  
help pro-choice, Democratic women candidates win. In the process, she helped other  
organizations like Hopefund and the New Organizing Institute create similar programs  
specifically focused on young people of color and the (then) new online tools.
Previously, she worked at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) as  
Director of Senate Services, Participation 2000 as the Executive Director, and managed  
and raised funds for federal and state campaigns in Ohio, Missouri, Kentucky, Arizona  
and Tennessee.
Susan now works and lives in Washington, DC with her family and two dogs. She  
earned a Master’s of Arts degree in Public Policy and Women’s Studies from George  
Washington University and a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and International  
Studies from the Ohio State University.
