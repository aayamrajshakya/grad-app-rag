# Law of US Democracy
## Course Number: 84-633 
This course will examine democracy from a legal perspective. It will include sections on civil rights, and in particular minority voting rights. It will also cover legal and constitutional constructs, like the Elections Clause, how and when a state can restrict ballot access for candidates, associational rights for political parties, campaign finance legal frameworks, and other things, all while reading the Supreme Court cases relevant to these topics.
