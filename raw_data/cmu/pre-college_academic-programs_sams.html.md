# Updates for Summer 2026 coming soon!
#  Summer Academy for Math and Science 
### Providing opportunities for students from underrepresented communities to explore STEM-related fields.
## Program Overview
For over twenty years, the Summer Academy for Math and Science (SAMS) program has engaged students in a rigorous curriculum taught by faculty and staff who are deeply committed to student success. Led by the [Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion](https://www.cmu.edu/student-diversity/), SAMS allows students to develop a deeper understanding of STEM via traditional classroom instruction, through hands-on projects, and sustained engagement with world-renowned faculty and skilled staff mentors. In addition to their academic experiences, students also have the opportunity to collaborate and develop meaningful relationships with peers from across the country.  
  
Through SAMS and other outreach initiatives, the university:
  * Develops 
  * Strengthens 
  * Broadens 
  * Equips 


## Curriculum 
The Summer Academy for Math and Science will consist of 2 parts:
PART 1: required virtual Jumpstart
PART 2: 
SAMS is a fully funded, merit-based program. There is no cost for scholars to participate. We expect all SAMS Scholars to participate fully for the duration of the program. We understand that students may be applying to multiple summer opportunities, however if selected for SAMS, scholars will not be permitted to participate in any other programs (virtual or in person) if program dates conflict. If you have any questions, please reach out to cmu-sams@andrew.cmu.edu.
## Academic Experience
  * Students will complete Quantitative and Computational Skill seminars that compose the academic core:
    * Math
    * Science
    * STEM-related research project that is advised by a STEM faculty and/or graduate student
  * Students will participate in weekly writing workshops with a focus on college application preparation.
  * Students will successfully complete “Student to Scholar,” which is a credit-bearing course designed to help students better understand who they are, who they want to be, and learn what it takes to get there. This research-based course assists students as they prepare for their transition from high school to college.
  * Students will attend workshops led by alumni, students, university leaders, and local industry leaders. Topics include STEM-related research, career exploration, and presentations on college admission and financial aid.
  * Students will meet in mentoring small groups facilitated by the Center for Student Diversity & Inclusion.
  * Students will participate in and learn more about collaborative learning through group tutoring and academic coaching sessions offered through the Student Academic Success Center.


## SAMS Symposium
  * SAMS culminates with the day-long Symposium which includes a Closing Awards Ceremony and STEM project student presentations. Families and caregivers are welcome to attend either in person or via livestream.


## Sustaining Connections & Engagement Experiences
These connections will be ongoing and virtual.
  * Students will have the opportunity to participate in on-going virtual enrichment sessions, such as FAFSA, college prep, budgeting, and info sessions on additional development opportunities. Families and caregivers will be invited to attend relevant sessions.
  * Students will interact with current Carnegie Mellon community members to explore STEM majors and opportunities at CMU.


## A Glimpse into Project Courses…
### Project: Investigations into the Versatile Applications of Polymer Chemistry
Students get hands-on experience with polymerization processes for various application designs. Safe lab practices and behavior is emphasized.

## Financial Need
Summer Academy for Math & Science utilizes a holistic application review and admissions process, looking at the full application and selecting program participants based on a combination of factors. Because we are a fully funded, merit-based program for participants, demonstration of financial need is one of these factors. There is no option for participants to pay out of pocket tuition fees for this program, and financial documentation is required for application submission.
