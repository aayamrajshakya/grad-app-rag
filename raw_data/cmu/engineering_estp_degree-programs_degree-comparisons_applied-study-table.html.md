# Applied Study Degree Comparisons
The two Applied Study Degrees build directly off of each of the two [Foundational Degrees](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/foundational-table.html) by integrating 3 units of career and professional development (39-699) and 3 units related to a summer internship* (distributed over two courses), for an additional six units to the total units of the appropriate Foundational Degree, with no added time to degree completion.
A side-by-side comparison of the Applied Study Degrees are given in this Table, which highlights how the Applied Study requirements (bottom row) add six units to an existing, individual Foundational Degree (the foundational degrees still build from left to right in the number of units and semesters required, as well as in degree customizability).
