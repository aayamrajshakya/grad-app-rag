# Private Loans
Private loan programs offer competitive interest rates and borrower benefits. To increase chances of approval and possibly improve the rate you receive, students are strongly recommended to apply with a creditworthy co-signer. Some lenders require students to apply with a co-signer regardless of your income or credit rating. Look at each loan program for these requirements. Private loans are also available for parents or guardians. Those applying for private loans should complete the Private Loan Certification Form (pdf).
## FASTChoice
[FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200) is a loan comparison service offered free-of-charge to schools by the Great Lakes Higher Education Corporation. Private loan options are available for both students and parents.
# Tips:
  * Pay interest while in school to reduce overall indebtedness
  * Obtain a free copy of your credit report at [www.annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com/) and resolve any errors
  * Compare the interest rates, fees and repayment terms of all student loan products
  * Only borrow the amount you need to meet your educational costs
  * Federal Student Loans should be borrowed before


### Private Student Loans
Private student loans are offered through private lenders within [FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200). These are through the student's name and a credit check is used to determine eligibility. By applying with a creditworthy individual (for example, a parent or guardian), the student may improve chances of approval.
### Private Parent Loans
Private parent loans are also offered through private lenders within [FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200). These are private loans that a parent or guardian can borrow on behalf of a student and a credit check is used to determine eligibility.
### International Students
Some private loans are offered to Carnegie Mellon students. Eligible students interested in applying for this loan can do so with or without a co-signer through [FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200). 
## Compare & Apply
Once in [FASTChoice](https://choice.fastproducts.org/FastChoice/home/324200), students and parents will be able to compare various loan programs and link directly to the lender of their choice to begin an application.
