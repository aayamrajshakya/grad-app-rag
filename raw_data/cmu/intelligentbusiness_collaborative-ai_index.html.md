# Collaborative AI
* * *
The Tepper School of Business prepares students to be the next generation of business leaders in an ever-fluid and advancing business world. We are guided by a mission to transform the world, pioneering and innovating at the intersection of business, technology, and analytics. This research mission is synergistic with our educational mission.   
  
A key focus is to apply collaborativeAI -- the integration of generative AI, traditional analytics and data with human collaboration -- to transform business education. Our long-term‬‭ goal‬‭ is to‬‭ transform our‬‭ own‬‭ curriculum‬‭ at‬‭ Tepper,‬‭ and‬‭ ideate new and unique alternatives to traditional business cases.‬ The coAI fellows will develop new‬ educational modules‬ in their courses for the upcoming academic year.
Projects include:
  * Guiding students studying business analytics through using AI tools to build effective data visualizations that are tailored to specific audiences and communication scenarios.
  * Creating an AI coach that supports undergraduate students as they learn database management techniques.This coach will assist with the most complicated aspects of coding, freeing students to focus on higher-order objectives.
  * Coaching students through AI simulations that will teach them strategies for effective, inclusive conflict management.
