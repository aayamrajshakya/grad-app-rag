# Special Financial or Unusual Circumstance Requests
Carnegie Mellon students have the right to request changes to their financial aid based on Special Financial Circumstances (i.e., recent unemployment, changes to income, assets) or based on Unusual Circumstances that may qualify a student for a change in dependency status. The Student Financial Aid Office may exercise its professional judgment by modifying data used to calculate the Student Aid Index (SAI), making changes to cost of attendance factors, or changing a student’s dependency status from a dependent student to an independent student based on certain legal definitions and documentation. Students should note that any approved requests may impact access to Federal Pell Grants and/or other types of financial aid.
Enrolled students should be aware student account interest is applied at the end of August on any remaining balance due to Carnegie Mellon. We encourage students to submit their request, along with all required supporting documentation, by early August. While this is not a deadline, and requests submitted later will still be considered, this will help avoid student account interest accumulating.
### Attention International Students:
Only U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are eligible for federal, state and institutional financial aid programs may submit Special and Unusual Circumstance requests. International graduate students experiencing changes in their financial circumstances may check with their department to learn about scholarships or fellowships for which they may be eligible.

## Decision & Notification
Decisions are determined by the Student Financial Aid Office. Generally, students need to submit their initial financial aid materials and any requested documents to receive an initial financial aid offer before submitting the request forms. Students are typically contacted via email within two to three weeks of submitting their request. 
It is important to note that while all Special Financial Circumstances are reviewed, not all requests result in a change to a student’s financial aid offer. The following instances generally have no or minimal impact on financial aid eligibility: 
  * An existing SAI that is low or below zero
  * Unallowable additional expenses (living expenses due to lifestyle choices, animal care/vet bills, employment-related expenses, credit card bills, home mortgages, school loan payments, car payments, etc.)


## Unusual Circumstances
## Overview & Eligibility
For those selected for federal verification by a federal processor or Carnegie Mellon, we may review and potentially change your dependency status without first completing federal verification requirements; however, verification may still need to be completed under independent student requirements.
The Student Financial Aid Office will presume any student who received a dependency override in a preceding award year to be independent for each subsequent award year while at Carnegie Mellon unless the student informs the institution that their circumstances have changed or the institution has conflicting information about the student's independence.
Examples of Unusual Circumstances related to dependency status include: 
  * Students in foster care or students who are not in the custody of a parent or guardian and are homeless or at risk of homelessness. If you have questions, please contact Director of Financial Aid Matt Metz or Senior Associate Director of Financial Aid Elaine Taillon.
  * Students who are at risk related to human trafficking, abusive family environment, legally granted refuge or asylum status, parental abandonment or estrangement, or student or parent incarceration. 


The following situations alone do not qualify
  * Parent(s) refusing to contribute to the student's education*
  * Parent(s) are unwilling to provide information on the FAFSA or for verification*
  * Parent(s) not claiming students as dependent for income tax purposes
  * Student demonstrates total self-sufficiency
  * Student does not live with their parent(s) 


_*Although these students are not eligible for a change in dependency status, they may be able to receive dependent level unsubsidized direct loans. A signed statement from the parent(s) that they do not and will not provide any financial support, or third-party documentation from a reliable source such as a teacher, counselor, cleric, or court is required. A signed statement from the student is not sufficient._

Generally, acceptable documentation can be a signed letter or an official document, such as a court order, and must support the student's reason for requesting a dependency status change from a dependent to an independent student.

  * member of the clergy,
  * prison administrator, or
  * government agency or court.
