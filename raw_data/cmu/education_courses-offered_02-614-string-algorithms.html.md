### Learning Objectives
  * Learn various algorithmic techniques and data structures for efficient processing of string data, including suffix trees,
  * suffix arrays, Borrows-Wheeler transforms.• Understand the why these algorithms and data structures work.
  * Learn to apply and extend these algorithms and data  
structures.
  * Learn about the practical application of these techniques,  
especially in genomics
  * At the end of this class, you should be familiar with much of the state-of-the-art in algorithms for strings, have familiarity with their use in practice, and have experience applying them to new problems.
