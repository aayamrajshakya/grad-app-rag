## Makers and thinkers, hackers and scholars, researchers and programmers—find your spark of genius at the INI.
The [Information Networking Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/index.html) offers two degrees through bicoastal delivery in collaboration with the CMU Silicon Valley location: the [Master of Science in Mobile and IoT Engineering (MSMITE)](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/index.html) and the [Master of Science in Information Technology - Information Security (MSIT-IS)](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/index.html). Students in the INI’s bicoastal mobility and information security programs divide their studies between Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh and Silicon Valley locations. Combining the rich, academic setting of the main campus with hands-on industry experience in the heart of Silicon Valley, bicoastal students have the best of both worlds.
Bicoastal students gain hands-on, industry exposure through the [practicum](https://www.cmu.edu/ini/academics/bicoastal/practicum.html%20). Working alongside project sponsors, bicoastal information security and mobility student teams at CMU-SV tackle problems, pilot new ideas and develop solutions in a semester-long project. Projects span a variety of topics in computing, mobile systems and security, and range from fundamental research to software development. 
## INI Celebrates 25 Years of world-class education in networking, security, and mobility.
## Master of Science in Mobile and IoT Engineering (MSMITE)
The INI’s bicoastal MSMITE degree prepares students to be at the forefront of the mobile and IoT engineering field, with a multidisciplinary curriculum spanning both technical and business topics in mobile applications, devices, services and networks. 
Program Learning Outcomes:
  * Demonstrate knowledge and skills regarding processing on constrained hardware, designing software for embedded computing, application delivery, and user interactions
  * Critically analyze historical and state-of-the-art mobile and IoT technologies relating to devices, networks, providers, data, and applications to identify trade-offs and develop design principles
  * Apply mobile and embedded system skills and principles toward the design and development of products and services across a variety of vertical markets
  * Evaluate trade-offs between technology solutions and potential business and economic impacts that influence or are influenced by mobile and IoT systems
  * Demonstrate the ability to scope, formalize, and execute practical team projects

* CMU INI Students Place Second in Silicon Valley Hackathon. For their entry, the four INI students designed a “wallet-less” shopping application that would allow customers to make purchases simply by having their picture taken at checkout. A merchant would use the application to identify the items in a shopping cart, calculate the amount due and then take the shopper’s picture. On the back end, the application would identify the shopper with the photo and connect to his or her PayPal account for payment. The shopper would also enter a PIN for additional security.
* Innovate in the Wild: Practicum Projects. Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) innovations like the Amazon Echo, his team of fellow Information Networking Institute (INI) students sought to optimize energy consumption on the modern electric grid in the project-based capstone course known as the practicum
* INI soars to grand prize win at Emirates Travel Hackathon. Over a 24-hour period, Runway at Twitter’s headquarters was abuzz with caffeinated minds as 294 talented hackers worked to redefine the online travel experience. The grand prize trip to Dubai went to CMWe, composed of three Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) INI students and two CMU Language Technology Institute (LTI) alumni, while fellow Carnegie Mellon teams Dream Hackers and Team Monopoly received API prizes from event partners.
## Master of Science in Information Technology - Information Security (MSIT-IS)
The INI’s bicoastal MSIT-IS degree prepares students to be the movers and shakers of the tech industry through a in security and privacy for information systems. 
Program Learning Outcomes:
  * Demonstrate knowledge and skills related to security and privacy principles and state-of-the-art techniques for security and privacy in information systems including devices, networks, software, and services
  * Evaluate trade-offs between technical security and privacy solutions and potential business and economic impacts
  * Design and implement secure systems and services by applying knowledge and skills in information security and privacy
  * Demonstrate the ability to scope, formalize, and execute practical team projects
