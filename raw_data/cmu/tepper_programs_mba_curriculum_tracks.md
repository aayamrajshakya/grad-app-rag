# Tracks
Tracks provide our MBA students with an opportunity for in-depth study in a particular field or career.
Tracks typically consist of 8-10 electives and a related capstone course and offer the opportunity to develop expertise in one of five forward-looking areas of business specialization. Some tracks involve cross-campus collaboration with faculty and other graduate students. Enrolling in a track is optional.
