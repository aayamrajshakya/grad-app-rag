# Accounting Mini Conference
## About The Conference
The accounting mini-conference at the Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon started in the year 2000 under the leadership of Professors Yuji Ijiri, Shyam Sunder, and Jon Glover, when the school was under its original name of Graduate School of Industrial Administration (GSIA). Since its early days the conference has focused on foundational aspects of accounting thoughts through an interdisciplinary research lens. Over the years, the work presented and discussed at the conference encompassed ideas from accounting, finance, economics, ethics, physics, computer science, among others. Specific themes of the conference included The intellectual foundation of accounting in 2001, Celebrating Scholarly Excellence of Professor Yuji Ijiri in 2018, and Accounting Structure and Information: Celebrating the Centennial of “An Historical Defense of Bookkeeping
