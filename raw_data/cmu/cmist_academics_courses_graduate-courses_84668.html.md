# Technology Ethics
## Course Number: 84-668 
Churchill once complained that war, once "cruel and magnificent," had been "completely spoiled" due to the involvement of scientists in creating new military weaponry. Scientific-military collaborations are hardly new, however. This course provides an introduction to the politics of technology ethics. The purpose of this course is not to instruct on what is or should be considered ethical. Rather, our aim will be to understand how ethical standpoints intersect with the political realm, creating tradeoffs for individuals and societies. Delving into historical technological controversies, we will debate current issues like the precautionary principle, technology neutrality, and individual responsibility.
