##  Taxation
Generally, employer-provided graduate tuition benefits over $5,250 per year are subject to federal taxes. However, if your education is directly related to your CMU job, you may be able to exclude the cost from your taxable income. To do this, you'll need to certify that your education meets IRS requirements. If approved, the value of your CMU job-related coursework will not be included in your federal income tax. See the [Taxation and Tuition Benefits page](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/benefits/tuition/taxation.html) for details.
