## Education
I received my Ph.D. in Health Economics and Policy from Emory University. Previously, Johns Hopkins and Rice University trained.
## Research
My interests lie at the intersection of decision theory and health policy. I am particularly interested in how physicians make decisions, the effects of organizational and policy environments on such decisions, and its implications for patient welfare.
