# Please Note:
  * The spring 2026 estimated cost of health insurance runs from January 1, 2026, to July 31, 2026. Students who graduate in fall 2026 may keep coverage until July 31, 2027, or apply for a pro-rata refund, which may not be available if significant claims have been paid as determined by the Student Health Services Office. [Visit the University Health Services site](https://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/index.html) for more information.
  * A laptop computer with an additional estimated cost of $1,500 is required. Students may make a one-time request to borrow up to $1,500 to cover the documented purchase of a laptop computer for school use.
  * Tuition, university fees, and health insurance are charged to your student account. You have the option of opting out of the health insurance cost if you have existing coverage.
  * Students may choose to borrow for non-tuition costs like room and board, even though these costs are not charged to the student account. 
  * Cost of Attendance projections are Pittsburgh based. Estimates such as housing and food will not reflect the actual costs for students who opt to live in other cities during summer internships.
