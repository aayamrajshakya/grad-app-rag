# MS student courses in biological sciences
This page includes the most common courses for MS students in Biological Sciences. These courses serve students in the [MSCB](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/curriculum/index.html), [MSBTPE](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-biotech-pharma/curriculum/index.html), and [MSQBB](https://www.cmu.edu/bio/graduate/ms_quant_bioinformatics/curriculum/index.html) programs. They are open to other programs as space permits. The links in the previous sentence to the programs explain the curriculum for each program. NOTE that this page includes courses that are core and/or elective courses; some courses are core requirements in one program but also serve as electives in other programs or vice versa. To see how each course fits into your program's curriculum, review the links above.
