#  Lee Vinsel, Ph.D., 2011 
February 28, 2017
After completing his PhD at Carnegie Mellon, Lee did a postdoctoral year at Harvard University before working for five years as an assistant professor at Stevens Institute of Technology. Vinsel’s early research focused on the relationship between government, business, and technological change. His dissertation and forthcoming book, Moving Violations: Automobiles, Experts, and Regulations in the United States
He began this research as part of an interdisciplinary climate policy group housed in Carnegie Mellon’s Department of Engineering and Public Policy. The question that motivated this research was, “What can contemporary climate policy makers learn from the US government’s past attempts to curb technological risks like automobile accidents and air pollution?” One of the key findings of this research is that—while many people claim that government regulations hinder technological innovation—the opposite is often true in certain contexts: regulations can induce innovation by getting corporations to work on problems that they are otherwise ignoring. Put another way, government regulation is often the best tool we have for generating socially-beneficial technological change.
