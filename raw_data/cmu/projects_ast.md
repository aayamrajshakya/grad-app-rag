# Algebraic Set Theory
Algebraic set theory uses the methods of category theory to study elementary set theory. The purpose of this website is to link together current research in algebraic set theory and make it easily available. It is hoped that this will encourage and facilitate further development of the subject. 
[Why do you call it "algebraic set theory"?](https://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/ast/whyast.html)

## Bibliography
The following is a brief survey of the current literature on algebraic set theory. The bibliography is ordered chronologically by year of publication and then alphabetically by the author's surname (by the first author's surname in the case of works with multiple authors). Draft and preprint versions of papers are listed as they become available. Upon publication preprints are removed and papers are listed under year of publication. In most cases preprints are still available on individual author homepages or on the arXiv.  
The ordering of papers below does not, in all cases, do full justice to the historical development of the subject due, among other things, to the delay between completion of a paper and its subsequent publication. Forthcoming annotations will provide additional details regarding the historical development of the research listed below. If there is anything you feel that we have left out, then please feel free to contact us.
