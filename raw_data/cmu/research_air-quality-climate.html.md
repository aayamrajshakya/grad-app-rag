# Air quality and climate
The Earth's atmosphere is a giant and complex chemical reactor. We strive to quantify how the atmosphere is changing due to human activity and to predict how these changes will affect the environment and society.
We study the multitude of physical and chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere, with a focus on particulate matter. Students in our research groups:
  * design and build sensitive instrumentation
  * run laboratory experiments mimicking the atmosphere
  * run regional and global climate models
  * use observations collected from diverse locations around the planet and from satellites orbiting Earth


## Sample research projects
* ### Dominic Casalnuovo
My research focuses on determining how sulfuric acid forms particles in the upper boundary layer. I am developing a novel, compact, battery-operated instrument to measure atmospheric sulfuric acid vapor where clouds form in the atmosphere. My goal is to use these measurements to help reduce the uncertainty in how aerosols influence climate in global Earth-system models.

* ### Eric Giuffrida
My research involves simulating smoke episodes over the Southeast Atlantic Ocean using a climate model to disentangle and quantify radiative effects associated with smoke aerosol-cloud interactions. Aerosol-cloud interactions represent one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate models today. I am further exploring and quantifying structural uncertainties inherent to the model and uncertainties associated with how radiative effects are calculated.

* ### Christine Troller
My research bridges knowledge gaps between microalgae emissions, atmospheric nucleation reactions, cloud formation, and climate change. I also have been investigating potential inhalation hazards from emissions produced by freshwater harmful algae blooms in the local Pennsylvania region.

* ### Victor Alejandro Sanchez
I conduct uncertainty quantification to study the radiative effects of aerosols released into the atmosphere by biomass burning in Southern Africa. My work involves developing machine learning-based emulators for a climate model, which I use to evaluate parametric uncertainties within the model. My future research will extend to analyzing aerosol-cloud interactions in Southern Ocean cyclones.
