## Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA)

At the time of admission, Carnegie Mellon may request documentation to confirm DACA status in order to process financial aid accordingly, but documentation is not required when submitting an application. At this time, undocumented students without DACA status are not eligible to apply for financial aid.
