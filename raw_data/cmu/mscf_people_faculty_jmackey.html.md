## Bio
John Mackey is a teaching professor, jointly appointed in mathematics and computer science. For research, I like to hunt for elusive mathematical objects having special properties. For example, assuming that every pair of people are either acquaintances or strangers, it is not known whether it is possible to have a party of 43 people at which no five people are mutual acquaintances and no five people are mutual strangers. Such questions test the boundary of mathematics and computation.
My primary activities in the departments are teaching, serving on curriculum and education committees, mentoring various clubs and campus groups, and hosting prospective students and their parents. I was a co-PI on the recent NSF Debt-M grant to help Pittsburgh Public School Students close the opportunity gap faced in their pursuit of mathematics.
