## Bio
Hi, I'm Milton! I'm pursuing an M.S. in Computational Finance at CMU, building on my undergraduate degree in pure mathematics at UCL. I made this transition because I wanted to apply rigorous analytical skills to real-world problems—and quantitative finance is the natural arena where my strengths in mathematics, programming, and decision-making come together.  
  
At the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, I analyzed derivatives and order book data to uncover patterns in liquidity and volatility, sharpening my ability to turn complex datasets into actionable trading insights. I also gained experience in predictive modeling at a FinTech startup and financial strategy at a Fortune 500 energy firm, building a well-rounded perspective on markets. Besides this, I also compete in international bowling tournaments, where thriving under pressure, precision, and focus in fast-paced tournaments mirror the qualities I bring to the industry.  
  
I am seeking opportunities in quantitative trading and research, where I can combine statistical rigor with composure under pressure to build and execute strategies in dynamic markets.
