#  Diplomacy, International Development, and Foreign Policy[](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/students-recent-graduates/)
Considering a career overseas, perhaps as an ambassador or foreign service officer? Interested in learning how US foreign aid is used or how to make aid more effective? Want to work toward the eradication of poverty, improved access to education, or improvement of health systems in developing countries? An internship with an international development, diplomacy, or foreign policy organization might be a good fit!
The organizations below deal primarily with international issues. At a diplomacy-focused organization, interns will help with research, event planning, and a variety of office functions in support of work that contributes to peaceful relations and dialogue between countries. Experts at these organizations tend to be retired ambassadors, diplomats representing their countries in DC, and international scholars. Foreign-policy organizations focus on research and dissemination of information important to international relations and policy-making. Interns at an international development organization can expect to assist with the management of overseas projects, including communications and reporting, as well as business development, such as writing proposals for funding.
If you’re interested in these topics from a government perspective, you should also check out the federal internships page to explore an internship with the US State Department or US Agency for International Development. If you’d prefer to support research on these topics, you should also consider an internship at a think tank.
