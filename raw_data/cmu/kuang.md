### Welcome
Welcome to the Kuang Lab home page! We are in the Department of Biological Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University at Pittsburgh. Our lab is broadly interested in understanding how intestinal bacteria regulate mammalian metabolism and immunity. We use a mix of techniques including genomics, gnotobiotics, laser capture microscopy to determine the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate host-microbial interactions. Our long-term goal is to identify new avenues for developing therapeutics against metabolic and immunological diseases.
If you are passionate about using multidisciplinary techniques to study host-microbial interactions, join us! We are recruiting lab members at all levels. Apply [here](https://labs.bio.cmu.edu/kuang/join/).
