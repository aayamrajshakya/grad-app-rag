## Bio
Florence (Siyi) Liu graduated in May 2025 from Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business with a degree in Business Administration and Statistics. Before joining MSCF, she had experience on both sell-side trading at Citigroup and buy-side trading at an asset management firm, and she discovered her love for the thrill of the markets. During her undergrad studies, she served as a mentor in the Tepper finance group Sales and Trading Academy to guide lower-classmen to discover areas in trading. Florence is eager to leverage her statistical modeling, Python automation, and structured-credit experience into a dynamic career as a quantitative trader.
