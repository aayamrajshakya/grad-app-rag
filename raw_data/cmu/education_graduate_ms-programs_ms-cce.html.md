The M.S. in Civil & Computer Engineering combines the expertise of CMU’s Departments of [Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE)](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/) and Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) into one program. This interdisciplinary degree offers the opportunity for students to learn increasingly sought-after skills like designing, implementing, and managing smart infrastructure systems.   
  
As the built environment becomes more connected, intelligent infrastructure systems collect data through sensors and advanced technologies, enabling more efficient, sustainable, and resilient systems. This joint degree program emphasizes not only the underlying technology and theory supporting these systems, but also the broader applicability and integration of control within the built and natural environments. Through that, it opens a wide range of possible areas that students can work at and make a positive impact.  
  
By enrolling in this program, students will gain hands-on experience in the design and control of critical systems, such as mobility, energy, and water infrastructure, while addressing emerging threats and challenges like cyberattacks, extreme weather events, and urbanization. With courses in sensing, modeling, and control systems across multiple departments, students will graduate ready to lead in the development of safe, resilient, and human-centric systems.
