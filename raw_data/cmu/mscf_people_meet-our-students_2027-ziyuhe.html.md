## Bio
Ziyu (Peter) graduated from Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Financial Mathematics. He also earned a Bachelor's degree in Finance from the University of Delaware through a joint program. During his undergraduate studies, he earned the National Scholarship of China (Top 1%) and completed an exchange semester at UC Berkeley, focusing on mathematics and technical studies with a perfect GPA.  
Ziyu brings extensive quantitative research experience from multiple internships, where he developed solid programming and machine learning skills. During his internship at CICC, he built a neural network model producing robust alpha based on limit order book data. Additionally, he enhanced a GRU model to improve mid-price prediction capabilities, which achieved higher IC.  
What sets Ziyu apart is his unique combination of technical expertise and proven resilience. His decade-long soccer career, despite three major injuries, demonstrates his unwavering determination and ability to overcome challenges.  
Ziyu joined the MSCF program to further sharpen his technical skills and expand his network in quantitative finance. He aspires to pursue a career in quantitative research or quantitative trading.
