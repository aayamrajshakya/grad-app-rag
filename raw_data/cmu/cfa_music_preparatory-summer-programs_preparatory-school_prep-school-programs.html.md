Piano Program  
Luz Manriquez, Director
Our Piano Program, designed by Professor Hanna Wu Li and directed by Luz Manriquez, combines outstanding private piano instruction with classes in Dalcroze Eurhythmics, music theory, composition, improvisation, and chamber music. A public, free recital is given at the end of each semester. Each year many students receive national recognition for excellence. 
Private Piano Lessons:
Beginning Piano Program for Children  
Carla LaRocca, Director 
Overview
The Beginning Piano Program for Children is designed to provide students ages 5 through 7 with a comprehensive instruction plan focusing on a natural approach to the keyboard and developing fluency in reading and musicianship. The students receive a 45-minute group class, a 30-minute private lesson, and a 45-minute Dalcroze Eurhythmics class every week. The group class concentrates on topics such as note reading, counting, rhythm, ear training, sight reading, solo ad duet playing, and technical concepts such as finger patterns and hand positions. During the weekly private lesson, students will receive more individualized coaching to develop further the concepts addressed in the group class. Based on the principles of Emile Jacques-Dalcroze, the Eurhythmics class helps the students experience music through their bodies by integrating movement, ear training, and improvisation. 
Program Expectations
This Program is specifically for students ages 5 through 7 (though students who will be turning 5 during the first year of instruction and are therefore 4 at the time of interview may be considered). Students must be able to commit to **four consecutive semesters** of instruction (including summers, as applicable). Students will have classes at the same time all four semesters. the end of the following the end of the following
Interviews
All students wishing to enroll in the Beginning Piano Program for Children must first complete an interview with the Director of the Program, Professor Carla LaRocca. The interview is about 15 minutes long, and students do not need to prepare anything, as no experience is necessary to enter the Beginning Piano Program for Children. During the interview, the child will be asked to do simple activities like clapping and singing. The child’s attention span, emotional maturity, concentration ability, and manners will be assessed. Interviews are conducted throughout the year and typically are for consideration for the following semester at the time of the meeting (for example, if a student interviews duringwill not
Decisions
Regardless of when a child has an interview, decisions are only sent out during regular Prep School registration periods (late July/early August for Fall; November for Spring; late March/early April for Summer). The following factors are considered when determining whether or not a child is accepted into the class:
  * Class size – Each Beginning Piano class has a maximum size of 12. This is to make the Program as individualized as possible.
  * Age makeup – So that all students in the class can thrive, we try to compose a class where all of the students are as close in age as possible.
  * All of the factors considered at the time of the interview (i.e., child’s attention span, maturity, etc.)


When the incoming Beginning Piano class has been determined, the parents of all of the students who have recently interviewed will receive a decision via e-mail on whether their child was accepted, deferred, or waitlisted:
  * Accepted – Your child was accepted into the incoming Beginning Piano class
  * Deferred – At the time of your child’s interview, it was determined that they are ready to begin the Beginning Piano class and were in high contention to do so, but a spot was not available. If they are deferred, this means they are eligible for one of two possibilities: 
    * If a student accepted into the Program declines their offer, your child will receive priority for filling that spot.
    * If there are no remaining spots in the upcoming semester, your child will receive priority for enrollment in the following semester.
  * Second interview Needed – Your child was not accepted into the upcoming semester but can be considered for future semesters as long as they complete a second interview.


Cost
The Beginning Piano for Program for Children carries a tuition fee of $1000 per semester. This fee covers each Program’s components— a weekly 45-minute group class, a 45-minute Daclroze Eurhythmics class, a 30-minute private lesson—and all books and materials. Payment is due at the beginning of each semester.
## String Program
The Carnegie Mellon String Preparatory School offers a comprehensive program for students ages 6-18 years of age. Students may enroll in private violin, viola, cello, and double bass lessons. We offer a full curriculum of classes, including Group Classes, Eurhythmics, Music Theory, Composition, and Chamber Music. Each year comprises three semesters, Fall, Spring & Summer, with recitals ending the Fall and Spring semesters.   
  
In the summer, string students are encouraged to attend the Carnegie Mellon Summer String Workshop. The Summer String Workshop, sponsored by the CMU String Preparatory School, is a 5-day program that brings string students from the greater Pittsburgh area together for an inspiring week of solo and ensemble playing.
Private String Instruction  
Students sign up for a weekly private lesson. Lesson duration is based on the student's level of experience. Private lessons are taught on Saturdays or weekdays.
In addition to a weekly lesson, students are encouraged to take music classes offered at the Carnegie Mellon campus on Saturdays: Group Classes for violin, viola, or cello, Eurhythmics, Musicianship, Theory, Composition, or Chamber Music. These classes help to develop ensemble playing, listening skills, rhythmic and tonal dictation, theoretical knowledge, and structural and compositional techniques.
Group classes are fundamental to developing students’ proficiency in ensemble playing and note reading, rhythm, counting, and sight reading. We highly recommend elementary level students enroll in the weekly class. Group classes are based on student enrollment.
