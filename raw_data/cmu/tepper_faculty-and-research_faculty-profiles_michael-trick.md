Carnegie Mellon University  
  

Appointed in 2017, Dr. Trick has led the campus through a period of significant growth and development. He was instrumental in establishing an exceptional financial aid framework for students, leading to a fivefold increase in applications and a 40% increase in the student population. Under his leadership, CMU-Q has expanded its research activity, course offerings, and launched the first Bachelor of Science degree in Artificial Intelligence in Qatar.  
  
Dr. Trick is also a recognized leader within the broader Education City ecosystem. He is a vocal champion for the multiversity experience, working collaboratively with other partner universities on initiatives that benefit all students. Notably, he was instrumental in establishing an Education City-wide new student orientation, and aligning general education offerings and normalizing academic calendars and daily schedules to facilitate cross-registration and shared student experiences.  
  
Dr. Trick joined the Carnegie Mellon faculty in 1989 after earning his Ph.D. in industrial engineering at Georgia Tech. A distinguished researcher and educator in the field of operations research, he holds the Harry B. and James H. Higgins Professor of Operations Research chair, an appointment he received in 2012.  
  
During his academic career, Dr. Trick has served in many leadership roles. At CMU’s Tepper School of Business, he has served as associate dean of research, senior associate dean of education, and senior associate dean of faculty and research. He was president of the Carnegie Bosch Institute for Applied Studies in International Management from 1998 to 2005, during which time he was named the inaugural Bosch Professor.  
  
Dr. Trick is a prominent figure in the international operations research community. He is a fellow of both INFORMS (the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences) and IFORS (the International Federation of Operational Research Societies), and served as president of both organizations. He has authored more than fifty professional publications, edited six volumes of refereed articles, and consulted extensively with organizations such as the United States Postal Service, Major League Baseball, and various college basketball conferences.  
  
In both academia and research, Dr. Trick has been recognized for his significant contributions. He is a two-time recipient of the George Leland Bach Award for teaching excellence in the Tepper School’s MBA program. He was part of the U.S. Federal Communication Commission (FCC) team that won the prestigious Franz Edelman Award for their revolutionary, market-based approach to reallocating the wireless communication spectrum.  
  
In 2024, he received the INFORMS Journal of Computing Test of Time Award for landmark research papers in operations research and computing that continue to influence the field, decades after they were first published.
