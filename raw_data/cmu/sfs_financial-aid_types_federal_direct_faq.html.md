# Federal Direct Loan FAQs
## What types of Federal Direct Student Loans are available?
The Federal Direct Student Loan program offers subsidized and unsubsidized loans to students, as well as Parent PLUS Loans to parents and Grad PLUS Loans to graduate students. Please note that graduate students are not eligible to receive Direct Subsidized Loans.
## Do I have to complete another Master Promissory Note if I previously borrowed a Federal Direct Student Loan?
If you previously borrowed a Federal Direct Student Loan, you do not need to complete another MPN for each subsequent academic year.
If you are a first-time borrower, you must sign a Federal Direct Loan Master Promissory Note (MPN) and Federal Entrance Counseling. You will need to have your FSA ID, which you used to complete your FAFSA in order to electronically sign the MPN. The MPN can be completed at <https://studentaid.gov/mpn/>. See additional [instructions](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/direct/mpn-entrance-counseling.html).
## What are the current interest rates and fees charged in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program?
View information about [interest rates](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/direct/index.html). 
## How do I apply for a Federal Direct Parent PLUS/Grad PLUS Loan?
If you or your parents are planning to borrow a PLUS Loan for the first time, please wait until you have received your financial aid offer to complete this application process. The award letter will be necessary to help you determine the amount you need to request. Families should not apply for a PLUS Loan earlier than June 1 since the PLUS Loan requires a credit approval which is only valid for 90 days. View more information about [PLUS Loans](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/plus/index.html).
## What is the grace period through the Direct Loan program?
Repayment begins after your one-time grace period six months after you graduate from your degree program or are not enrolled at least half-time.
## Do Direct Loans allow borrowers to defer payment?
Yes. The maximum period for which a borrower may receive a deferment is determined in accordance with the Direct Loan Program regulations, and depends on the deferment type. View information about deferments at [www.studentaid.gov](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/deferment-forbearance).
## How do I decline a Federal Direct Student Loan?
Unless we hear from you directly, we will assume that you are interested in borrowing the amount of the direct loan listed on your financial aid award letter and we will originate the loan. If you would like to cancel all or a portion of your federal loan, please complete a [Loan Adustment (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/docs/loan-adjust.pdf) form or contact The HUB. 
## Where can I find information regarding to whom I will be repaying my other federal loans?
Information on your federal loan debt can be accessed via the [National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)](https://nslds.ed.gov). Note that any private loans you have borrowed will not appear in the NSLDS.
