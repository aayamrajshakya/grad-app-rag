# Information and communication technology
We study policy challenges posed by advanced telecommunications and information technologies. How should the Internet and other telecommunications services be regulated? How should spectrum be managed? What policies and technologies are needed to protect privacy and strengthen cybersecurity? What are the policy implications of artificial intelligence, non-geosynchronous satellites, and cryptocurrencies?
