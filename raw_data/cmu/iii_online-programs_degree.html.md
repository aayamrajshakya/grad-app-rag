## Capstone Course Description
## 49-608, Professional Practice of Product Innovation
The capstone course focuses on a team-based product innovation process that integrates engineering, business, and design disciplines, focusing not solely on the tasks but also on the professionalism that is important for working on future projects in which there would be a client. The course consists of four phases including identifying, understanding, conceptualizing, and introducing a product opportunity. Students learn methods to research the needs, wants, and desires of a market opportunity, define product specifications, conceptualize products to meet the users' needs and desires, and refine the most promising concept. Students will hone their skills in formulating a hypothesis, supporting it with evidence, and logically presenting their conclusions. The project will result in a resolved form, functional design, and marketing plan. That said, the goal is not only to "build gears" or "write code" or "develop a business plan," but rather for students to develop a deeper understanding of how those methods can impact the success of innovation projects, developing their ability to critically assess how theoretical methods and principles impact a practical innovation challenge. The capstone course also emphasizes communication of the project through multiple presentations and reports.
