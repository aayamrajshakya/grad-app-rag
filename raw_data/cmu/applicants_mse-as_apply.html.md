# Apply Now
All aspects of the candidate's packet are given equal weight and consideration. No single admission criterion overshadows another; rather, it is the composite of all of the application materials that determines the admission decision. The ability to perform graduate-level work, a solid undergraduate background in computer science or related disciplines, software development maturity, and industry experience are several factors considered for admission. In some cases, excellence and promise can balance a lack of formal preparation.

We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.   
  
Submit valid, recent scores  

     * If you have not received a bachelor’s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit an English proficiency score no older than two years. (Scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2023, will not be accepted.)
     * If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (Scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2020, will not be accepted.)

# FAQs
##### Should I send official transcripts and score reports? 
If accepted into the program, you will receive instructions for submitting official transcripts and test scores (if applicable). Please note that official documents cannot be tracked or accepted during the initial application process. You only need to provide official transcripts and test scores after being admitted to the program and receiving instructions.
#####  How do I calculate my years of experience? 
The cutoff date to use in your calculation is December 2025 which is the month in which this application is due. For example, if you started working at a company in March 2022 and you currently work there and intend to continue working there until August 2026, you would calculate the start date as March 2022 and the end date as December 2025. You would report on the application that you worked at the company for 3 years, 9 months.
#####  Should I include internships in my years of experience calculation? 
It is reasonable to include software engineering internships in your calculation as long as the internship was with a legitimate company and led to an increase of knowledge in software engineering.
#####  Is there an application fee? 
Yes, the application fee is $100.
##### Is it possible to take courses without being admitted to a program?
Non-degree seeking students may take a maximum of 36 units (three full-semester courses). To continue taking courses beyond the 36 unit limit, the non-degree student must formally apply and be admitted to one of the graduate software engineering programs.
##### Is it possible to get an MSE degree online?
Yes. You can find information about the MSE Online program and application requirements in the MSE Online section of the website.
