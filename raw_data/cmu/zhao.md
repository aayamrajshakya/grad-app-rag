[Just announced!](https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/news-events/2019/0613_expansion-microscopy-vr.html) Our lab, through a grant from the Gates Foundation, is collaborating with Benaroya Research Institute and Immersive Science to combine expansion microscopy and virtual reality software to study infectious disease. The intuitive nature of viewing data in three dimensions will accelerate researchers’ understanding of infectious and autoimmune diseases and enhance their ability to develop disease diagnostics and prevention and treatment methods.

Our group size doubles! Welcome to Brendan Gallagher, ZhangYu (Sharey) Cheng, Yuhong (James) Wang, and Christopher Ahn!  
Brendan and Sharey are from the Department of Biological Sciences at CMU. Brendan will work on nanoscale imaging of neuronal systems, and Sharey will explore new ways to see microbes and infected tissues.  
James is in the UPitt-CMU Molecular Biophysics & Structural Biology Program. James will try to teach viral proteins some new tricks.
