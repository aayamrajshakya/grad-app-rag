Ph.D., Cornell University
#  Research 
My current research is in combinatorial optimization and graph theory, with emphasis on the algorithmic aspects. My current focus is on the study of perfect graphs, balanced matrices and the max-flow min-cut property. Another line of my research deals with NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems through the study of relaxations. Using polyhedral combinatorics, contributions are made to the theory of the set covering, location, vehicle routing, and traveling salesman problems.
