# Energy Master's Degrees
EST&P is a professional engineering master’s program oriented towards career preparation of individuals who have a passion for leading society’s energy future. Each of the EST&P program's six energy master's degrees [energy core ](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/energy-core/index.html "energy core")courses that are the foundation of the EST&P program, and an[engineering concentration](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/engineering-concentrations/index.html "EST&P Disciplinary Concentrations"), in which you select among pre-approved energy courses offered by one of the six College of Engineering departments that are partners with the EST&P program. Further customization is achieved through the many courses and curricular paths available, including a large range of individual energy-related courses and projects at CMU available as[breadth electives](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/breadth-electives.html "Breadth elective courses"), as well as four degree variants, including[advanced study](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/advanced-study.html) and[applied study](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/applied-study.html).
The two Foundational Energy Master's Degrees
  * The Energy Science, Technology and Policy (EST&P) Two semesters96 units
  * The Energy Science, Technology and Policy - Advanced Study (EST&P-ADS) degree integrates Advanced Study (36 units of an Advanced Study Concentration) with the base EST&P degree. Three semesters of full-time study are required for completion of 120 units of qualifying coursework.
