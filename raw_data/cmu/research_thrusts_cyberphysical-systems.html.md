Cyberphysical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that link sensing, computation, and control to the physical world. As more devices are embedded with sensors that communicate with smartphones and servers, we increase the capacity to sense our surroundings and control how technology affects our lives. If orchestrated correctly, CPS's economic and societal potential will transform broad domains such as transportation, critical infrastructure monitoring, healthcare, defense systems, manufacturing, smart buildings, and citywide energy optimization.
Designing cyberphysical systems requires research in multiple areas in which the college excels—embedded systems, control theory, sensors, perception, computer networks, and machine learning.
