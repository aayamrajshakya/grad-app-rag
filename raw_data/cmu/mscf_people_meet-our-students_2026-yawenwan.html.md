## Bio
I am an incoming Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Computational Finance. I hold a Bachelor’s degree from NYU, where I double-majored in Mathematics and Economics and minored in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I have had the privilege of engaging in research projects under esteemed professors and collaborating with diverse cultural groups. My undergraduate studies were complemented by three internships where I cultivated my interest in quantitative finance, focusing on quantitative research, portfolio management, and data science. I am eager to connect with like-minded professionals and peers who share my passion for finance and technology. Feel free to directly message me or email me at yawenwan@andrew.cmu.edu. Let’s explore potential synergies!
