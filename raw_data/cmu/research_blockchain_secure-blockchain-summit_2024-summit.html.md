## About
Despite advances, many research questions still need to be answered to ensure blockchain protocols and applications are ready for widespread use. As the industry continues to see more consumer applications, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), securing the fundamental research elements of the technology, especially from a security, privacy, ethics, and societal impact perspective, is of utmost importance.
Now in its second year, Carnegie Mellon University’s Secure Blockchain Summit will convene leading researchers and experts from across academia and industry to discuss the future of blockchain research, technology, and applications, focusing on a variety of topics, including crypto-economics, applied cryptography, programming languages, security and privacy, policy and usability, ethics, and equity.
