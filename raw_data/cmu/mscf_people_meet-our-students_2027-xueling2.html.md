## Bio
Hi! I am a current Master of Science in Computational Finance (MSCF) student at Carnegie Mellon University, holding a bachelor's degree in Financial Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have hands-on quant research experience from internships across equities, commodity futures, and convertible bonds, developing and backtesting algorithmic strategies. My interest in applying machine learning to finance was sparked and deepened through undergraduate research on adversarial image detection, where I improved model accuracy by over 15%. I am seeking a summer intern for 2026 and full-time opportunities in quantitative research and trading, and welcome any interested parties to reach out.
