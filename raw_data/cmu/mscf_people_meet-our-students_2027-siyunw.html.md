## Bio
I'm Siyun (Camellia) Wang, a detail-oriented and analytically driven thinker with a passion for uncovering structure in complexity. I graduated with University and College Honors from Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Statistics and Architecture, and am now pursuing my Master of Science in Computational Finance (MSCF).  
  
I bring hands-on experience in quantitative research and financial analysis. At Huaxi Futures, I applied Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to high-frequency energy futures data, extracting intraday signals. At Guotai Junan Securities, I conducted in-depth analysis of Chinese REITs using both market fundamentals and policy insights. These roles sharpened my skills in Python, machine learning, and econometrics-and deepened my interest in market microstructure and systematic trading.  
  
I seek to join a fast-paced, intellectually rigorous firm where I aim to build on my interdisciplinary skill set and apply data-driven methods to systematic trading and macro strategy. My background helps me see structure where others see noise-and I will bring that perspective to help your team innovate and execute faster.
