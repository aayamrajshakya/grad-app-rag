# Academic Advising
All ECE students are advised by both [faculty](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/advisors.html#Fac_Advisors) and [staff](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/advisors.html#Staff_Advisors) academic advisors, who provide support and guide them through their Carnegie Mellon experience.
Undergraduate first-year students are advised through the College of Engineering as part of the [First-Year Experience](https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/undergraduate-programs/student-life/first-year-experience.html), which starts the summer before students arrive on campus. 
Graduate and undergraduate students who have formally declared their major in electrical and computer engineering are assigned to faculty and staff academic advisors within the department. These advisors can assist students with course selection, help them prepare for internships and on-campus research, and provide them with information on degree requirements and progress.
Advisor information is provided below, and students can schedule appointments using the information listed under "Helpful Links." Availability is set on an individual basis, but students are welcome to visit the [Academic Services Center](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/academic-services-center.html) in HH 1113, open M–F 8:30am–5pm, for assistance in connecting with a member of the advising team.
[ECE peer advisors](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/insider/undergrads.html) are also available as a resource for undergraduate students!
