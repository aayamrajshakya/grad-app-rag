## Bio
Learning the intricacies of mathematics, statistics, programming, and game theory has always fascinated me. To me, markets are like a live puzzle, involving all four of these disciplines. That's why I'm drawn to the quant space, and why I aim to be part of an algorithmic trading desk where I can engage with that complexity every day.
