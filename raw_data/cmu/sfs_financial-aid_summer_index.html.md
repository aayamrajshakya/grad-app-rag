#  Summer Grant Options 
## Tartan Summer Grant
The Tartan Summer Grant program was established to assist Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students interested in taking summer coursework to stay on track for major requirements or on-time graduation, to proactively prepare for an upcoming semester, or for other academically driven reasons. Eligible students must have demonstrated financial need or extenuating circumstances. Grants will only be approved after eligible students registered for summer coursework.
Students who wish to be considered for a Tartan Summer Grant may submit an application through My Student Aid, under the My Forms section
#### Application for 2025 is closed
## PA Summer State Grants
Students may qualify for a PA Summer State Grant by completing an application at [www.pheaa.org](http://www.pheaa.org) by the August 15 deadline. The summer grant counts toward one of eight full-time semesters of state grant eligibility. Awards are determined by the Pennsylvania State Grant Program. To be eligible for a PA State Grant, students must:
  * Meet Pennsylvania residency requirements as defined by Pennsylvania State Grant Program, and
  * Be enrolled at least half-time (18 units) for the combination of all summer sessions.
  * Additional requirements are available on the [PA Summer State Grant Program](https://www.pheaa.org/grants/state-grant-program/summer-grant-program.shtml) website.

Federal Pell Grants are available for Carnegie Mellon undergraduate students enrolled in a degree-seeking program. To be eligible for a Summer Pell Grant, students must:
  * Have completed 2024-2025 or 2025-2026 FAFSA
  * Enroll in summer classes
  * Meet satisfactory academic progress standards for financial aid eligibility
  * Be eligible for the Federal Pell Grant

#  Summer Loan Options 
## Federal Direct Loan
Federal Direct Loans are available to eligible undergraduate and graduate students. There are two types of Federal Direct Loans: subsidized (for undergraduates only) and unsubsidized. Students interested in applying should submit a [Summer Loan Application (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/docs/summer-loan-app-2526.pdf). Eligibility will be determined once the application is received by The HUB and processed.
Students who choose to borrow a Federal Direct Loan for summer coursework should keep in mind that their loan eligibility may be reduced for the following academic year. First-time borrowers at Carnegie Mellon should contact their [HUB liaison](https://www.cmu.edu/hub/contact/liaisons.html) prior to applying for a summer loan. Students taking classes outside of CMU are required to submit a [Consortium Agreement (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/docs/consortium.pdf) and a letter from their academic department verifying that their units/credits will count toward their CMU degree.
## Private Loans
There are other loan options provided by private lenders that may provide supplementary funding for students during the summer. Private loans are not part of federal programs like Federal Direct Loans or PLUS Loans. They are loans provided by private lenders and institutions; therefore, loan terms and limits vary by program and lender. Private loans are based on creditworthiness and may require a co-signer.
