# Geopolitics of Innovation
## Course Number: 84-675 
If technology is applied knowledge, knowledge is power. This course explores how national power is derived from scientific and technological advancements, impacting the global geopolitical landscape. Students will be introduced to topics such as innovation theory, along with subsequent insights from economics, sociology, and political science, to understand the dynamics of technological progress in peacetime and wartime. We will examine what drives innovation in different countries, how nations cooperate or compete in scientific and technological fields, the impact of individuals and organizations on innovation, and the role of creativity. Additionally, the course will address the extent to which policymakers can influence and harness technological change---a vital question as the world enters a new era of technological competition.
