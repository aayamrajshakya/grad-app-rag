# Graduate Program Requirements
The basic graduate program for either Ph.D. consists of:
  * Relevant coursework in the areas of cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, social/health psychology to provide breadth in the areas of psychology best represented by our program.
  * Training in basic and advanced statistical and computational skills.
  * Teaching assistantships to provide trainees with mentored experiences in university-level instruction.
  * Professional development seminars to build professional skills and enable individualized pathway planning.
  * Training in the responsible conduct of research and reporting to train ethically responsible scientists who produce rigorous and reliable research.

## Overview of the Requirements by Year
## Year 1
  * The student takes an orientation course during the first week of the semester, one or two core courses in cognitive, developmental, or social/health psychology, and a statistics or methods course.
  * The student chooses an advisor and committee.
  * A first-year research project is designed, conducted, and the results are written up as a research paper and presented in a spring brown bag to the department.


## Year 2
  * A second-year research project is designed, conducted, written up as a research paper, and presented in a spring brown bag to the department.
  * Coursework continues, typically 2 courses per semester. The student takes one or two core courses, and a statistics or methods course.
  * The student also takes the teaching practicum class, which typically involves acting as a TA for a class. Students must take this class three times during their residency in the program.


## Year 3
