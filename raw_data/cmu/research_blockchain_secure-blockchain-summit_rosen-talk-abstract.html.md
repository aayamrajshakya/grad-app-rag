Preference-Driven Herding in the Market for Non-Fungible Tokens
Abstract
Social goods are difficult to study because of selection bias: available data tends to focus on "winners." The non-fungible token (NFT) market offers a rare exception, as the blockchain records every launch, success, and failure. We validate the predictions of social-goods models using comprehensive NFT market data from 2021–2024. Buyers herd in primary market sales: collections either sell out or fail, with demand accelerating as sellouts approach. Early shocks to success persist for months, consistent with preference-driven rather than informational herding. Issuers also substantially underprice NFTs in primary markets, creating profit opportunities exploited by "scalpers."
