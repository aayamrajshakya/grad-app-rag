T cells are essential defenders in the body’s battle against harmful invaders. They are constantly on the lookout for unfamiliar substances displayed on the surfaces of host cells. As a critical part of anti-tumor immunity, T cells detect cancer cells and trigger immune responses to eliminate them. However, T cell functions are often impaired in the tumor microenvironment, making them ineffective at killing cancer cells. Our lab focuses our research on understanding the fundamental mechanisms of T cell anti-tumor immunity in the tumor microenvironment using high-resolution imaging approaches. Our long-term goal is to uncover insights that may advance current cancer immunotherapy strategies.
