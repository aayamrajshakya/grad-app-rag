## Bio
“This year, thousands will try to become quant traders. Few will arrive ready to compete on day one—I will.”
I aim to join a dynamic buy-side trading firm where I can apply my passion for markets, strong quantitative background, and programming expertise to develop profitable trading signals and real-time strategies. I want to be on a team where data drives decisions and where I’m challenged to think fast, iterate faster, and deliver results.
With experience in alpha factor mining, statistical arbitrage, and systematic strategy development, I bring the mindset of a trader and the toolkit of a quant. I've built and backtested intraday strategies using TA-Lib and custom indicators, implemented PCA-processed macro models for forecasting market prosperity, and engineered factor-driven frameworks for risk-managed execution. My work reflects both precision and speed—skills that matter in trading.
Employers will benefit from my ability to turn noisy data into signals, test ideas rigorously, and code production-ready tools in Python. I thrive under pressure, ask the right questions, and adapt quickly to new market regimes.
I bring not only a technical edge but also market intuition sharpened by diverse experience across data science and finance. I want to work where every basis point matters.
I’m available to speak via Zoom or in person to show how I can deliver value to your trading desk from day one.
