He studied at the Boston Conservatory under the Mark H Cooley scholarship, and earned his master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University. Amaury has been regarded as “vigorous and energetic,” performing Latin-American composers: “It was really refreshing to hear a completely different, unconventional Latin rhythm performed by the pianist from this territory who has been awarded many times (Toplicke Vesti, Serbia).” A devoted educator, Amaury has given masterclasses in Latin America, Istanbul, Serbia, Singapore, and the United States.
