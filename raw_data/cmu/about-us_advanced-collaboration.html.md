Our world is changing faster, and its problems are bigger than ever.
Where knowledge once proceeded in a linear fashion from insight to insight, today its movement is startling and unpredictable. The once steady expansion of knowledge has turned exponential, and today new discoveries and information bombard us from every direction. This means that every moment we really know less and less compared with the information available to us. 
The constant intersections of emerging voices and data at play in our everyday lives cause new, complex issues to emerge, challenging the conventional modes of working and demanding a new model for interdisciplinary initiatives.
Now more than ever, we must work together to survive and innovate.  Contact us [partnering with us](https://engineering.cmu.edu/industry-innovation/partnerships.html).

## Rethink the Rink
The [Pittsburgh Penguins](https://www.nhl.com/penguins) teamed up with two international giants of science and technology, Carnegie Mellon University’s College of Engineering and [Covestro,](https://www.covestro.com/en) on a bold initiative to make hockey safer at all levels.
“Rethink The Rink,” a first-of-its-kind project, challenged students to develop material solutions that enhance the safety of the sport without compromising game performance. This cross-discipline work is indicative of our educational approach at Carnegie Mellon.

All problems are a constellation of smaller issues. Solving a problem begins with untangling its issues.
