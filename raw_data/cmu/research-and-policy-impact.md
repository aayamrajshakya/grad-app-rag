Deep learning models improve disease detection, and the [Delphi Center for Innovation](https://delphi.cmu.edu/) in Outbreak Analytics uses AI to enhance epidemic forecasting and readiness, ensuring preparedness for future health crises.
### AI in Education
Named for the founding father of AI, Herbert Simon, the [Simon Initiative](https://www.cmu.edu/simon/index.html) harnesses a cross-disciplinary, learning-engineering ecosystem developed over several decades at CMU with the goal of measurably improving student learning outcomes. Simon Initiative researchers incorporate AI in educational technology like cognitive tutors and courseware that iteratively improves learning and teaching from kindergarten to graduate school. At CMU, the [Eberly Center for Teaching Excellence & Educational Innovation](https://www.cmu.edu/teaching/) provides a blueprint for incorporating AI in the classroom.
### AI in Society and Workforce
Even as we break new ground, we recognize the importance of bringing interdisciplinary teams together to explore the impact of this technology. At CMU, scientists and engineers work together with philosophers, artists and economists to discover what might be possible, while ethicists, social scientists and policy experts guide our path. The university-wide [Block Center for Technology and Society](https://www.cmu.edu/block-center/) is a hub for this work, and is engaged in three primary focus areas: how emerging technologies will alter the future of work, how AI and analytics can be harnessed for social good, and how innovation in these spaces can be more inclusive and improve quality of life for all.
### Transforming Science
The future of science is being driven by powerful AI technologies that are essential to the analysis, connection and application of massive data streams. At CMU, we are leading the science revolution by bringing our strengths in computational methods to scientific discovery and inquiry. The birthplace of cognitive psychology, CMU has built on our legacy in brain science through our [Neuroscience Institute](https://www.cmu.edu/ni/), where neuroscientists, psychologists, statisticians, computer scientists and engineers drive new breakthroughs. We are also the first academic institution to launch a [cloud lab](https://ai.cmu.edu/research-and-policy-impact/ai-for-science) for artificial intelligence-driven experimentation, revolutionizing academic laboratory research.
## Decades Ahead of the Curve
Groundbreaking work by university researchers has empowered CMU to define computer science and AI since its inception. Key milestones include launching the first U.S. university robotics institute in 1979 and creating the world’s first dedicated computer science college in 1988, fostering innovations in machine learning and technologies like autonomous vehicles.
