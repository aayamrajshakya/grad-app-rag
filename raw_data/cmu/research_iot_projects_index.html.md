Funding for these IoT@CyLab projects was made possible by sponsorships from Amazon Web Services, AT&T Business, Cisco, Infineon Technologies, and Nokia Bell Labs.
Carnegie Mellon CyLab’s Secure and Private IoT Initiative ([IoT@CyLab](https://cylab.cmu.edu/research/iot/index.html)) is supporting 12 Internet of Things (IoT)-related projects for one year. While all IoT security and privacy topics are within scope and the focus on Industrial IoT (IIoT) is still central, IoT@CyLab is adding an emphasis on research to help people stay secure as they bring more connected devices into the home as many people continue work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.
