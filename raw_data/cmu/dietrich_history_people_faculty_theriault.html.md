## Bio
Noah Theriault is Associate Professor of Anthropology in Carnegie Mellon University’s Department of History. As a political ecologist, he uses methods from anthropology, history, and geography to study how the globalization of capitalism shapes social and environmental inequality at the local level. His long-term research in the Philippines investigates these dynamics in both rural and urban settings, asking how bureaucrats, activists, scientists, farmers, workers, and other actors negotiate global forces of change in their everyday lives. He also works with scholars, practitioners, and advocates from around the world to explore how collaborative research can contribute to community organizing and collective action. 
Since 2006, Theriault’s research has tracked the collision of conservation, capitalism, and Indigenous rights in Palawan, an island widely coveted as the Philippines’ “last frontier.” His forthcoming book – A Forest of Dreams: Conservation, Capitalism, and Indigenous Rights in the Philippines 
Theriault is currently working on two newer projects. The first, previewed in [Edge Effects](https://edgeeffects.net/public-utility-vehicle/), examines the politics of infrastructure in the Philippine capital, Manila, where the city’s apocalyptic traffic congestion has become a fulcrum for struggles over social and environmental inequality. The second, with [Nida Rehman](https://www.architecture.cmu.edu/profiles/nida-rehman) in CMU’s School of Architecture, aims to establish a community-based energy justice research agenda for Northern Appalachia.
These projects reflect a broader commitment to collaborative research that advances community organizing and collective action. In 2016, Theriault helped found an international network of Indigenous and allied researchers, who work together to foster relational, reciprocal, and regenerative spaces of knowledge creation. In 2020, he partnered with Alex Nading to lead a Wenner Gren workshop on “[Collaborative Ecologies: Anthropologies of (and for) the More-Than-Human City](https://anthrodendum.org/2020/10/06/collaborative-ecologies-anthropologies-of-and-for-survival-in-the-more-than-human-city/)” and, in 2021, published with Simi Kang a state-of-the-field article on “[Toxic Research: Political Ecologies and the Matter of Damage](https://doi.org/10.3167/ares.2021.120102).”
Currently, Theriault has served on the executive board of the [Philippine Studies Group](https://philippinestudiesgroup.wordpress.com/) of the Association for Asian Studies, as co-convenor of the [Environmental Humanities Research Seminar](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/centers-seminars/ehrs-seminar.html), and as Visiting Professor in the Indigenous Studies program at the University of the Philippines - Baguio. At CMU, he serves as the Faculty Advisor for the [Anthropology Minor](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/undergraduate/minors/anthropology.html) and co-organizer of the History Department Research Seminar.
