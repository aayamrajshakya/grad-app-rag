# Engineering Concentrations
All EST&P students must complete 36 units within one of six Engineering Concentrations.   
Advanced Study students may complete their Advanced Study Concentration by satisfying 36 units within a second of the six Engineering Concentrations.
Courses that satisfy the requirements for the Engineering Concentration include disciplinary core courses and energy related electives. Tables of approved courses permitted to satisfy each of the six engineering concentrations are available via the following hyperlinks:
