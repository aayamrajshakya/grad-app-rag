## What Will You Gain?
The Product Design Innovation certificate introduces design techniques that challenge students’ comfort zones and encourage innovative thinking in product design. The result is a more thorough understanding of the end user’s needs and likes. Students also gain knowledge of the techniques required to deploy a design that exceeds user expectations — while building product loyalty.
#### You'll gain:
  * Exposure to foundational design skills including free-form sketching, UX feature analysis, concept modeling.
  * The application of these skills to design challenges.
  * Effective prototyping and testing.
  * Design skills for services and experiences.


## Curriculum Details
Across both courses in the Product Design Innovation certificate, students will learn design principles and techniques for product development that can be applied to tangible products, services, experiences, and related systems. The coursework challenges students to apply their learning in the context of research, sketching, model making, user testing, and presentation. Students will use traditional design skills as they visualize and represent design concepts and solutions. They'll consider holistic "product" offerings that span UI/UX, physical products, and human activity as they move through the coursework.
## Course 1: 49-600, Introduction to Design Innovation
#### COURSE HIGHLIGHTS
  * Learn methods to understand a breadth of user needs
  * Gain skills in techniques and applications to create tangible products and product features
  * Hone skills needed to visualize and represent concepts efficiently
  * Generate a range of solutions via methods of early prototyping and testing


#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is an introduction to design principles for product development and also instructs students in techniques and applications for tangible products. During the course, students will learn about the design process and the steps designers take from an understanding of user needs to the creation of a fully considered solution that meets those needs and delights the user. Building on the general principles introduced in the course, the course will give students the opportunity to apply their learning in the context of tangible products (research, sketching, model making, user testing and presentation).
The relationship among design, product development, and business is explored with class projects, readings, discussions, and the analysis of artifacts and process.
## Course 2: 49-601, Innovation of Services & Experiences
Pre/Co-requisite: 49-600 - Introduction to Design Innovation
#### COURSE HIGHLIGHTS
  * Learn techniques to design services and experiences, easily distinguishing and shifting between different perspectives on the same design problem space
  * Leverage service and experience innovation frameworks to explain how an offering unfolds for people
  * Design holistic "product" offerings that span UI/UX, physical products, and human activity
  * Gain fluency to articulate offerings that are made up of systems of products, services and other components


#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will define and study services, experiences, and related systems.
The learning will take place via lectures, studio projects, and verbal and written exposition. Students will be working in familiar and unfamiliar forms including concepts for products, documents, events, spaces, activities, scripts, and software. Classwork will be done individually and in teams.
“I appreciate that my peer group is global. I have classmates from Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. Just being able to interact with them and learn from them and learn about their perspective in terms of innovation is very eye-opening.”
- Molly Wiebe, MIIPS Online '25
