# Politics, Capitol Hill, and Government Relations
Have you dreamed of working for a senator on Capitol Hill? Interested in learning about the inner workings of a campaign? Considering a career as a Hill staffer, lobbyist, or political strategist? An internship with one of the below organizations might be for you!
Senators and representatives hire several interns every semester to work in their offices on Capitol Hill. As a Hill intern, you will help staffers with research, lead visitors on Capitol Building tours, and respond to letters, emails, and phone calls from constituents. You can apply to work with your own representative or any who are working on legislation of interest. If you're thinking about working on a campaign, an internship with the Republican or Democratic National Committees is a good place to start. If you want to learn more about the inner workings of lobbying and how different industries interact with lawmakers, you should also consider an internship with a government relations organization, where you can expect to help with research and communications.
The House and the Senate recruit through public bulletins, published each week. You can view the current openings for the House here and the Senate here.
If you’re interested in examining US or global politics specifically through a research lens, you should also explore the think tanks tab.
