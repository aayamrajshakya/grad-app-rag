# Dual-Degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies (Portugal Partnership)
After completing the majority of their academic requirements, students return to Portugal for the next two years to conduct extensive research, ultimately leading to a dissertation topic that will be publicly defended. One adviser from each institution co-supervises their student’s progress and helps to define their final thesis topic.
## Overview
The LTI offers a dual-degree Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies in cooperation with:
  * Universidade de Aveiro ([Ph.D. in Computer Engineering](https://www.ua.pt/deti/course/236/?p=1)), Universidade do Minho ([Ph.D. in Informatics](https://www.eng.uminho.pt/en/study/3-ciclo/_layouts/15/UMinho.PortaisUOEI.UI/Pages/CatalogoCursoDetail.aspx?itemId=3451&catId=10)) and the Universidade do Porto (FCUP, Ph.D. in Computer Science and FEUP, Ph.D. in Computer Science) as part of MAPi;
  * Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências – FCUL ([Ph.D. in Informatics](https://fenix.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/degrees/informatica-564500436615358/descricao)) 
  * Universidade de Lisboa, Instituto Superior Técnico – IST ([Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deic/partnerships-and-dual-degrees), [Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deec/descricao), [Ph.D. in Information Security](https://fenix.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/cursos/deaseginf))
  * Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia – FCTUNL ([Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://www.di.fct.unl.pt/en/education/doctoral-program-computer-science))
  * Universidade de Coimbra, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia – FCTUC ([Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology](https://apps.uc.pt/courses/en/course/220))


Students jointly enrolled in the LTI Ph.D program spend a year in Portugal, then two years at Carnegie Mellon taking classes in linguistics, computer science, statistical learning and task orientation.
After completing the majority of their academic requirements, students return to Portugal for the next two years to conduct extensive research, ultimately leading to a dissertation topic that will be publicly defended. One adviser from each institution co-supervises their student’s progress and helps to define their final thesis topic.
## Requirements
Students participating in the dual-degree program will spend their first year in Portugal, followed by two years in Pittsburgh to complete their coursework. They will complete a maximum of eight courses with a proper balance of focus areas (linguistics, computer science, statistical/learning and task orientation). After that, they will return to Portugal for their last two years, pursuing research and completing their dissertation. For more, see the [Carnegie Mellon | Portugal page](http://www.cmuportugal.org/).

## Admissions
Students applying to the dual degree program must apply through Carnegie Mellon's online application. In addition to the requirements listed below, prospective students must also contact [Stacey Young](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/academics/phd-programs/dual-degree-phd-lti.html#portugal-contact) when applying.
Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science has a centralized [online application process](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr#HERE). Applications and all supporting documentation for fall admission to any of the LTI's graduate programs must be received by the application deadline. Incomplete applications will not be considered. 
The application window for the Fall 2026 admissions cycle will open on September 3, 2025. Please see the SCS Graduate Admissions Page.
Application Deadlines
Applications open on September 3, 2025

Fee Waivers
If the application fee presents financial hardship to the applicant, they may apply for a financial or participants of program fee waiver which is available within the application.
Requirements
The School of Computer Science requires the following for all Ph.D. applications. (Please note, these requirements may change for future application cycles.)
  * GRE scores: These must be less than five years old. The GRE Subject Test is not required, but is recommended. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.
  * TOEFL scores: Required if English is not your native language. No exceptions. These scores may be more than two years old if you have pursued or are pursuing a bachelor's or graduate degree in the United States. (While the TOEFL is preferred, the IELTS test may also be submitted.) Successful applicants will have a minimum TOEFL score of 100. Our Institution Code is 4256; the Department Code is 78.
  * Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.
  * Current resume.
  * Statement of Purpose.
  * Three letters of recommendation.


For more details on these requirements, please see the[SCS Doctoral Admissions page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/doctoral-admissions).
In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires:
  * Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter.
  * Video Essay (optional, but strongly recommended). You will have 1-3 minutes to record a video of yourself answering a question that we will provide. You will first be able to complete a test video, which will give you instructions and allow you to practice how the recording will work. You can complete more than one test video. Once you are satisfied and have confirmed that you're ready to record your real submission, you will receive a random question and will have 10 (ten) seconds before the video begins recording. You then have up to 3 minutes to speak and can stop recording once you are done speaking. You will be given 3 attempts, and a new question will be provided with each attempt.Note that the video (and audio) must be of the applicant (not a proxy). If there is more than one person in the video, please clarify which person is the applicant. What you do or say is totally up to you as long as you provide the information requested.If all else is equal, an applicant with a video essay will have an advantage over an otherwise identical applicant without a video essay.Again, this is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested.


  
No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.
