In order to encourage breadth and increase flexibility for our PhD students as of Fall 2025, this is the new PhD curriculum.
**Required** **Courses**(Should be taken in the first semester since both are only offered in the fall semester)
10-715 Advanced Introduction to Machine Learning36-705 Intermediate Statistics for PhD
**Menu** **Courses**
PhD Students take one course from each category:
**One Theory course** : mathematical foundations and proofs**One Methods course** : algorithms and implementation**One Practice course** : application and aspects of ML in practice
**_Categories for Menu Courses:_**
**Theory** (choose one)
10-708 Probabilistic Graphical Models 10-716 Advanced ML: Theory and Methods10-725 Optimization for Machine Learning10-734 Foundations of Autonomous Decision Making under Uncertainty36-709 Advanced Statistical Theory I36-710 Advanced Statistical Theory II
**Methods** (choose one)
10-723 Generative AI10-703 Deep Reinforcement Learning & Control10-707 Advanced Deep Learning10-714 Deep Learning Systems15-750 Algorithms in the Real World15-850 Advanced Algorithms 15-780 Graduate Artificial Intelligence36-707 Regression Analysis
**Practice** (choose one)
10-718 ML in Practice 10-805 ML with Large Datasets 
MLD PhD students must take **two electives,** while in the program, which may be any course at the 700 or higher level in the School of Computer Science or Department of Statistics and Data Science (36-xxx), including additional courses from the Menu Core, or other courses by approval. The elective is chosen in consultation with the student's advisor. Courses outside SCS or Statistics and Data Science must have approval from the student's Advisor. Have your advisor send the approval to the PhD Program Manager.
Special Notes for Joint Ph.D. Programs
Statistics and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program
  * Students must choose from the menu core courses with a prefix in a department that is not their home department.
  * Students must take one elective, while in the program, which may be any ML course or Menu Course at the 700 or higher level. The second elective may be satisfied within the student's home department.
  * Students may satisfy the Practice course requirement through the Advanced Data Analysis project in Statistics. 


Neural Computation and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program
  * Students may satisfy the Practice course requirement by completing a data-intensive project for their second year milestone. 
  * Students must take one elective, while in the program, which may be any ML course or Menu Course at the 700 or higher level. The second elective may be satisfied within the student's home department.


Heinz and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program 
  * Students complete the Practice course requirement in their program.
  * Students must take one elective, while in the program, which may be any ML course or Menu Course at the 700 or higher level. The second elective may be satisfied within the student's home department.
