# Governance
Since its founding, Carnegie Mellon University has emphasized cross-disciplinary research and education. In this innovative tradition, the Master of Science in Computational Finance (MSCF) program was formed in 1994 as the interdisciplinary collaboration of four colleges: the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu), the [Department of Statistics & Data Science](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/), the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](http://www.math.cmu.edu/index.php), and the [Tepper School of Business](http://tepper.cmu.edu/).
The MSCF program is governed by a Steering Committee composed of a senior faculty member from each of the four participating colleges and an executive director. Program and curriculum modifications are made by the Steering Committee after gathering input from various sources, including students, employers, MSCF alumni, and the MSCF Advisory Board, among others.
