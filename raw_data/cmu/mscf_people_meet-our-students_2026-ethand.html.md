## Bio
Yisen (Ethan) Du graduated from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, in 2024 with a Bachelor’s in Financial Engineering. His passion for quantitative finance is driven by a deep curiosity to understand the “why” behind financial anomalies, combined with a solid foundation in mathematical modeling and programming. He has interned in different quant funds for over 13 months and learned the life cycle of building quant strategies from an intuitive idea to real-world trading. One ML-based strategy he built through tick-level signals has been implemented in actual trading and achieved stable excessive returns.He also spent his junior year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley and was selected as a research assistant through the URAP program. He collaborated with a leading FinTech company and participated in a project focused on improving financial inclusion through LLM and Big Data. Working with people from different countries and presenting data-driven analyses to industry partners refined his communication skills and made him an active teammate in multicultural settings. He aimed to become a quant researcher after graduation.
