# MSE for Professionals
Do you find yourself working on a project that is overcome by slow progress and technical debt, where you feel there must be a better way to manage code and improve the quality of your software? Or, maybe you have reached a plateau in your career, and you are eager to reach the next level? The Master of Software Engineering (MSE) program for professionals builds on a foundation of skills and industry experience, and teaches you state-of-the-art practices used by top software engineering companies.
The MSE program is designed for experienced software developers with at least two years of full-time professional experience. The program includes coursework on requirements, architecture, analysis and project management, while providing students with greater flexibility in directing their education. The program is an on-campus, 16-month long program when pursued full-time. Part-time options are available for U.S. Citizens or Permanent Residents of the United States.
