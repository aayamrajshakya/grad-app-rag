## About the Carnegie-Rochester-NYU Conference on Public Policy
The Carnegie-Rochester-NYU Conference on Public Policy (CRNYU)
Each conference is organized around a particular theme or topic with papers prepared by leading scholars with expertise in the area. Participants are united by their interest in the issues discussed and by their belief that analysis, evidence, and informed discussion have lasting effects on the public and its institutions. The conference receives financial support from the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/) and from its host institutions.
## Conference History
The[William E. Simon School of Business Administration](https://simon.rochester.edu/) at the University of Rochester and the Center for the Study of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University.
Under the leadership of the late Allan Meltzer (Carnegie Mellon University) and the late Karl Brunner (University of Rochester), the conference developed into a semi-annual event.
Subsequently, [New York University's Stern School of Business](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/) joined Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business and the University of Rochester’s Simon School of Business as a host institution.
Today, the conference takes place annually in the spring of each year and rotates between each host institution.
