# Climate and environment
We seek policy solutions that effectively address environmental issues using a synthesis of perspectives from the sciences and other disciplines. Our research in critical factors, including greenhouse gasses, atmospheric particulates and aerosols, and climate-related decision-making, has helped us affect policy change.
