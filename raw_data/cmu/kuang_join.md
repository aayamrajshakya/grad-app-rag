We are looking for highly motivated postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and research technicians to join us. We are dedicated to providing an excellent environment for creative thinking and multidisciplinary research. Our lab uses an integrated, multidisciplinary approach to address questions about intestinal host-microbial interactions, circadian rhythms, and epigenetic regulation in digestive system diseases and metabolic disorders.
If you are interested in joining the Kuang lab, please email me (zhengkua@andrew.cmu.edu). Currently, multiple positions are open (postdoc, graduate student, undergraduate student, lab manager, research assistant).
_Postdoctoral Fellows_
We seek Postdoctoral Fellows who are interested in epigenetic regulation of host-microbial interactions in the gut. The approaches used in our lab range from genomics and computational approaches for identifying and characterizing essential epigenetic pathways to molecular, cellular and mouse genetic approaches for determining the molecular mechanisms. Our aim is to decipher the epigenetic code in host-microbial interactions and understand the implications in digestive system diseases and metabolic disorders.
A PhD in a STEM field is required at the time of hiring. Experience in related areas is recommended. The salary is competitive and commensurate with experience.
Apply for email to Dr. Kuang (zhengkua@andrew.cmu.edu) with a CV, a cover letter and contact information for three references.
