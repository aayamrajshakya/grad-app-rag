## [Kasey Creswell](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/creswell-kasey.html)
Associate Professor of Psychology
I am broadly interested in understanding the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of addiction, as well as identifying those who may be particularly vulnerable to addiction. My research focuses on uncovering basic affective and cognitive mechanisms of cigarette craving and alcohol use, and emphasizes the importance of social and biological/personality factors in the etiology and maintenance of alcohol and tobacco use disorders.
## [Brooke Feeney](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/feeney-brooke.html)
Professor of Psychology
My research addresses the general question of how close relationships, and specific social behaviors and social interactions occurring within those relationships, facilitate or hinder human thriving. This work considers the immediate and long-term impact of specific social behaviors and social interaction patterns (and related biological processes) on important thriving outcomes such as mental and physical health, relationship health and stability, and goal progress and accomplishment.
## [Anna Fisher](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/fisher-anna.html)
Associate Professor of Psychology
I study development of attention regulation, role of attention in learning in formal and informal settings, and development of higher-order cognition including semantic memory and reasoning. On-going projects in the lab examine how children sustain attention to dynamic events, the role children’s developing attention regulation plays during reading, and learning-driven changes in semantic memory in ecologically-valid settings.

Director of Graduate Studies and Professor of Psychology
We study how people adjust to chronic illness, most recently diabetes. With experimental and field research, we focus on the role of interpersonal factors, such as communal coping, on psychological, behavioral, and physical health.
## [Laurie Heller](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/heller-laurie.html)
Professor of Psychology (Teaching)
My research examines the human ability to use sound to understand what events are happening in the environment. My perceptual experiments address whether there are acoustic cues that reveal attributes of sound events, and how our knowledge of these cue-attribute relationships influences our discrimination of sounds, labeling of sounds, and multimodal perception.
## [Marcel Just](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/psychology/directory/core-training-faculty/just-marcel.html)
D.O. Hebb University Professor of Psychology
My research uses fMRI (and occasionally EEG) to determine how concepts, sentences and other knowledge structures are neurally represented, ultimately decoding thoughts from their fMRI signature. I am also investigating the applications of this approach to psychiatric alterations of concepts (particularly in suicidal ideation) and in the representation and learning of scientific concepts.
