The Master's in Machine Learning program is intended for applicants not integrating the master's into their CMU bachelor's degree.
CMU undergraduates are encouraged to consider the [Fifth-Year Master's in Machine Learning](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms), but are welcome to apply to this 16-month program instead.
# Curriculum and Typical Schedule
The Master's in Machine Learning program requires six core courses, three electives and a practicum. Refer to the [Machine Learning Master's Curriculum](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum) [](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/machine-learning-masters-curriculum)page for full information. As the schedule below shows, the M.S. in machine learning can be completed in three semesters by a motivated and well-prepared student. However, some students finish in four semesters, spending the additional time on either research or filling in gaps in their undergraduate training.
### Year One, Fall Semester
  * 10-701 or 10-715: Intro to Machine Learning
  * 36-700 or 36-705: Statistics
  * One Elective


### Year One, Spring Semester
  * Two Core Courses 
  * One Elective


### Year One, Summer Semester
  * Practicum (internship or research related to machine learning)


### Year Two, Fall Semester
  * 10-718: Machine Learning in Practice 
  * One Core Course
  * One Elective

# Finances
The M.S. in Machine Learning program does not provide any financial support and the student must pay tuition, student fees and living expenses on their own.
See the [financial information page](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/ms-finance) for costs.
# Apply
The Machine Learning Department uses the [School of Computer Science (SCS) Graduate Online Application](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr). You may apply for multiple programs at Carnegie Mellon and the Machine Learning Department's M.S. Admissions Committee will consider your application independently.
Applications are accepted only once a year. All students begin the program in August, having applied the previous December.
For application information, including application deadlines, refer to the [SCS Master's Admissions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions) page and [SCS Master's Admissions FAQ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/faq).
# Frequently Asked Questions
### What are the prerequisites? Do I need an undergraduate degree in computer science? What test scores do I need?
We welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds and an undergraduate degree in computer science is not required.
Incoming students must have a strong background in computer science, including a solid understanding of complexity theory and good programming skills, as well as a good background in mathematics. Specifically, the first-year courses assume at least one year of college-level probability and statistics, as well as matrix algebra and multivariate calculus.
For our introductory machine learning course, our [self-assessment test](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ewcohen/10-601/self-assessment/Intro_ML_Self_Evaluation.pdf) will give you some idea of the background we expect students to have.
The average scores of accepted applicants for the MS in Machine Learning for fall 2025 were as follows:
  * Undergraduate Overall GPA: 3.9/4.0 or 9.5/10.0.
  * GRE Quantitative: 169 (88th percentile)
  * GRE Verbal: 160 (80th percentile)
  * GRE Analytical Writing: 4.1 (63rd percentile)
  * TOEFL: 111


Scores varied significantly and are only a small portion of applicants' qualifications. We do take people with a range of backgrounds for the master's program. For information about our selectivity rate and other statistics, refer to [the comparison table of all SCS master's programs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs-comparison).
### Are GRE scores required?
For applicants applying to the MS in Machine Learning program in Fall 2025 for a start date of August 2026, GRE scores are optional  
We do not require or expect applicants to take a GRE Subject Test.
### Is it possible to complete the degree online?
No. At this time, we do not offer online or distance-learning classes. You must be physically present in Pittsburgh and able to attend classes on campus to complete the program.
### Is it possible to complete the degree part-time?
Yes, you can study part-time as long as you can attend classes. International students should be aware that student visas require students to complete the program full-time and finish by the end of their third semester (in December).
### Is it possible to apply or begin the program in spring?
No. Applications are accepted only in December and students must begin the program in August. We cannot make exceptions to this due to the timing of our Core courses.
### Can I switch between the Master's in Machine Learning and Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study?
No. Applicants must choose to apply to one program, the other program, or both. If an applicant is admitted to both programs, they must choose which program they're entering when they accept their offer of admission. It isn't possible to switch programs later.
### Can I transfer in from another university or from another program at CMU?
No, you may not simply transfer into our program. You must submit an application and be accepted into the program, following the same application procedure as other applicants. Furthermore, the machine learning program does not accept transfer credit from other universities, although in certain situations a specific course requirement may be waived and an additional elective may be taken in its place.
Current CMU undergraduates may be able to apply for the [fifth-year master's](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms), which begins immediately after they have completed their bachelor's degree.
### I already have a master's degree. Can I still apply?
Yes, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. As with all applicants, make sure that your statement of purpose makes it clear why you believe an additional master's will help you achieve your goals.
### How does the Master's in Machine Learning program compare with other programs at CMU?
The School of Computer Science has compiled a [comparison of its master's programs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs), including a [table comparing program outcomes, average applicant scores and selectivity rates](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs-comparison).
### Is this a STEM program?
Yes. As a program in Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, the Master's in Machine Learning is a STEM program.
### Where are your graduates working?
The Career and Professional Development Center compiles [Post-Graduate Salaries and Destination Information](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html) about all graduates.
### When should I apply? When will I hear back?
The application deadline can be found on the [SCS Master's Admissions](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr) page. It changes from year to year, but is generally in late November or early December. You should expect an email response sometime in February. If you apply to multiple programs, you should expect to receive separate responses from each program.
### Where can I find more information?
The [Machine Learning Master's Programs Handbook [PDF]](https://ml.cmu.edu/current-students/ml-masters-handbook-fall2025.pdf) contains the full program requirements.
