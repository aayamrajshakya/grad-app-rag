## Bio
Dr. Ezelle Sanford III is an Assistant Professor in the Department of History at Carnegie Mellon University. His scholarship sits at the intersection of African American, medical, and urban histories. He is particularly interested in histories of race, science, and medicine from the 19th century to the present. He is currently working on a book project titled Segregated Medicine: How Racial Politics Shaped American Healthcare, which utilizes the case of St. Louis’s Homer G. Phillips Hospital, America’s largest segregated hospital in the mid-twentieth century, to trace how the logic and legacy of racial segregation established structures of healthcare inequality that persist to this day. His work has been featured in popular and academic publications, most recently in Gender and History. His scholarship has received several national fellowships and awards.
