## Bio
Daniel attended Brazil’s most prestigious engineering school, Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Aerospace Engineering and a Specialization degree in Data Science. His professional journey in the financial sector has been diverse and impactful. At LOTE45, he served as a Risk Analyst, specializing in exotic derivatives modeling, Greeks calculations, stress testing, VaR, and Monte Carlo simulations. Later, as a Data Scientist at Kinea Investimentos, Daniel applied machine learning techniques to forecast redemptions and subscriptions within the Brazilian investment fund industry. Just prior to joining the MSCF program, he worked at BTG Pactual, where he developed a more robust and faster system to calculate Risk-Weighted Assets for the Basel Regulatory Framework and other Brazilian Central Bank requirements. His commitment to professional development is evidenced by his attainment of CFA and FRM certifications. Daniel joined the MSCF program to expand his knowledge in the financial markets and to delve deeper into the intersection of finance, mathematics, statistics, and computing. In his free time, Daniel enjoys flight sports. He has experience with skydiving and recently obtained a pilot’s license. After graduation, he aims to pursue a career in quantitative trading, quantitative research, or quantitative portfolio management.
