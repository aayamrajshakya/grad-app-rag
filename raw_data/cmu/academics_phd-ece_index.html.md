Students in the ECE PhD program are provided with a research-intensive study of the fundamentals of electrical and computer engineering. Students will create and disseminate knowledge of electrical and computer systems during the course of obtaining the PhD degree. Upon enrollment in the department, students, with the help of a faculty advisor, define an education and research program consistent with their background and best-suited to their own academic goals.
