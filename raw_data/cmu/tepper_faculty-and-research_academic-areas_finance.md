# Finance
Finance focuses on how corporations, governments and individuals raise funds and allocate resources over time, under conditions of risk or uncertainty. Financial markets and financial asset prices play a critical role in determining optimal funding and resource allocation decisions and are a central focus of research and teaching in finance at the Tepper School. Specific study includes savings and investment strategies, financial market regulation, international finance, tax effects and the banking system.
