## Bio
Ananya Unnikrishnan graduated from Nanyang Technological University in 2024 with a double degree in Computer Science and Business. Her experiences in the Athena Trade and Risk Services teams and the Market Data Services team at a global investment bank strengthened her computational skills and deepened her understanding of financial technology. She also explored the intersection of AI and finance through research projects, including using neural networks for options pricing and reinforcement learning for portfolio management. Ananya joined the MSCF program to build on her quantitative background and to further develop models that integrate machine learning with financial theory. After graduation, she aims to pursue a career in quantitative research, algorithmic trading, or AI-driven asset management.
