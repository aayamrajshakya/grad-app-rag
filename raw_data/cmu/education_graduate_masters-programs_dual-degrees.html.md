The College of Engineering offers a dual degree master’s program for students that seek to gain exposure to technology innovation and management as it relates to engineering practice.
## Master of Science in Engineering (Coursework) & Technology Innovation Management (E&TIM)
The Master of Science in Engineering & Technology Innovation Management (E&TIM) program offers students the opportunity to explore technology innovation and management and to integrate this knowledge with engineering practice. Materials Science and Engineering Master’s students will be able to leverage their technical expertise and learn how to drive value creation from technical innovation based on their understanding of technical concepts, innovation management fundamentals, and real world applications in materials science industries.
The E&TIM dual degree option is a two-year program that “sandwiches” the ETIM Master of Science between the fall and spring semesters of the MS in Materials Science and Engineering program. This program also requires a summer internship project which provides corporate experience in E&TIM.
Students would apply to the E&TIM Dual Degree program when applying to the Master of Science in Materials Science and Engineering (course option) degree program that includes 96-units of coursework.
