# Student Employment FAQs
## How do my Work-Study earnings post to my student account?
Work-Study earnings DO NOT post to your student account. When subtracting your financial aid from your bill to plan for payment for the semester, please do not factor the Work-Study funds as a credit. In order to use your Work-Study earnings to make payments to your student account, you should sign up for direct deposit in order to have your paychecks deposited into a checking or savings account. Enroll in online banking on [Student Information Online](http://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio) to make payments to your student account. 
Note: Prior to your first day of work, you must complete certain paperwork, including the I-9 form if you have not previously been employed by Carnegie Mellon. [Learn more](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e-verify/index.html). 
## How can I find which Work-Study jobs are available - and once I find one, where do I apply?
You can search for Work-Study or Federal Community Service positions on Handshake, Carnegie Mellon's online recruiting system. Within Handshake, you can submit resumes online, sign up for interviews and find contact information for potential employers. Visit the [Career & Professional Development](http://www.cmu.edu/career/) website to learn more about finding and applying for Work-Study positions.

## Am I guaranteed to receive a Work-Study job if I have Work-Study eligibility?
All students interested in participating in Work-Study are responsible for finding and applying for a job. Receiving a Work-Study award does not guarantee you a job.
## What do Work-Study jobs pay?
Work-Study earnings vary depending on the student's work schedule and availability. Students may work a total of 37.5 hours per week but are not allowed to work during their scheduled class time
Work-Study students are paid by the hour on a bi-weekly basis. All students must be paid at least minimum wage of $10.00 per hour. For Federal Work-Study and Federal Community Service jobs, the maximum rate per hour is $13 for undergraduates and $17 for graduate students. 
## How do I know if I am eligible for Federal Work-Study?
If you applied for financial aid and are eligible for Work-Study, you will be informed of your Work-Study eligibility in your Financial Aid Award Letter. You will be notified via email when your award letter is ready for viewing on [Student Information Online](http://www.cmu.edu/hub/sio). 
Note: It is possible for a student's Work-Study award amount to change before and during the academic year. Changes could be the result of changing financial circumstances, receipt of additional financial aid, or other factors. All questions about Work-Study awards should be directed to The HUB. 
## If I am NOT eligible for Federal Work-Study, can I receive additional grant money?
Additional grant funding through the Student Financial Aid Office is not available if you are not eligible for Work-Study. The Undergraduate Research Officesupports student research in every field of study and offers the option for students to receive Small Undergraduate Research Grants (SURG). SURG funds maycover research expenses, Summer Fellowshipsfor full-time summer research, and Presentation Awardsto support students presenting at academic conferences. View the Undergraduate Research Office website for more information.

## Am I still able to apply for a job on campus if I am NOT eligible for Federal Work-Study?
If you did not apply for financial aid or are not eligible for Work-Study, you can still work on campus. If you have the qualifications listed in the job description on [Handshake](https://cmu.joinhandshake.com/login), you may still apply. 
## I would like to work with a professor to do research and am eligible for Federal Work-Study; how can I use my Work-Study earnings to pay for this?
To find out if you can use Federal Work-Study earnings to fund research, contact the Undergraduate Research Office. Also be sure to speak with the academic advisor for the department in which you wish to do research to find out about procedures, and also be sure to speak to your own academic advisor.
## How can I use Federal Work-Study funding for an off-campus job?
Carnegie Mellon has partnered with several non-profit organizations in Pittsburgh. These organizations post their jobs as Federal Community Service positions, and are part of the Federal Work-Study program. Off-campus Federal Community Service jobs are also posted in [Handshake](https://cmu.joinhandshake.com/login). You must have Federal Work-Study in order to apply and be hired for a Federal Community Service job.
