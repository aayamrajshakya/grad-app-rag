The department will no longer be admitting and enrolling new students to the MS in Mechanical Engineering - Applied Advanced Study degree after Spring 2024. Students already admitted and enrolled in the MS in Mechanical Engineering - Applied Advanced Study degree during or before Spring 2024 will remain eligible to complete their degree requirements through Spring 2025. Students interested in this program are encouraged to apply to the MS in Mechanical Engineering - Advanced Study degree as the same educational outcomes can be achieved through that degree.

  * Energy and thermal fluid systems
  * Robotic and control systems
  * Self-defined (through petitioning the Department of Mechanical Engineering)


At 126 units, this program can be completed in three semesters including the summer term.
Master’s students talk about their team projects for the Advanced Mechanical Design course:
### Engineering outside of the classroom
As a graduate student, you will be encouraged to participate in co-curricular engineering and design experiences on campus. A sampling includes: the MechE Graduate Research Symposium, college-wide or university-wide research symposia, and organizations such as Carnegie Mellon Racing.
### Each of our master’s programs provides:
  * hands-on learning and collaborative problem-solving through project-based courses
  * flexibility to tailor your curriculum according to your interests and goals
  * ongoing services and programming to enhance communication, leadership, and team-building skills in the Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh ecosystems
