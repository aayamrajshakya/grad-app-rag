## Bio
Deepa Nair is a historian of Modern South Asia. Her research revolves around politics, religion, education, and identity formation in modern India, particularly the effect of ethno-religious nationalism on minorities and nation-building in secular India. Before joining CMU, she taught at the University of Central Florida and Appalachian State University in North Carolina. Nair's teaching interests include the history and culture of South Asia; imperialism, decolonization, and nationalism in South Asia; politics, religion, and gender in contemporary South Asia; legacies of the British raj– including Partition and rise of ethno-religious nationalism; globalization, migration, and South Asian diaspora; Indian historiography and transnational history. She is working on the first edition of  _An Anthology of South Asia_ (Cognella /Routledge) and her monograph on education, state formation, and identity politics in South Asia. In 2021-22, Nair was awarded the Provost's Inclusive Teaching Fellowship.
