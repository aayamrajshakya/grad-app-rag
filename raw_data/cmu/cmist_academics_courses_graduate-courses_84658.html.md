# Money, Connections, and Power: Interests and Influence in the US
## Course Number: 84-658 
Pundits and politicians on both sides of the aisle decry the influence of special interests and lobbyists, but who exactly are these entities, and how much power do they actually possess? This course explores the range of actors who seek to impact policymaking in the US, including individuals, issue groups, unions, corporations, trade associations, and subnational governments, along with the means they employ. We will begin by considering whose interests are reflected in the outcomes of the political process and whose are not. To explain these disparities, the class will examine the major non-electoral avenues of influence in US politics, in particular lobbying, donating to campaigns, mobilizing a membership base, and supplying expertise to politicians. For each of these topics, students will apply real-world data to analyze who engages in these behaviors, how they do so, and what effects their activity has.
