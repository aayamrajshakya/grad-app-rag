# MAM Dual Degrees
* * *
The Heinz College MAM Program has a dual degree partnership with the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. Dual degree programs have distinct admissions requirements, please contact the Admissions office for more information.
Duration: 4 years
The art world continues to evolve in our digitized and connected world. This unique dual degree track gives you a deeper understanding of how legal considerations impact all stages of the artistic process and enhances your ability to protect, represent, and serve artists and cultural institutions alike.
If your future career lies at the intersection of arts management and the law, the MAM-JD dual degree track will get you the comprehensive education you need in less time—and at a significantly lower cost—by merging the quantitative power and interdisciplinary training of a Heinz College MAM degree with a rigorous legal education from University of Pittsburgh.
Students in this dual degree option spend their first year studying full-time at either of the two schools, and the second year full-time at the other. Years three and four are integrated. 
Degrees earned:
Master of Arts Management (MAM)  
Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College
Juris Doctorate   
University of Pittsburgh School of Law

Admissions:
Students must complete applications for both [Heinz College](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/admissions/arts-management/) and University of Pittsburgh School of Law and be accepted into both programs. A third, separate “joint-degree program application” is required by University of Pittsburgh.
Admission to the MAM-JD dual degree program can be granted prior to or during the first year of study at either school, meaning first-year students in either program can still seek admission into the MAM-JD track and stay on the four-year dual-degree schedule.
Financial aid and scholarships are available for MAM-JD from both Heinz College and University of Pittsburgh. Please contact each school’s admissions office for more information.
