# Composition Portfolio Review
Use the drop-down menus below to view the audition requirements for your degree/certificate area.
## Undergraduate
All applicants to composition are expected to prepare the following portfolio requirements:  
  
PORTFOLIO REQUIREMENTS:
  * Three manuscripts of original compositions showing the composer’s range in genre, training, and ability. These scores should showcase your creative ideas in addition to your skill and craft. Attention should be paid to completeness and clarity of your score; alongside pitch and rhythm, be sure to include dynamics, articulations, slurs and phrasing marks, etc where appropriate. Compositions which include live or pre-recorded electronic elements should include a separate staff/line on the score for any necessary components, or any performance directions.
  * An audio recording of a live performance of each of the submitted compositions. If a live performance is not possible, an electronically generated audio recording will be acceptable.
  * Although arrangements of works by other composers are welcome, they will be considered supplementary to the basic requirement for three original works.  
  
**PORTFOLIO REVIEWS** : At the portfolio review, applicants will meet with the composition faculty panel to discuss personal compositional processes, portfolio work, background, and future goals. To a great extent, the composition portfolio review resembles an interview. It will not be necessary for applicants to perform excerpts of their works, either vocally or instrumentally, during the review. Composition candidates are NOT required to complete a separate instrumental or vocal audition.

It will not be necessary for applicants to perform excerpts of their works, either vocally or instrumentally. Composition candidates are not required to complete a separate instrumental or vocal audition.
