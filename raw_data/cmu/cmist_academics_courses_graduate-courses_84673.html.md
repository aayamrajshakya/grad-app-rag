# International Law
## Course Number: 84-673 
This course introduces students to the fundamentals of international law. Although its efficacy is often debated, states regard international law as essential for regulating their international affairs. International law is largely built on consensus, without a global sovereign---what famed jurist T.E. Holland described as "the vanishing point of jurisprudence." In addition to covering the politics, design, organization, and functions of international law, we will devote special attention to how it operates in a world characterized by rapid and ongoing technological change. Our focus will be on the legal interactions between countries, also known as public international law.
