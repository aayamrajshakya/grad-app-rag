## Bio
Caroline graduated from Wellesley College with a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Economics, along with extensive coursework in Statistics and Computer Science. She discovered her passion for quant finance during a Quantitative Research summer internship at Shenwan Hongyuan Securities, where she engineered minute-level trading algorithms for equity trading using machine learning techniques. This involved intricate tasks such as identifying signals in highly noisy high-frequency return data. Her quantitative background and meticulousness, honed through over a decade of musical training, enabled her to excel in this role. At MSCF, Caroline aims to enhance her market and statistical modeling skills and utilize her innate traits to pursue a career in quantitative research or quantitative trading.
