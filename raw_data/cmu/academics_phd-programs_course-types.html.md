# Course Types
The Ph.D. program program defines several different types of courses. This page explains the differences between the different types of courses.
## Undergraduate course
Undergraduate courses
## Graduate course
Graduate courses
## LTI course
An "LTI course" is any 12-unit course with a number of 11-XXX; a 6-unit course with 11-XXX counts as one-half of an LTI course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study.
The LTI allows any one MLD (10-XXX) graduate course to count as an "LTI course"
## SCS course
An “SCS course” is any 12-unit course with a course number indicating a unit of the School of Computer Science (including LTI); a 6-unit course with such a number counts as one-half of an SCS course. Unless otherwise specified, "course" means an actual classroom course, not credit given for research or independent study. 
Any course that satisfies a Breadth requirement can be counted as an "SCS course".
The courses listed below can also be counted as an "SCS course".
Course | Title | Units | Semester  
---|---|---|---  
18-691 | Digital Signal Processing | 12 | Spring  
80-816 | Causality and Machine Learning | 12 | Varies  
## Independent Studies
There are several types of independent studies, as shown below.
Course | Title | Units | Semester  
---|---|---|---  
11-910 |  Directed Research  
Your primary research topic | 1-48 | Both  
11-920 |  Independent Study | 6-18 | Both  
11-920 |  Independent Study: Breadth  
Not in your main area of research | 6-18 | Discontinued  
11-925 |  Independent Study: Area of Concentration  
In your main area of research, but not your primary topic | 6-36 | Discontinued  
11-929 | Masters Thesis | 6-18 | Both  
11-930 |  Dissertation Research  
Ph.D. student research after the thesis proposal is accepted | 5-36 | Both  
Note that the Independent Study courses listed above do not normally count for LTI class credit. The exception is if an Independent Study is used to replace an unavailable LTI course (with prior permission of the chair of the LTI graduate programs).
