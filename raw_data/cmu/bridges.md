#### July 15, 2024: Preprint alert!
Our work, entitled “[Biofilm dispersal patterns revealed using far-red fluorogenic probes](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.15.603607v1),” was just preprinted on biorXiv.Biofilm dispersal is essential for bacteria to spread between infection sites, yet how the process is executed at the single-cell level remains mysterious. Here, we characterize dispersal at unprecedented resolution for the global pathogen Vibrio cholerae. To do so, we first developed a far-red cell-labeling strategy that overcomes pitfalls of fluorescent protein-based approaches. We reveal that dispersal initiates at the biofilm periphery and ∼25% of cells never disperse. We define novel micro-scale patterns that occur during dispersal, including biofilm compression and the formation of dynamic channels. These patterns are attenuated in mutants that reduce overall dispersal or that increase dispersal at the cost of homogenizing local mechanical properties. Collectively, our findings provide fundamental insights into the mechanisms of biofilm dispersal, advancing our understanding of how pathogens disseminate. Check it out!

#### March 6, 2024: The first Bridges lab manuscript it out!
Our work, entitled “[Cell lysis sensing drives biofilm formation in Vibrio cholerae](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46399-1),” was published in Nature Communications.We find that upon exposure to lytic phages, the pathogen V. cholerae rapidly lyses, but then recovers, with surviving cells exhibiting robust biofilm formation. We find that the mechanism underlying this observation is a process we refer to as “lysis sensing”…whereby surviving cells sense a signal released by the death of their kin. We identify the cell lysis signal as an abundant cytoplasmic polyamine, norspermidine, which is detected by an inner-membrane receptor, MbaA, that in turn drives biofilm formation. We determine that additional pathogenic organisms also exhibit multicellular community formation in response to lysis. Given the pervasiveness of lysis in the environment, we propose that lysis sensing is a threat-agnostic mechanism by which bacteria can gauge endangerment.​
