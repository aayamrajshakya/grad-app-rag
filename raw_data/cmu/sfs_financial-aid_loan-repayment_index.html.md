# Federal Loan Repayment
## Loan Repayment Options
Repayment plans determine your monthly student loan payment amount, how many years it will take to pay back what you borrowed, and how much interest you will pay over the life of your loan. Keep in mind, the longer it takes to pay back your loan, the more interest will accrue and increase the overall cost of your loan.

## National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)
The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) is the U.S. Department of Education's central database for student aid. It receives data from schools, agencies that guarantee loans, the Direct Loan program, and other U.S. Department of Education programs. [StudentAid.gov](https://studentaid.gov/). Note that any private loans you have borrowed will not appear in the NSLDS.
## Resolving Loan Repayment Disputes
If students have a dispute with their servicer or another agency regarding repayment of federal student loans, they may consider contacting the [Federal Student Aid Ombudsman](https://studentaid.gov/help-center/answers/article/how-to-contact-ombudsman-group) for assistance.
## Student Loan Default
Student loan borrowers in default have options to repay their loans. Information is available from the [Department of Education](https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/default) and [FinAid.org](http://www.finaid.org/loans/default.phtml).
# Loan Consolidation
As plans are made for repaying student loans, students may be considering loan consolidation as an option. Consolidation allows students to pay off some or all of their existing student loans by combining them into a single, large loan. 
If you decide that consolidation is appropriate, there are two types of programs:
## Federal Consolidation Loans
  * Fixed interest rate based on a weighted average of the current rates on existing loans
  * Deferment options predetermined by federal regulations
  * Cannot include non-federal (private) loan funds


## Private Consolidation Loans
  * Can include both federal and non-federal student loan funds
  * Usually a variable interest rate
  * Forbearances available only at the lender's discretion
