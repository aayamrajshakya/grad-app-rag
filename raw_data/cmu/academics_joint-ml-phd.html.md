Students interested in a machine learning joint Ph.D. should first apply to the Ph.D. program that best aligns with their research interests (e.g., machine learning, statistics, neuroscience, public policy, or social and decision sciences).
The MLD requirements for graduation with a joint machine learning Ph.D. are the same as those for the regular [](https://ml.cmu.edu/current-students/phd-curriculum)[MLD Ph.D.](https://ml.cmu.edu/current-students/phd-requirements) (including the requirement for the Ph.D. thesis committee composition), with the following differences:
  * A joint ML Ph.D. thesis will be a contribution to the combination of machine Learning and the other field.
  * One elective course, the speaking and writing skills requirements may be satisfied within the student’s home department.
  * A joint ML Ph.D. student is still required to TA twice, but only one TA-ship has to be within MLD. 
#### Special Notes for Joint Ph.D. Programs
Statistics and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program
    * Students must choose from the menu core courses with a prefix in a department that is not their home department.
    * Students may satisfy the Practice course requirement through the Advanced Data Analysis project in Statistics. 
Neural Computation and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program
    * Students may satisfy the Practice course requirement by completing a data-intensive project for their second year milestone. 
Heinz and Machine Learning Joint Ph.D. Program 
    * Students complete the Practice course requirement in their program.


A student pursing a joint ML Ph.D. may earn an M.S. degree along the way, either from their home department or from MLD, but not from both. To earn an M.S. in research from MLD, they must satisfy all the relevant [requirements](https://ml.cmu.edu/current-students/phd-ms-research).

# Ph.D. in Statistics and Machine Learning
This Ph.D. program differs from the Machine Learning Ph.D. program in that it places significantly more emphasis on preparation in statistical theory and methodology. Similarly, this program differs from the Statistics Ph.D. program in its emphasis on machine learning and computer science. The Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Statistics is aimed at preparing students for academic careers in both computer science and statistics departments at top universities or industry.
Students in the program must be advised by a faculty member from the home department along with a core faculty member from the joint department as a co-mentor. Joint statistics-MLD faculty cannot serve both roles. Both faculty members must be identified at the time of admission to the joint program.
Note: MLD students can apply for this program after they have completed the courses and have a sponsoring faculty in statistics to make the case for admission.

# Ph.D. in Machine Learning and Public Policy
The Joint Ph.D. Program in Machine Learning and Public Policy is operated jointly by faculty in machine learning and CMU's Heinz College (which has schools of public policy, information systems and management). Students will gain the skills necessary to develop new state-of-the-art machine learning technologies and apply these successfully to real-world policy domains.

# Ph.D. in Neural Computation and Machine Learning
This joint Ph.D. program trains students in the application of machine learning to neuroscience and neural inspired machine learning algorithms by combining core elements of the ML Ph.D. program and the Program in Neural Computation (PNC) offered by the Neuroscience Institute (NI).

# Ph.D. in Autonomous and Human Decision Making
This joint Ph.D. program trains students in both the technology of AI and human decision science, focusing on how and when AI can complement human decision-making. Students will be trained in fundamentals of AI, autonomous decision-making, fundamentals of human decision and behavioral science, cognitive models of decision-making, and the societal impact of AI technologies. This program is offered jointly by faculty in machine learning and social and decision sciences.

## To Be Considered for a Joint ML Ph.D.
To apply to a joint ML Ph.D. program, a student must already be enrolled in one of the participating Ph.D. programs in machine learning, statistics, PNC, Heinz or SDS.
Before applying, a student must meet the following MLD requirements (in addition to any requirements from the other relevant department):
  * Take 10-715, 36-705 and 10-716 and earn at least an A- in your first attempt to take each course. Letter grades are required. (Students who took courses before June 2023 will be grandfathered in under the previous requirement of B+ for the courses already taken.)
  * Identify an [MLD core faculty](https://ml.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty) member who agrees to serve as their MLD mentor.


Applications must be submitted by May 31
## How To Apply
Once you've taken the required courses, follow the instructions below to apply. Submit your online application by May 31.
Include the following information:
  1. Statement of Purpose — Why do you want to pursue the joint Ph.D.?
  2. Your updated CV.
  3. Your unofficial Carnegie Mellon transcript, including your letter grades for 10-715, 36-705 and 10-716.
  4. Your GRE and TOEFL scores (if applicable) from your original application to your current Ph.D. program.
  5. Recommenders: (1) Ask your adviser to send a letter of recommendation with their agreement that the joint program would be a good thing for you to pursue and how it would benefit your research. (2) Ask your ML core faculty mentor to send a letter of recommendation including why you would be a good fit for the joint program.

The online application opens January 15 and deadline is May 31.
## The Role of the MLD Mentor
  * Provides ML expertise, advice and oversight to support the student’s research.
  * Influences the student’s research direction to ensure that their Ph.D. thesis makes a sufficient contribution to machine learning to warranty a joint Ph.D. in machine learning. (A joint ML Ph.D. thesis will make a contribution to the combination of machine learning and the other field). For this influence to be successful, a mentor must engage with the student early in their research exploration.
  * Meets with the student at least once per semester, preferably including the student’s home adviser, to discuss progress and plans. The student is responsible for scheduling the meeting.
  * Maintains contact with the student’s home adviser.
  * Represents the student in MLD’s end-of-semester Ph.D. student review.
  * The MLD mentor does not have a financial responsibility to the student, unless otherwise agreed upon in advance.
