# Congress & National Security
## Course Number: 84-647 
While most of the discussion around US national security is around the President in his role as Commander in Chief, the divided structure of the US government means that Congress also has an important, if under-examined, role to play in US national security. This course will examine the roots and structure of Congressional power over US national security, and the debates between the executive and legislative branches, and within the legislative branch about the direction of US national security, including those areas with a particular impact on technology development and use.
