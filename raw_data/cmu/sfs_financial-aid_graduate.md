# Steps to Apply for Financial Aid
## For Graduate Students
Meeting the cost of a graduate education is a significant, yet rewarding investment. CMU is committed to making it financially possible for graduate students to enhance educational development and reach their career goals. 
## Step 1: Complete FAFSA
Timeline:  
Preferred Deadline:
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required if applying for federal financial aid programs, such as an Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan or Graduate PLUS Loan. A student may need to ask one or both parent(s) to provide information on their FAFSA form based on the student’s dependency status. [Use this tool](https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents) to determine which parent(s) information is needed on your financial aid application.
Submitting the FAFSA as quickly as possible after it opens supports the timely delivery of financial aid offers and disbursement of aid as it allows financial aid staff time to collect and process any supporting documentation that may be required.

## Step 2: Receive Financial Aid Offer
Timeline: (if application is complete)
Once the student's application is complete and all required documents have been submitted, a financial aid package will be determined. The student will receive an email notification that a financial aid offer is available in their [My Student Aid](https://fao.andrew.cmu.edu/forms.html) portal. If a student's circumstances change, then eligibility will be re-evaluated and the student will receive notification that a revised offer is available.

## Step 3: Accept, Reduce or Decline Loans
Timeline:   
Deadline:
In order for any financial aid funds (scholarships and/or loans) to disburse to a graduate student's account, the student must accept or decline all federal loans included in their financial aid award. The amount of awarded loan funds may also be reduced. This simple process can be completed in My Student Aid.

## Step 4: Complete MPN & Entrance Counseling
Timeline:  
Deadline:
All first-time Federal Direct Loan borrowers are required to sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and complete an online entrance counseling session. The session provides information about borrower rights and responsibilities. CMU is notified when a student has completed entrance counseling. Students who completed a federal entrance counseling session while at CMU, do not have to complete another one.

## Step 5: Apply for PLUS Loan (if desired)
Timeline:
[Federal Graduate PLUS Loans](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/plus/index.html) are available to graduate and professional students, allowing a graduate student to borrow on his/her own behalf up to the standard graduate cost of attendance less other aid received to assist with educational expenses. A Grad PLUS Loan is a non-need based loan provided by the Department of Education to creditworthy graduate students.

## Step 6: Title IV Authorizations
Timeline:
Students who are offered and/or receive Title IV funds (federal grants or federal loans) should complete Title IV Authorizations in SIO by selecting 'Financial Aid Permissions' under the 'Finances' tab. When the amount of Title IV funds is greater than the cost of tuition, fees, housing, and dining charges, the credit balance is refunded to the borrower. By completing their authorizations, students designate whether excess funds are held as payment for future semester charges or applied to non-institutional charges. Otherwise, excess Title IV funds are refunded directly to the borrower and any student account balance remaining will be due from the student.

Keep in mind that the amount of federal loans credited to the student account will be less than the total amount borrowed due to [origination fees](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal-loans/direct/index.html).

# Additional Considerations
## Teacher Certification
Teacher certification students at the graduate level should be aware that federal regulations classify them as a grade level 5 undergraduate student for Federal Direct Student Loan purposes. Teacher certification students are, however, considered a graduate student by Carnegie Mellon for academic purposes.
