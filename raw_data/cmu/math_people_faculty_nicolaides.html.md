#  Research 
My main interest lies in getting accurate information from mathematical models using partial differential equations. In recent times I have worked on models from electrodynamics, fluid mechanics, materials science and mathematical finance. The techniques used most are finite difference and finite element methods and, for integral equations, moment methods. This type of mathematics has a practical side (developing algorithms, writing programs and nicely displaying the results) and a theoretical side (mainly, proving rates of convergence and obtaining complexity estimates for many different kinds of algorithms). These two aspects are—or should be—inseparable and I hope that this is reflected in my research activities and those of my students.
