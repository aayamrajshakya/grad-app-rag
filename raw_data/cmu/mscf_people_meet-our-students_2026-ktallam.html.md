## Bio
Kaushik Tallam graduated from the Honors College at Rutgers University in 2024 with a triple major in Mathematics, Statistics, and Applied Sciences. Before joining the MSCF program, he gained exposure to portfolio management through summer internships at Prudential and Valley Bank. At Valley Bank, he leveraged Python to develop an easily accessible application for real-time liquidity assessment. While at Prudential, he conducted thorough analyses of duration and cash management for their portfolios and effectively communicated these intricate analyses to team members in a clear and efficient manner. Through these internships, he discovered his passion for solving complex financial problems through data-driven solutions. To gain a broader understanding of the financial spectrum, he also successfully passed the Level I CFA exam. Kaushik joined the MSCF program to acquire a comprehensive set of cutting-edge techniques that will elevate his quantitative proficiency and help decipher the stories found in real-world data. Upon graduation, he plans to pursue a career in quantitative research, portfolio management, or quantitative trading.
