Our rapidly changing climate, the ever-evolving energy grid, regulations on emissions from power plants and vehicles—the complex challenges facing our environment and the energy systems that power our world require equally complex and sophisticated solutions. Our energy researchers believe these problems can only be solved using a highly interdisciplinary approach. Through the development of non-toxic batteries for energy storage, climate-resilient infrastructure systems, and policy innovations for the future of energy, we're combining civil, environmental, and energy engineering with public policy research to create holistic solutions that will bring the world into a brighter, more sustainable future.
