# Biotechnology and pharmaceutical engineering
Through research at the interface of chemical engineering, molecular biology, and medicine, we can better understand the molecular and cellular contributions to human disease and tissue regeneration. By applying transport, thermodynamics, pharmacodynamics, and kinetics concepts to modern chemical and biological techniques, students:
  * develop safe and effective drug and gene delivery systems
  * improve cellular production systems and analytical detection
  * collaborate with clinicians for biomedical applications
  * partner with industry and across interdisciplinary lines for machine learning-driven drug discovery and pharmaceutical assay development


## Sample research projects
* ### Camila Cué
I'm designing next-generation medical devices to overcome multidrug-resistant microorganisms that cause serious, hard-to-treat infections. Recently, I've demonstrated that electrochemical therapy can be used to alter the metabolic activity of Candidozyma auris cells (a multidrug-resistant yeast considered an urgent threat by the CDC) and potentiate antifungal properties via enhanced diffusion and accumulation. This approach could lead to safer and more effective treatments for life-threatening infections caused by superbugs.
Advisor: [Tagbo Niepa](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/niepa-tagbo.html)
Image: A. Fluorescence imaging of Candidozyma auris cells stained with a LIVE/DEAD yeast assay to evaluate the effects of electrochemical therapy (ECT) on cell metabolic activity. The colors indicate the metabolic state of the cells: live cells produce distinct red dots—known as red cylindrical intravacuolar structures (red CIVS)—while dead or metabolically inactive cells do not, as they cannot process the dye. Untreated cells (left) appear metabolically active and healthy, whereas ECT-treated cells (right) show signs of stress and damage. The smaller side panels display each fluorescence channel separately to aid interpretation. (Scale bar: 3 μm) B. Confocal images showing how an antifungal drug (tagged with a fluorescent dye) penetrates Candidozyma auris cells over time. In untreated cells (top row), drug uptake is minimal. However, when a low direct current (17.5 μA/cm² DC) is applied beforehand, drug diffusion and accumulation are significantly enhanced, particularly after 15 and 60 minutes. (Scale bar: 5 μm)

Gene therapies offer hope for treating previously untreatable conditions, but their production is costly and time-consuming due to the need for rigorous quality control of viral vectors. To enhance accuracy and efficiency, I developed a computer vision model deployed in the Capsidize software, achieving high accuracy in classifying viral capsids and reducing labeling time by 95%.

* ### Catalina Montoya
Many diseases are caused by genetic mutations, but the body’s natural barriers make gene therapy delivery challenging. My research focuses on developing bioinspired delivery systems—like lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)—that can cross these barriers to treat a range of conditions, from neurological disorders to tissue damage. Recently, I’ve shown that these systems can successfully deliver mRNA to the brain and accelerate wound healing in early models.

* ### Huda Usman
My research focuses on developing "microbial nanocultures"—engineered microsystems that enable the growth and study of environmental microbes under controlled, native-like conditions. By combining polymer design, microfluidics, and advanced imaging techniques, I can observe how microbes grow, interact, and respond to their surroundings in real time. This work supports the discovery of new antibiotics and helps us better understand microbial behavior and evolution.
Advisor: [Tagbo Niepa](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/niepa-tagbo.html)
Image: A schematic and microscopy images showcasing the nanoculture platform for cultivating individual soil microbes in semi-permeable, magnetically-responsive polymer shells. This system enables the growth of isolated microbes, real-time imaging, and targeted retrieval from complex environments.
* ### Samantha Yang
My project studies the mechanism behind how extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate drug delivery from lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). Administering LNPs usually results in drug delivery to the liver; however, our lab found that upon injecting LNPs intraperitoneally, a type of EV called exosomes became responsible for drug delivery to the pancreas, a harder target in the body to reach. We are investigating how the exosomes possess this capability with the goal of engineering this phenomenon to reach other places in the body and develop new therapeutics.
Advisor: [Kathryn Whitehead](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/whitehead-kathryn.html)
Image: When LNPs transfect cells, the exosomes that are released have the ability to carry the LNP cargo to new destinations within the body. We are studying the mechanism behind how this is possible. Image created using Biorender.

* ### Alec Johnson
The goal of my project is to quickly and accurately detect all sorts of nucleic acids, including mRNA and viral genomes that are used in the manufacture of vaccines and other therapies. As opposed to the traditional method of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), I am developing electrophoretic tools to check the dosage and quality of these molecules, in which key sequences are "tagged" with synthetic nucleic acids, which anchor into micelles during electrophoresis. In this way, we only assay DNA or RNA that has a sequence of interest.
