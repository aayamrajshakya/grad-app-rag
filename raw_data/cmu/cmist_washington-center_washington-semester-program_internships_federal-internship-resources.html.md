# Federal Agency Internship Resources
Applying for internship opportunities with US government agencies requires more time and planning than traditional internship applications. Many agencies also have very early deadlines. If you’re interested in interning with a federal agency, you’ll need to start working on your application at least one year before you plan to come to Washington.
Follow the steps below to prepare:
  * Before you begin an application, review the [Office of Personnel Management -- Federal Internship Guide](https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/hiring-information/students-recent-graduates/) page for eligibility and general requirements.
  * Check agency internship pages (sample linked below) to determine required documents and application deadlines -- they can vary by agency, so it’s important that you don’t skip this step!
  * When you’re ready to begin searching for openings, use the [USA Jobs -- Federal Internship Job Board](https://www.usajobs.gov). Most agencies advertise their openings here, as well as on their own websites. Start by searching with the keyword “intern.”
  * If you have any questions about the process or individual applications, reach out to CMIST Deputy Director Emily Half to set up an application consultation.


Below are links to some of the most popular federal internship programs to get you started. There are hundreds of Federal Agencies and offices, however, so use USA Jobs to find additional opportunities that are of interest to you!
