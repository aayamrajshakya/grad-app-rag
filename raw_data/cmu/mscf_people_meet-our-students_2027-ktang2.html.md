Liwen (Kevin) Tang graduated from Emory University with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics & Statistics and a minor in Finance. He thrives at the intersection of quantitative modeling, financial markets, and data-driven problem solving.  
  
Prior to joining the MSCF program, Kevin worked across quantitative research and equity analysis.

His work uncovered momentum-driven features and improved forward return forecasts through machine learning techniques. At China Securities, he implemented and backtested a pairs trading strategy on leading banks, generating insights into excess return potential and risk-adjusted performance. In a previous role at China Capital Management, Kevin conducted industry research on the technology and industrials sectors, evaluating acquisition targets and presenting findings to senior management.
