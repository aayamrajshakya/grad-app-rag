# Apply to MSPM
Are you ready to ignite your product management career?
We give equal consideration to every aspect of your application — goals, background, accomplishments — in order to determine if the Master of Science in Product Management (MSPM) program is a good fit for you.
Your MSPM application will contain a variety of components that provide the admissions committee information to assess your candidacy for our program. Through our review process, we do not assign specific weights to the various parts of the application.
How to Prepare for the Admission Process
The standard admissions expectations for the Tepper School's masters programs will apply, such as transcripts, recommendations, essays, and exams with optional waivers. For MSPM, additionally, we encourage applicants to approach the application process with a focused product perspective.
As you apply, think like a product manager!
If you have doubts about whether to take the GMAT or GRE, then it is best to do so. If your past academic and professional accomplishments speak for themselves, then you may find that requesting a waiver is the better path.
If you are unfamiliar with coding or it has been a long time since you practiced, then an introductory or refresher course would be an excellent way to prepare.

You'll only need about 30 minutes to complete the entire online application form. We provide a time estimate at the top of each page in the online application.
Note to All MSPM Applicants: To safeguard the integrity of the admissions process, Carnegie Mellon University routinely uses a third-party company, Re Vera, to conduct verification procedures of all candidates who accept our offer of admission.
###  Resume
Upload a copy of your resume. The purpose of this document is to provide a snapshot of your education and professional achievements in your career. Use a standard (i.e. Times New Roman or Arial), 12-pt. font for your 1-2 page resume.
###  Education Requirement and Transcripts
##### Education Requirements
Students are required to hold a four-year undergraduate degree or equivalent from an accredited institution.
While there are no additional educational requirements, if you have questions about our typical class profile and experience, contact our admissions team at mspm@cmu.edu.
##### Transcripts
Transcripts uploaded during the application process are considered “unofficial.” What makes a transcript "unofficial" is that you have it in your possession instead of us receiving it in a sealed, stamped envelope directly from your university.
All candidates are required to upload legible, scanned/digitized copies of their unofficial transcripts, not web transcripts*, and degree certificates which include the following:
  * University Transcripts:
  * Degree Name:
  * Degree Conferral Date: 
  * Degree Certificate: [See sample degree certificates](https://apply.tepper.cmu.edu/Diploma_Degree%20Certificate%20Guide_FT19.pdf).
  * Grading Scale:[See sample grading scales](https://apply.tepper.cmu.edu/Grade%20Scale%20Guide.pdf).
  * Official Translation:

A couple of important points:
  * GMAT and GRE scores are valid for five years. Yours must still be valid when you submit your application.

###  English Language Proficiency Exam (TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo DET)
Candidates are required to demonstrate a level of competence in English to meet the admissions requirements of the university. You are required to take a TOEFL, IELTS, or Duolingo exam unless:
  * You attended an undergraduate institution, earning a bachelor’s degree, where the sole language of instruction was English.
  * You earned a graduate degree where the sole language of instruction was English. (Although not required, we do recommend that you take the English Language Proficiency exam.)


You must request that the official score be sent from the testing agency to our program for us to verify the score entered into the application. Request that the official score be sent to us using the following codes:
[TOEFL](http://www.ets.org/toefl) Program Code: 
  * The recommended TOEFL score is 25 on each section of the Internet-based test. Reading: 25, Listening: 25, Speaking: 25, Writing: 25


[IELTS](http://www.ielts.org/) Program Code: 
  * The recommended IELTS score is 7 overall and 7 in each band. Listening: 7, Reading: 7, Writing: 7, Speaking: 7, Overall Band: 7


[Duolingo](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/applicants%20) Program Code: 
  * The recommended Duolingo English Test (DET) score is 120 overall.


TOEFL and IELTS scores are valid for two years and must be valid at the time you submit your application.
If you earned a degree from a non-U.S. institution, your academic documents should state that the sole language of instruction for the entire university was English in order to be eligible for a TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo waiver. If your academic documents don’t include this, you should upload an official letter from the University Registrar indicating English as the mode of instruction for the entirety of the degree.
###  Essays
There are two required essays
  1. The Tepper community is dynamic and unique with students who strive to be collaborative, supportive and inclusive. Please provide an example of when you experienced or created an inclusive environment and how you will use that experience to help members of the community reach their full potential.
  2. Share a time you made a mistake at work. Provide context that you feel would adequately describe how you felt when this occurred, what you did when you realized the mistake and what, if anything, did you learn from this experience.


Optional essay:
###  Video Essay: Goals
We know this is an important component of your decision to attend business school. We take it seriously as well. Please describe your post-MSPM career goals and why you chose them as your goals.
It would be helpful to consider the following information in your response:
  * You have up to 2 minutes to respond to this question.
  * Please be as specific as possible. If you have not yet identified specific companies, that is okay. Just tell us what interests you for your next role or company. What about the industry, company, or functional role is appealing to you?
  * If you have any criteria you are using to evaluate career opportunities, please share those as well. We may have great opportunities to add to your list.
  * How does this post-MSPM career goal relate to your long-term career plan?


###  Professional Recommendations
Please select two people familiar with your work and/or leadership skill. We prefer that you select supervisors, but you can also include professors, coaches, mentors, or coworkers. Please give us their email contact information on your application, and we’ll reach out to them with a request to submit their letters online.
We use the GMAC Common Letter of Recommendation (LOR). The Common LOR is intended to save you and your recommender valuable time by providing a single set of recommendation questions for each participating school. This allows your recommender to use the same answers for multiple letter submissions, alleviating the workload of having to answer different questions for each school multiple times. You benefit because it makes the ask for several different letters to be written on your behalf much easier.
###  Application Fee
A non-refundable
###  Supporting Documentation
Once you have completed your online application, if you have any supporting documents, they should be uploaded directly to your application via your application status page in the application portal.
If you have submitted all the application components, it isn’t necessary to send anything else to us at this point. Upon admission, you’ll need to send your official transcripts/academic documents. These details will be included in the admission letter, so no need to worry about it now.
###  Evaluative Interview
Admissions interviews are granted at the discretion of the admissions committee after an initial review of your application. You will receive additional information about the interview process at the time of the invitation.
