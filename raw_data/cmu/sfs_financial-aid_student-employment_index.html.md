# Student Employment
There are many student employment opportunities on campus, both need-based and non-need based. On-campus employment can help students pay for tuition and educational expenses, and it's a great way for students to earn extra spending money or savings while enrolled. In addition, students will develop professional skills that will prove to be beneficial for future job searches.
Students may search and apply for on- and off-campus jobs and internships through [Handshake](https://cmu.joinhandshake.com/login).

Federal Work-Study (FWS) is a need-based self-help award. If a student has been awarded FWS, the FWS award is the total that can be earned during the academic year as a work-study student. It is important to note that funds earned in the Federal Work-Study Program are not credited to the student's account.
All students who are employed by Carnegie Mellon submit their hours worked in [WorkDay](http://www.cmu.edu/my-workday-toolkit/) and are paid by check on a bi-weekly basis. Students have the option to have their pay direct deposited into a local checking or savings account.
Most students are paid directly by their employers. Others are paid with a combination of federal and university funds through the Federal Work-Study program, which includes a component for Community Service Federal Work-Study.

## Required Employment Eligibility Verification (Form I-9)
Planning to work at CMU? Employment eligibility verification is required.
Form I-9 must be completed within three business days 
To ensure compliance with federal law, Carnegie Mellon University maintains the [Employment Eligibility Verification (I-9) Policy (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/hr/restrict/employment-eligibility-verification-policy.pdf) covering the university's I-9 and E-Verify Requirements: 
  * Every individual receiving a stipend from CMU or employed by CMU must comply with the I-9 Policy by completing the Form I-9 within three business days of stipend start date/employment.
  * Individuals who expect to work on a federally funded project are further responsible for submitting an E-Verify Processing Request Form to the Office of Human Resources. 


For more information, please see CMU's [Guidance for Completing the Form I-9 and E-Verify Requirements at CMU (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/recruiting/restrict/i-9-guidance.pdf) or visit the Human Resources website to[ learn more](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/service-center/new-faculty-staff/i-9-e-verify/index.html) about Form I-9 and E-Verify and to [schedule an appointment](https://go.oncehub.com/I9Appointment) to complete Form I-9. 
## Pennsylvania Act 32 / Local Earned Income Tax
PA Act 32 requires Carnegie Mellon to collect Earned Income Tax (EIT) on behalf of its employees - including student employees - for the local municipality in which they live or work.
Students who are employed by Carnegie Mellon in Pennsylvania are required to take action to ensure that the amount of tax withheld is correct and that the tax is disbursed correctly according to the tax residency address. All employees who live in or work in the state of Pennsylvania are required to complete a Local Earned Income Tax Certification form. If this form is not completed and signed, then the employee's local tax withholding may be incorrect.
After the student employee completes an I-9, the Local Earned Income Tax Certification form will appear in the Workday inbox for completion and a signature. For questions, contact cmu-works@andrew.cmu.edu. 
## Federal Work-Study Restrictions on Political Activities
Under updated federal guidance, students may not be employed in any Federal Work-Study (FWS) position that involves partisan or nonpartisan political activity. This includes:  

  * Voter registration efforts (even if nonpartisan)
  * Assisting voters at polling places or through hotlines
  * Serving as a poll worker
  * Any work that supports the voting process or serves the interests of a particular political group

These activities are considered political in nature and are not eligible for FWS funding. FWS jobs must focus on providing real-world work experience and must not involve political engagement of any kind.
