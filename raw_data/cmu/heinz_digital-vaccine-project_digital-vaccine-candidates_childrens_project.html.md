  * Objective:


  * Methodology:


This study will utilize a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) design with two arms: a treatment group using the fooyaD!™ mobile app video game and a control group receiving standard care. The study will involve a total of 80 participants, aged 6-12 years, with 40 participants in each arm. Recruitment will be conducted from the patient population served by the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh (CHP).
  * Desired Outcome Measures:


The primary outcome measures encompass alterations in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c, glucose variability, time within the target glucose range, and trends in hypoglycemia patterns. Secondary outcome measures involve shifts in food consumption, food choices, physical activity levels, and T1D-specific knowledge among both participants and their parents. Game play patterns will be meticulously examined through the analysis of telemetry data.
