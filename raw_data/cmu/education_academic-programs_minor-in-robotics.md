# Concentration in Robotics
## This concentration is available to SCS students only.
The SCS Robotics Concentration provides an opportunity for SCS undergraduate students at Carnegie Mellon to learn the principles and practices of robotics through theoretical studies and hands-on experience with robots. Students initially learn the basics of robotics in an introductory robotics overview course. Additional required courses teach control systems and robotic kinematics. Students also choose from a wide selection of electives in mobile systems, machine learning, computer vision, cognition and cognitive science, or computer graphics. Students have a unique opportunity to undertake independent research projects, working under the guidance of Robotics Institute faculty members; this provides an excellent introduction to robotics practice, for those considering industry and research for those considering graduate studies.
### Rules and Policies for the Robotics Concentration
  * Courses used to satisfy the requirements for the Robotics Concentration may not
  * Students must complete a minimum of 27 unitsnot
  * A maximum of two courses
  * The Robotics Concentration is supported by a dedicated advisor; for questions, contact Samantha Bridge at sbridge@andrew.cmu.edu.
