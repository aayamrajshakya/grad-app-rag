## Bio
Yi-tsen is a Ph.D. student in Behavioral Decision Research at SDS. Her work explores how information shapes decision making in uncertain environments, with a particular interest in belief formation and updating. She is also drawn to k-level reasoning in strategic interactions, focusing on how individuals form and respond to higher-order beliefs. More recently, she has been studying complexity in decision environments, examining why people sometimes move away from careful deliberation and instead rely on intuition.
