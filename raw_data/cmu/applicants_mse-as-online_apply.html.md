# Apply Now
All aspects of the candidate's packet are given equal weight and consideration. No single admission criterion overshadows another; rather, it is the composite of all of the application materials that determines the admission decision. The ability to perform graduate-level work, a solid undergraduate background in computer science or related disciplines, software development maturity, and industry experience are several factors considered for admission. In some cases, excellence and promise can balance a lack of formal preparation.

## MSE Online Application Materials
The following materials are required with your online application:
  1. Statement of Purpose:[six key practice areas](https://mse.s3d.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-as-online/practice-areas.html) in software engineering, and describe a challenge you experienced at work, and what the preferred outcome was, or what you would like to have changed and (2) specifics about your professional goals.
  2. Resume/CV 
  3. Letters of Recommendation: 
  4. Video Essay: 
  5. Unofficial Transcripts: 
  6. Unofficial GRE Scores (optional):
  7. Unofficial Language Exam Scores:  
  
We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS, or Duolingo. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China," since speaking is not scored. Should you choose to use Duolingo, we may reach out to you after you submit your application to set up a video interview as well. Do not send official score reports at this time.  
  
_We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English._ In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.   
  
Submit valid, recent scores  

     * If you have not received a bachelor’s degree in the U.S., you will need to submit an English proficiency score no older than two years. (Scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2023, will not be accepted.)
     * If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S., you may submit an expired test score up to five years old. (Scores from exams taken before Sept. 1, 2020, will not be accepted.)
  8. Online Coding Assessment:   
  
This test is only an assessment, students are accepted with both strong and weak programming ability. Any evidence of cheating will result in rejection of the application.

# FAQ
##### Can I apply for an application fee waiver? 
Fee waivers are available for financial hardship or participants in certain organizations. You are able to submit a waiver request in the application after it is created. The deadline to submit a waiver request is one week before the application deadline.
#####    
  
Once I’ve completed all requirements, will my degree say “online?”
No, MSE Online students’ degrees will read “Master of Science – Software Engineering.”
##### Should I send official transcripts and score reports?
If accepted into the program, you will receive instructions for submitting official transcripts and test scores (if applicable). Please note that official documents cannot be tracked or accepted during the initial application process. You only need to provide official transcripts and test scores after being admitted to the program and receiving instructions.
##### How do I calculate my years of experience?
The cutoff date to use in your calculation is the month in which this application is due (October for Spring starts and May for Fall starts). For example, if you started working at a company in March 2021 and you currently work there and intend to continue working there until classes begin in January 2025, you would calculate the start date as March 2021 and the end date as October 2024. You would report on the application that you worked at the company for 3 years, 7 months.
##### Should I include internships in my years of experience calculation?
It is reasonable to include software engineering internships in your calculation as long as the internship was with a legitimate company and led to an increase of knowledge in software engineering.
##### Is there an application fee?
Yes, the application fee is $100.
##### Can I see a sample SOP?
Although we do not provide samples, we do have guidelines [pdf] which you should read before you start writing your SOP.
