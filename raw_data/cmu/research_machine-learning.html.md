As the world of “big data” gradually becomes a world of “bigger data,” Carnegie Mellon University CyLab researchers are focused on advancing research in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), in which computers can “learn” trends from massive collections of data. This research is being conducted and tested in various applications ranging from facial recognition to systems that can autonomously find and fix software bugs before they are exploited.
