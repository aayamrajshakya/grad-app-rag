## Bio
How does an elite athlete and music artist become a top quant trader?  
  
I'm Romain Foucault, pursuing an MSc in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. My goal is to become a Quantitative Trader at a leading hedge fund or trading firm, combining advanced quantitative methods with my competitive drive and creative approach to consistently deliver financial results.  
  
My academic training in data science, mathematics, and finance at Mines de Paris and Albert School equips me with critical quant trading skills. I have won several quantitative competitions, notably Edmond de Rothschild in Paris, where I crafted NLP-driven strategies, increasing portfolio Sharpe ratios by 6%. At Pictet in Geneva, as an AI engineer intern, I developed AI-driven financial tools that reduced analytical latency by 95%, giving a significant edge for quant strategists and traders.  
  
Beyond finance, I am a former French national athletics champion and a former music artist with over 60 million streams, demonstrating my discipline, creativity, and resilience under pressure-qualities essential for high-stakes trading.  
  
I'm available to meet virtually or in person to discuss how my analytical skills and unique background can immediately benefit your team.
