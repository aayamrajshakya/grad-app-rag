Our Mechanics, chemistry, and materials (MCM) focus area looks at modeling, predicting, and engineering complex behaviors in both synthetic and natural materials to address pressing societal needs related to sustainability, infrastructure renewal, public safety, and the generation of food, energy, and clean water.
## MCM education
Understanding the connection between mechanics, chemistry, and materials involves mastering fundamental mechanisms like deformation, failure, flow, reaction, and transformation. Our program provides a strong foundation in physical sciences, mathematical methods, numerical techniques, and advanced topics such as structural mechanics, continuum mechanics, and environmental chemistry.
Students will sharpen their practical skills with courses in computer programming, data science, materials synthesis, and characterization. This broad professional toolkit prepares you for diverse career paths, whether designing earthquake-resistant buildings, developing sustainable materials, or innovating in environmental remediation and greenhouse gas capture.
Working with your faculty mentor, you'll customize your coursework to match your academic and career goals, allowing for both broad exploration and specialized focus in key areas.
### MCM students can specialize in one of two tracks:
  * Mechanics, materials, and structures
  * Chemistry and materials

## MCM research
## Example research projects
* ### Topological Defects and Pattern Formation
This project aims to develop a mathematical framework for describing topological defects, critical in understanding pattern formation in organized matter, with applications in seismic forecasting and infrastructure renewal.
Faculty: [Amit Acharya](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/acharya-amit.html), [Jerry Wang](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/wang-gerald.html)
* ### Composites Used in Aviation
This collaborative project, funded by the Department of Defense, focuses on enhancing the understanding of carbon fiber composites in aviation through novel computational methods rooted in quantum mechanics. It bridges theoretical chemistry models with practical engineering applications.

* ### Structural Health Monitoring of Windmills
This project leverages improved probabilistic modeling methods to ensure the integrity of windmills for electricity generation in order to promote decreased dependence on fossil fuels and sustainability.
Faculty: [Matteo Pozzi](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/pozzi-matteo.html)
* ### From Discrete Dislocation Dynamics to Crystal Plasticity
This work aims to develop a novel computational tool for accurate multi-scale simulations of plasticity and dislocation microstructure evolution in crystalline materials. The challenge addressed will be the computation of plastic strength and associated material microstructure at the meso and macro scale directly from the underlying motion of crystal defects. This application is a paradigmatic complex system with immense practical relevance.
