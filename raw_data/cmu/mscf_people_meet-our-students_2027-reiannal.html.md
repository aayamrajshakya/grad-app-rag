## Bio
I thrive where decisions are fast, data is noisy, and every move counts. I seek to join a dynamic, intellectually rigorous trading team where I can apply my strengths in data science, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic thinking to develop and refine high-impact trading strategies. I'm excited to contribute to a fast-paced environment, continuously learn from market behavior, and grow into a confident, risk-aware decision-maker. I'm results-driven - I measure what I build, iterate with purpose, and optimize for performance. Technically strong and market-curious, I'm constantly thinking about how to turn complexity into clarity and decisions into edge. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
