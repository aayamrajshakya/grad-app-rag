## Bio
Swarnava graduated from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kharagpur with a B.Tech. in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering and a minor in Computer Science and Engineering, ranking among the top 2% of his peers. His passion for computer science and math led him to build a strong foundation in programming, algorithms, machine learning, big data, linear algebra, probability, and stochastic processes during his undergraduate studies. Over the past two years, Swarnava worked as a software engineer at Oracle, where he leveraged his Python expertise to develop intricate software tools and libraries for Oracle’s global customers. His technical skills, complex problem-solving, and seamless collaboration earned him recognition across his team’s broader organization. Swarnava’s interest in finance and economics grew after taking business courses in college, where he became captivated by their impact on society and the global economy. Intrigued by how financial markets influence global dynamics, he decided to join the MSCF program to create a synergy between his growing passion for finance and his strengths in programming and math. At MSCF, Swarnava aims to combine his creative engineering mindset and programming proficiency while honing best-in-class quantitative and financial skills to create an instant impact in a career in quantitative strategy or research.
