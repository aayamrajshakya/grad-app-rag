## The MIIPS Experience: In Their Own Words
  

_  
_
"The MIIPS program is a chance to prototype yourself, to try new things, experiment, and keep iterating on yourself until you find the direction you want to whether you came from business, design, or engineering."
  

**  
**
"My capstone project with Volvo Mack Trucks was an unforgettable experience that will forever be in my heart. It embodied the soul of the MIIPS program as we managed every product development stage."
  

**  
**
"I had an awesome opportunity to connect with a whole bunch of people who came from different cultures and backgrounds, and just had different strengths and talents as far as both engineerings, business, and design goes."
