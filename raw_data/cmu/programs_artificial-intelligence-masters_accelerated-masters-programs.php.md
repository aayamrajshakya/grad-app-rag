# Accelerated AI Master's Program
* * *
Done faster. Change sooner.
Students with the drive to develop as leaders and enter the job market more quickly can earn their undergraduate and Master of Science in AI Systems Management (AIM) degrees together in five years instead of the typical six.
An accelerated program isn’t just a savings of time. It’s also a considerable savings in cost, and for undergrads coming from outside of Pittsburgh, it offers an expedited path to experience the benefits of two distinct educational and cultural environments, and brings you into contact with the booming Pittsburgh tech sector that much sooner.
