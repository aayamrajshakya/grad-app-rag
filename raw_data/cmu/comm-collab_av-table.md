# Audio-Visual Support
## Reliable Support for Your Classes and Meetings
Our goal is to keep your classes, meetings, and events running smoothly. We provide first-line support for AV equipment in most SCS classrooms and meeting rooms, helping to resolve common issues quickly and reliably.
## Quick Troubleshooting Tips
## Display & Sound
  * Ensure the display/projector is powered on and screen is lowered (if applicable).
  * Confirm the correct input/source is selected.
  * When using a VGA connection, be sure to also connect the audio cable to your laption so sound plays through the system.
  * Check your laptop display settings (duplicate/extend screen).
  * Verify sound is unmuted.
  * Test with another device, if possible.


## Connections & Adapters
  * Verify that all cables are securely connected to the laptop.
  * If using a dongle/adapter, try a different one (Macs work best with Apple adapters).
  * If available, try a different input source (HDMI, USB-C, etc.).
  * Disconnect and reconnect cables, or restart your device if the issue continues
