# US-China Strategic Stability
## Course Number: 84-653 
This course will explore a range of issues that create tension and competition in the US China relationship. As the two countries seek strategic stability and vie to retain or gain advantage in global influence, each country defines its success differently, and in ways that could bring it into conflict with the other. This course will examine key issues in the US-China relationship that create and exacerbate tensions, including Taiwan, cybersecurity, the AI "race", nuclear weapons and long range strike, and scientific cooperation, and technology development.
