## Where Artistry Meets Logistics
Carnegie Mellon’s MFA Stage & Production Management program offers a dynamic blend of comprehensive coursework and extensive production opportunities for aspiring stage and production managers. The program emphasizes collaboration, fostering a tight-knit community where students work closely with peers, faculty, and industry professionals.

### Stage & Production Management Curriculum
Students study and practice both stage and production management, honing their communication and leadership skills alongside their technical and organizational knowledge. Problem-solving, collaboration, and time and resource management are integral parts of the program, as is specialized training in the technological tools available to those working behind the scenes. This intensive curriculum is designed to synthesize academic development and production experience with increased levels of learning as a student progresses.
