## Bio
"How can we use math to forecast financial markets?"  
  
That question has guided my path from research in graph-based LSTMs and topic modelling to projects in recommendation algorithms. I bring a strong foundation in computational mathematics, coding expertise in Python and C++, and hands-on experience building predictive models and optimizing systems under uncertainty.  
  
I aim to join a fast-moving quantitative research or trading team where I can apply my strengths in machine learning, time series forecasting, and financial modeling to generate insights and improve decision-making. I thrive on tough problems and believe my ability to blend theory with implementation sets me apart.  
  
I am available to connect via Zoom or in person to explore how I can contribute to your firm's success.
