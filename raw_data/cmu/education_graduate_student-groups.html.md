“I became involved with GSA early at the urging of a friend and I quickly realized that it was a lot more than throwing a good party. I gained experience serving on campus affairs and external affairs committees and influenced and improved campus policies. It is the most challenging and rewarding thing that I have ever done and I could not get this leadership experience anywhere else.”  
- D. Altintas
## Environment & Water Resources Institute Student Chapter
The [Environment & Water Resources Institute (EWRI) Student Chapter](https://tartanconnect.cmu.edu/ewri/home/) was started in 2011 to advance the knowledge of water resources engineering within the university. Each semester, the EWRI CMU committee organizes seminars, webinars, field trips, conferences, and social events to help students network and build professional skills in the fields of water resources engineering and sustainability. Open to graduate students only. 
## Graduate Student Assembly
The [Graduate Student Assembly (GSA)](http://www.cmu.edu/stugov/gsa/index.html) is a branch of student government that represents all graduate students at Carnegie Mellon. In addition to working with other members of student government, university administration, and external advocacy groups, we plan a variety of social events throughout the year. The GSA is also involved with special funding, dissertation writing groups, and resources for graduate students with families. Open to graduate students only.
