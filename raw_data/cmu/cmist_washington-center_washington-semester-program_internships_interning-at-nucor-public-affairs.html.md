# Interning at Nucor Public Affairs
Alyssa Beeching is majoring in Behavioral Economics and [International Relations and Political Science](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/academics/undergraduate-programs/bachelor-science-international-relations-political-science.html) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). In Fall 2024, she participated in the [Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/washington-center/washington-semester-program/index.html) (CMU/WSP), an experiential learning program in which students live, intern, and take classes in Washington, DC. This program is open to CMU undergraduates from any college or major. Every student participates in an internship, which usually involves about twenty-four hours of work a week. Below is an interview with Alyssa about her internship experience at Nucor Public Affairs. Responses have been lightly edited for length and clarity.
What was your favorite part of the internship?
I loved exploring different parts of the city and meeting other people through my work. I was able to meet senators and congressmen as well as visit many different offices and events.
What were some skills that you needed to carry out your duties? What in your CMU experience helped prepare you for success?
Learning professional writing definitely helped. I took a class on [writing for public policy](https://www.cmu.edu/cmist/academics/courses/undergraduate-courses/84250.html) with Professor Bartos that prepared me for the different types of briefs, memos, and other writing pieces I needed to complete.
_How did you develop professionally and personally over the course of your internship?_
I became more confident with making connections and reaching out to people who are more senior in their careers.
How does this internship fit in with your studies at CMU and broader plans for after graduation?
Although lobbying isn't something I see myself doing, I enjoyed exploring something new. One of our CMU/WSP professors stressed that it is just as important to figure out what you don't want to do as well as what you do want to do. This semester was definitely my way of doing that, and I will think about that when I graduate in a year.
