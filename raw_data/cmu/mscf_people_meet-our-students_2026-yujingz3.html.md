## Bio
Yujing (Emily) Zhang graduated from the University of International Business and Economics in 2024 with a Bachelor's degree in Finance. Her passion for mathematics, statistics, and option pricing led her to Columbia University as a visiting student in Financial Engineering in 2022, where she received intensive master’s-level training and earned a GPA of 4.13. Prior to joining the MSCF program, she completed four quantitative internships at investment banks and hedge funds, focusing on derivatives structuring, modeling, pricing, and stock alpha research. These experiences equipped her with transferable and in-depth skills for various quantitative roles. Beyond academics and her career, Emily has demonstrated strong innovation and leadership. She led a Top 6 team (among 500) in the 2024 UBS Financial Data Engineers Challenge, was a finalist in the 2022 Interdisciplinary Contest in Modeling, and developed option pricing software with copyright registration. Emily decided to join the MSCF program to elevate her quantitative skills to an extraordinary level and contribute to the industry by enhancing market efficiency and liquidity. Upon graduation, she aims to pursue a career in Strats and Modeling.
