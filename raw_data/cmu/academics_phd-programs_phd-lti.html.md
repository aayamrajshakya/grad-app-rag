# Ph.D. in Language and Information Technology
The Ph.D. in LTI focuses on developing the next generation of scientific and entrepreneurial leaders. Ph.D. students are expected to publish papers about original research in the most competitive scientific journals and international conference proceedings, and to present their research at conferences and workshops. Most of our Ph.D. graduates become professors and research scientists. Some start their own companies.
The first two years of the Ph.D. program are similar to our MLT program. After the second year, Ph.D. students spend most of their time working closely with their faculty advisor(s) on research that advances the state-of-the-art in computer science.
New Ph.D. requirements took effect for Fall 2025. Two sets of requirements are shown below because students that joined the program before Fall 2025 may graduate under the new requirements; or, at their option, they may choose to graduate under the older requirements (the "grandfather" policy).
## Current Requirements
Students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must:
  * Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses (usually, eight courses), with addtional requirements detailed below;
  * Satisfy proficiencies/qualifiers in writing, presentation, programming and teaching;
  * Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis); and
  * Attend the LTI Colloquium each semester.


The 96 units of graduate courses must fulfill the following requirements:
  * At least 72 units of LTI courses (usually six courses): Must include one class in three out of four Breadth Categories and a course that satisfies the Application Engineering requirement; and
  * At least 24 units of SCS courses (usually two courses).


First and second year Ph.D. students have the option of taking Introduction to Research in Language Technologies instead of the LTI Colloquium, one time.
The Ph.D. handbook provides more information about the requirements.
## Requirements Prior to Fall 2025
Students pursuing a Ph.D. in Language and Information Technologies must:
  * Pass at least 96 units of graduate-level courses (usually, eight courses), with addtional requirements detailed below;
  * Satisfy proficiencies/qualifiers in writing, presentation, programming and teaching;
  * Propose, write and defend a Ph.D. dissertation (thesis); and
  * Attend the LTI Colloquium each semester.


The 96 units of graduate courses must fulfill the following requirements:
  * At least 72 units of LTI courses (usually six courses) and 24 units of SCS courses (usually two courses);
  * At least one class in each Focus Area; and
  * At least two labs in different research areas.


The Fall 2024 Ph.D. handbook provides more information about the requirements.
## Sample Curriculum
A sample five-year schedule is shown below. It is just one of many paths that a student can take through the PhD program. Each breadth category contains several courses, which gives each student some flexibility in how degree requirements are satisfied.

Requirements  
  
The School of Computer Science requires the following for all Ph.D. applications. (Please note, these requirements may change for future application cycles.)
  * GRE scores: GREs are now optional. If you want to submit GRE scores, they must be less than five years old. The GRE Subject Test is not required, but is recommended. Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.
  * TOEFL scores: Required if English is not your native language. No exceptions. These scores may be more than two years old if you have pursued or are pursuing a bachelor's or graduate degree in the United States. (While the TOEFL is preferred, the IELTS test may also be submitted.) Successful applicants will have a minimum TOEFL score of 100. Our Institution Code is 4256; the Department Code is 78.
  * Official transcripts from each university you have attended, regardless of whether you received your degree there.
  * Current resume.
  * Statement of Purpose.
  * Three letters of recommendation.
  * For more details on these requirements, please see the SCS Doctoral Admissions page.

  
  
In addition to the SCS guidelines, the LTI requires:  
  

  * Any outside funding you are receiving must be accompanied by an official award letter.
  * Video Essay (optional, but strongly recommended). You will have 1-3 minutes to record a video of yourself answering a question that we will provide. You will first be able to complete a test video, which will give you instructions and allow you to practice how the recording will work. You can complete more than one test video. Once you are satisfied and have confirmed that you're ready to record your real submission, you will receive a random question and will have 10 (ten) seconds before the video begins recording. You then have up to 3 minutes to speak and can stop recording once you are done speaking. You will be given 3 attempts, and a new question will be provided with each attempt.Note that the video (and audio) must be of the applicant (not a proxy). If there is more than one person in the video, please clarify which person is the applicant. What you do or say is totally up to you as long as you provide the information requested.If all else is equal, an applicant with a video essay will have an advantage over an otherwise identical applicant without a video essay.Again, this is not a required part of the application process, but it's strongly suggested.

  
No incomplete applications will be eligible for consideration.
