Physics, one of the basic sciences, has its origin in the irrepressible human curiosity to explore and understand the natural world. This fundamental urge to discover has led to the detailed understanding of a remarkable variety of physical phenomena. Our knowledge now encompasses the large-scale movement of galaxies, the minute motions within atoms and nuclei, and the complex structure of the assemblies of molecules that make life possible. The spectacular expansion of our comprehension of the physical world forms an impressive part of the intellectual and cultural heritage of our times. The opportunity to add to this heritage is an important source of motivation for young physicists. The application of discoveries in physics to the solution of complex modern technological problems offers a vast field in which physicists make decisive contributions. The interplay of pure and applied physics has always been fruitful and today ensures many rewarding career opportunities for physics students. The deep understanding of the physical world developed by physics majors prepares them for success in a wide variety of careers well beyond physics, from medicine to all the sciences and engineering.
Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate curriculum in physics has been carefully designed to provide a firm knowledge of the basic principles of physics, an appreciation of a wide range of physical problems of current interest, and the capacity to formulate and solve new problems. In addition to classwork and problem solving, the curriculum includes studying physical phenomena in the laboratory. Physics students are strongly encouraged to go beyond the formal theoretical and experimental course work and become involved in research projects under the guidance of individual faculty members.
Students may choose from a variety of degree options. The objectives and requirements for each of these options are described below. Each allows considerable latitude in the choice of electives:
  * [B.S. in Physics](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofphysics/#bsinphysicstext)
  * [B.A. in Physics](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofphysics/#physicsbatext)

Through the judicious choice of elective courses, a double major program combining physics and another discipline can be readily achieved. A minor in physics is also offered for those students who major in other disciplines. The student, with the help of their faculty advisors, can easily build a program that aims at specific career objectives.
  * [Physics as an Additional Major](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofphysics/#doublemajordualdegreetext)
  * [Physics as a Dual Degree](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofphysics/#doublemajordualdegreetext)
  * [Minor in Physics](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/schools-colleges/melloncollegeofscience/departmentofphysics/#minorinphysicstext)


The Department maintains an active and wide-ranging program of advising. Beyond aiding in academic planning, the Director of Undergraduate Affairs can also assist students in finding research work during the academic year, technical jobs and internships for the summer, as well as planning and executing the necessary steps for gaining employment or continuing their studies beyond the bachelor’s degree. Whether students follow a standard curriculum or not, they should consult their academic advisor at least once every semester.

## B.S. in Physics
B.S. degree candidates can choose studies in not only a wide variety of intermediate and advanced topics in physics but also a range of material in other science or engineering fields. The B.S. degree provides a solid foundation for students wishing to go on to graduate work in physics or any of a large number of fields in pure or applied science or engineering for which a sound grasp of physics and mathematics is essential. This program also provides excellent preparation for careers in teaching, for work in industrial or governmental research and development, or for other employment in business or industry with a significant scientific component.
### Degree Requirements
#### Physics Core:
All physics majors take these courses in physics, which are designed to teach the fundamentals required for any specialty. Many students take the 100-level courses in their first year of study, the 200-level courses in their second year, and the 300-level courses in their third or fourth year.

## B.A. in Physics
The Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics offers a flexible program that allows students to combine the study of Physics with the opportunity to do intensive work in substantive areas such as liberal arts, teaching, business or law. With up to 80 units of free electives, it is feasible for students to obtain, for example, an additional major with a department in the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Fine Arts, or the Tepper School of Business. It is expected that students will focus their elective courses in a well-defined academic area. Students must meet with the Director of Undergraduate Affairs and construct an approved plan of study.
The requirements for the B.A. degree are the same as for the B.S. degree, except that 6 of the Physics, Mathematics and Technical Electives in the B.S. program become Free Electives in the B.A. program. These requirements are listed below.

### Biological Physics Track
The B.S. in Physics/Biological Physics Track combines a rigorous foundation in undergraduate physics with courses in Biological Physics and Chemistry. It is particularly suitable for students preparing for post-baccalaureate careers in the expanding areas of biological and medical physics or for graduate study in biophysics. The program is sufficiently flexible that it can be readily adapted to the requirements of individual students. The student will first meet with the Director of Undergraduate Affairs to discuss interests and career goals and then choose electives that fulfill the requirements of the track.
The Biological Physics Track is excellent preparation for Medical School. All courses suggested for medical school applicants can be completed within this track. Students interested in both the Biological Physics Track and the pre-medical program should consult with both the Director of Undergraduate Affairs in the Physics Department and the Director of the Health Professions Program for help in planning their programs.

Students may choose to complete the B.A. or the B.S. in Physics, with or without a track. Students must complete both the technical and non-technical requirements, and should consult with the Director of Undergraduate Affairs for questions about double counting. The number of total units required to earn a Dual Degree is 90 more than the total units required by the department requiring the fewer total units. Since Physics requires 360 units, the lowest possible minimum for a Dual Degree with Physics is 450 units.
## Minor in Physics
The Minor in Physics is designed to provide a solid foundation in physics at the introductory level, followed by elective courses which will familiarize the student with areas of modern physics and the concepts and techniques employed therein. The physics minor requires seven courses of at least 9 units each, of which four are prescribed and three are electives.
The minor is open to all students in the university, but students with non-calculus-based majors should be aware of the mathematics requirements for many physics courses ([21-120](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=21-120 "21-120"), [21-122](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=21-122 "21-122"), and [21-259](http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/search/?P=21-259 "21-259")). Students are required to have successfully completed at least one physics course at Carnegie Mellon before declaring the minor, and should declare the minor no later than the add date of their final semester. Interested students should contact Dr. Gillian Ryan, Director of Undergraduate Affairs, and complete the[ minor declaration form](https://www.cmu.edu/mcs/undergrad/advising/forms/mcs_additional_major-minor.pdf) with her assistance.

## Transfer Credit Requests
Requests for transfer credit for undergraduate physics classes should be made through the student’s home college to the Director of Undergraduate Affairs. Students should contact their primary departmental academic advisor for the transfer request process in their college. Requests should not 
#### Criteria for Transfer
In assessing the suitability of courses for transfer credit, the Department of Physics will consider the following factors: 
  * The academic rigor of the course must be comparable to that offered at Carnegie Mellon University. This is usually assessed via the course prerequisites and corequisites, the textbook used, and the amount of time spent on topic areas. The Department of 
  * The mathematical rigor of a course must also be comparable to that for the CMU course for which a transfer is requested. For example, a class that has no math prerequisite will not transfer as a CMU class for which there is such a prerequisite, and algebra-based Physics I or Physics II classes will not be accepted for transfer as our calculus-based courses.
  * The topic areas of a given class and time devoted to each topic should match to a degree of at least 80% those covered in the comparable physics course at Carnegie Mellon University, although this criterion alone is not sufficient to merit transfer. Classes that meet this criterion may still be denied transfer credit if key topics are found to be excluded or are not covered in sufficient depth to satisfy the Department's requirements regarding rigor. 


#### Requirements for Transfer Requests
The Department of Physics requires all the following materials to determine if transfer is recommended:
  * Name of course and its home institution
  * Number of credits/units/contact hours per week 
  * Course syllabus
  * Official catalog course description and list of topics covered in the course
  * A list of all prerequisite and corequisite courses, and official catalog course descriptions of these courses 
  * Required textbook (name, author, and link to information about the text required)


Transfer requests that do not include all information above will not be recommended.
## Course Descriptions
##### About Course Numbers:
Each Carnegie Mellon course number begins with a two-digit prefix that designates the department offering the course (i.e., 76-xxx courses are offered by the Department of English). Although each department maintains its own course numbering practices, typically, the first digit after the prefix indicates the class level: xx-1xx courses are freshmen-level, xx-2xx courses are sophomore level, etc. Depending on the department, xx-6xx courses may be either undergraduate senior-level or graduate-level, and xx-7xx courses and higher are graduate-level. Consult the Schedule of Classes each semester for course offerings and for any necessary pre-requisites or co-requisites.

These laws are applied to deduce relationships among heat capacities and other measurable quantities and then are generalized to open systems and their various auxiliary thermodynamic potentials; transformations between potentials are developed. Criteria for equilibrium of multicomponent systems are developed and applied to phase transformations and chemical reactions. Models of solutions are obtained by using statistical mechanics and are applied to deduce simple phase diagrams for ideal and regular solutions. The concept of thermodynamic stability is then introduced and illustrated in the context of phase transformations.

33-342 Thermal Physics II
    Spring: 10 units  
This course begins with a more systematic development of formal probability theory, with emphasis on generating functions, probability density functions and asymptotic approximations. Examples are taken from games of chance, geometric probabilities and radioactive decay. The connections between the ensembles of statistical mechanics (microcanonical, canonical and grand canonical) with the various thermodynamic potentials is developed for single component and multicomponent systems. Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics are reviewed. These principles are then applied to applications such as electronic specific heats, Einstein condensation, chemical reactions, phase transformations, mean field theories, binary phase diagrams, paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, defects, semiconductors and fluctuation phenomena.

These target spaces are typically Lie Groups. A classic example of such a system is the rigid rotator, where every configuration of the system is a point on the manifold which defines the group of rotations. The purpose of this class will be to learn the basics of differential geometry and apply these ideas to physical systems. Topics will include Hamiltonian dynamics, fluid mechanics as well as gauge theories. Requirements: Knowledge of Linear Algebra. No prior knowledge of group theory will be expected.

Biological physics, or the physics of living systems, is an exciting interdisciplinary frontier of physics that aims to understand the phenomenon of life using concepts and tools from Physics. This intermediate level course will introduce the general concepts and principles underpinning the physical behavior of living systems, from the dynamics of proteins and molecules to collective behavior of living cells and organisms. The course will develop key physics concepts that are most vital to biological processes, including energy conversion, information transfer, mechanics of movement, statistical phenomena, and fluid flow. We will apply these physics concepts to demonstrate how biological systems function, build simplified mathematical models to predict behavior, and use experimental data to inform and test models. The integration of biological phenomena, physical concepts, mathematical modeling, and analysis of experimental data represents an entirely new mode of learning, based on strategies adopted in research. These strategies will break traditional disciplinary barriers between physics and biology. The students will be expected to gain an intuitive grasp of ways to: frame the physical problem, identify appropriate theoretical frameworks, analyze experimental data, and ways to generalize and to understand the dependence of biophysical phenomenon on time and length scales. No prior knowledge of biology is expected. This class is offered in Fall of even years (e.g. Fall '24, 26, etc.)

    Spring: 9 units  
This course gives a quantitative description of crystal lattices, common crystal structures obtained by adding a basis of atoms to the lattice, and the definition and properties of the reciprocal lattice. Diffraction measurements are studied as tools to quantify crystal lattices, including Bragg's law and structure factors. Diffraction from amorphous substances and liquids is also introduced. The various types of atomic bonding, e.g., Van der Waals, metallic, ionic, covalent and hydrogen are surveyed. Binding energies of some crystalline structures are calculated. Models of crystal binding are generalized to include dynamics, first for classical lattice vibrations and then for quantized lattice vibrations known as phonons. These concepts are used to calculate the heat capacities of insulating crystals, to introduce the concept of density of states, and to discuss phonon scattering. The band theory of solids is developed, starting with the free electron model of a metal and culminating with the properties of conductors and semiconductors. Magnetic phenomena such as paramagnetism and the mean field theory of ferromagnetism are covered to the extent that time permits.
