# Sound Design
## Ideas That Resonate
Carnegie Mellon’s sound design program invites students to imagine the future of sound in entertainment, and prepares them for careers as sound designers, system engineers, mixers, dialog and effects editors, music supervisors, coders, and audio technicians. With two dedicated sound design faculty and our strong alumni community that works extensively in the field, students are well-positioned to enter the industry upon graduation.
### Sound Design Curriculum
The sound design curriculum focuses equally on conceptual design, composition, and system design. Students have access to facilities outfitted with a wide range of analog and digital equipment, from tape recorders to networked audio systems. The school’s ambitious production season gives students a wide range of opportunities to put their design and technical skills into practice.
