# Foundational Degree Comparisons
TheEST&P degree offers an intensive interdisciplinary experience of programmatic core, engineering depth, and customizable breadth in energy that is completed in two semesters. The EST&P - Advanced Study degree extends a student's experience over a third semester through customizable advanced study involving 36 units of depth in either energy projects, data science courses, or another engineering discipline. 
The two Foundational Degrees are illustrated using puzzle graphics below, which aim to highlight how the distinct components of the degrees fit to a larger whole, and to indicate the flexibility in designing a degree that fits your individual career goals.
