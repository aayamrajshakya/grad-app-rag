# Language and Cross-cultural Support
Language Support assists multilingual learners in meeting their English language learning goals through one-to-one speaking appointments and conversation groups.  
  

## ITA Certification
CLS is also charged with International Teaching Assistant (ITA) Certification as required by university policy and Pennsylvania law. If a student for whom English is an additional language has a teaching appointment, they will need to be certified, a process initiated by the hiring department. Faculty and staff who oversee ITAs may email Jennifer Kenna (jkenna@andrew.cmu.edu), Assistant Director of Language Support Initiatives, for more information.
  * [Apply for ITA Certification](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_G_L4BH8y8eShyX7hyf9ZZvGpKajCgf2HPg-k0dpC4k105g/viewform)


In order to create a welcoming environment for the entire campus community, we have some additional resources. If you are a faculty member, staff member, or visitor needing language support, please contact Kristin Messuri✉, Director of Communication and Language Support Development, for university resources. 
  
Communication and Language Support is excited to offer our Conversation Group program again this semester. Our Conversation Groups are designed to give you the opportunity to practice speaking English in a fun and casual environment, discuss language and culture, and connect with other students from different programs at CMU.  
  
We also have social events throughout the semester where all the group members can come together to hang out and participate in various activities. If you are interested in joining an ongoing group, [please fill out the registration form here](https://forms.gle/hqtqR8CncxhKqNs6A). If all the groups are full, you will be placed on a waitlist and contacted as spots become available.   
Please feel free to reach out to success@andrew.cmu.edu with any questions.
