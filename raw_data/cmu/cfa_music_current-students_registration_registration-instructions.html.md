The expectations are identical between the two classes. The difference is that 57-101 has three times the class time to cover the same material as 57-171. The pace of 57-171 is fast; there is just enough time to cover the minimum requirements for the assignments. The pace of 57-101 is slower; there is more time to cover an additional side lesson or two, and usually time for open lab and questions.
The recommendation is to not take 57-171 unless you fit certain criteria: you have previous experience with some of the software involved; you generally are very strong with computer technology, pick up skills quickly AND have some musical training; you cannot take the course during the other section times. If you're unsure, register for 57-101.
