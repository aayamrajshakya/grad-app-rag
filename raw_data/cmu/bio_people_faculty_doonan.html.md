On March 21stnd
Students were instructed on sterile lab technique before working at the lab bench. The students performed a transformation experiment where they made bacterial cells competent through an incubation in calcium chloride. Next, they transformed their competent bacteria with a control plasmid and plasmid pLUX (containing the luciferase gene from the marine fish, Vibrio fisheri
After a recovery period, the plasmid-transformed bacterial cells were spread on agar plates. The day ended with the lead instructors reviewing the transformation experiment, and discussing the experimental outcomes. The students transported their agar plates back to their school for analysis. In the next days, the students assessed the pLux plasmid transformed bacteria for glow in the dark colonies.
Dr. Carrie Doonan coordinated the experiment. Dr. McGuier provided the introduction, and facilitated the outreach. Lead Instructors were Dr. Emily Drill, and Dr. Natalie McGuier.
