## Materials computation and informatics
Computational modeling supports materials discovery, development, and manufacturing over the range of materials systems. Physical simulations reveal materials behavior at every length scale, from electrons to microstructure to engineered systems.
As the methods of data science and machine learning advance, we apply them to extract knowledge from our rich and complex data sets. 
Our tools include a range of computers, from laptops to supercomputers. Our methods reveal the behavior of materials from integrated circuits to artificial organs.
