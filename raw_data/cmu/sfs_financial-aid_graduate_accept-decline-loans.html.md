# Accept, Reduce or Decline Loans
In order for any financial aid funds (scholarships and/or loans) to be applied to your student account, you must accept or decline all federal loans included in your financial aid offer. The amount of offered loan funds may also be reduced. The process is simple:
  * Log in to your My Student Aid portal with your Andrew ID and password
  * Select 'Display Now' in the 'My Financial Aid Offer' box
  * Select the 'Contribution Planning' button to accept, decline or reduce your loans 
    * If you accept your loan, you will need to sign a [Master Promissory Note and complete Entrance Counseling](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/types/federal/direct/mpn-entrance-counseling.html) if you haven't completed these in previous years.


**In order for any scholarship and loan funds to be applied to your student account in a timely manner, it is important to complete all of the steps above as soon as possible.**
