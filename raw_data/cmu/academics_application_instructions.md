## Test Scores: GRE
#### GRE Requirements
Each program sets its policy on whether Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required and which test type is accepted. You will find this information in the application and on the program's website. GRE scores will not be accepted if they are more than five years old. Send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:
  * GRE Institution Code: 2074
  * GRE Department Code: 0402


If you have taken the GRE more than once, enter the scores from your most recent test. All scores will appear on the official score report for the committee to review.
#### Timing
If you need to take or retake your GRE for this application, we highly recommend that you take the exam no later than November 26, 2025. Reportable scores can take two weeks to process, and we may not be able to review scores that arrive after our December 10, 2025, deadline.
## Test Scores: English Language Proficiency
#### Evaluation Requirements (if applicable)
If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you ("native language" meaning spoken at home and from birth), then we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency via one of these standardized tests:
  * TOEFL (preferred)
  * IELTS
  * Duolingo


We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English.
Some of our programs will accept expired test scores from applicants who have recently completed a degree in the United States if the applicant can present a copy of an official score report showing the applicant's picture, not an unofficial score listing. Please consult the information for each specific program you apply to.
If, as described above, you are required to submit proof of English proficiency, your TOEFL, IELTS or Duolingo test scores will be considered valid as follows:
  * If you have not received a bachelor's degree in the U.S.
  * If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or a master's degree in the U.S.ETS does not hold scores that are over two years old; in this case, you may upload a PDF of your expired score to your application. Be sure that the expired scores meet our requirements.
  * If you are applying to MCDS and MHCI[MCDS](https://mcds.cs.cmu.edu/apply-mcds-program)[MHCI](https://www.hcii.cmu.edu/academics/mhci/admissions)


#### Timing
If you need to take or retake one of these tests, we highly recommend that you take the exam no later than November 26, 2025. Reportable scores can take two weeks to process, and we may not be able to review scores that arrive after our December 10, 2025, deadline.

#### Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
We accept TOEFL iBT and TOEFL iBT Special Home Edition scores. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China," since speaking is not scored. A successful applicant will typically have a total iBT score of at least 100. Send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:
  * TOEFL Institution Code: 4256
  * TOEFL Department Code: 78


* * *
#### International English Language Testing System (IELTS)
We prefer that you take the TOEFL, but we will accept the IELTS. An IELTS score of 7 is equivalent to a TOEFL score of 100. We accept IELTS scores through e-delivery; enter the information below when setting up your scores for delivery:
  * Account Name: Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science
  * Address:   
School of Computer Science  
5000 Forbes Avenue  
Pittsburgh, PA 15213   
United States

#### Duolingo
We prefer that you take the TOEFL or IELTS; if this isn't possible, then you may take the Duolingo test. Visit the [Duolingo website](https://englishtest.duolingo.com/scores) to see a score comparison. For score delivery:
  * Use the same email address as the one you plan to use when applying to a CMU program.
  * Send Duolingo scores to "Carnegie Mellon University – Graduate Computer Science Programs."
  * Important:


## Unofficial Transcripts
Transcripts must be uploaded prior to application submission. We do not require hard copies of your transcripts at the time of application; if you are accepted to a program, then you will be given instructions to mail your transcripts at that time.
We do not require you to upload your fall semester grades.e will not update your transcripts after you receive them. Since fall grades are not required, we recommend uploading your transcripts as early as possible.
## Resume / CV
You will be asked to submit your current resume. It should outline your education, research experience, work experience, publications, scholarships awarded, prizes and honors received, society memberships and any other extracurricular activities.
## Statement of Purpose
Each program has specific requirements for the Statement of Purpose, detailed on the application.
Generally: 
  * You should prepare a concise one- or two-page essay that describes your research interests, related experiences and objectives in pursuing a graduate degree at Carnegie Mellon.
  * Your essay should be specific. Explain why your research interests are important areas of study and why you are particularly well-suited to pursue them.
  * You should describe any relevant education, research, commercial, government or teaching experience.


Our review committees value applicants who display persistence and resilience in the face of challenge and adversity, demonstrate a commitment to ethics, show concern for others and for their community, and/or exhibit leadership in one or more endeavors.
We recommend that you use AI tools only in a limited fashion. They are great for correcting grammar and spelling; they are terrible for expressing your own interests and experiences. Remember that you are solely responsible for 100% of what is submitted in your application. Please consider carefully how you use these tools as the use of them may impact your ability to be admitted.
## Letters of Recommendation
You are required to submit three
#### Selecting your recommenders
  * Recommenders should know you relatively well and be able to evaluate the quality of your previous work. At least two letters should be from faculty or recent employers.
  * The admissions committee wants to know about your ability to do independent research, so you should select letter writers who can speak best to this point.
  * Professors who interacted with you extensively in smaller classes are also a good choice.
  * Employers are sometimes appropriate, but letters that are simply character references will not provide good support for your application.


#### Timing
  * If you submit your application early, your recommenders still have until the final deadline to submit their letters.
  * If the application deadline is approaching, and one or more letters of recommendation are still pending, do not wait to submit your application. We prefer that your recommenders meet the deadline, but it is okay if the letters arrive a few days late.
