# Degree Comparisons
EST&P is a professional master's degree program oriented towards career preparation of engineers and scientists who have a passion for leading society's energy future. Each of the four MS degrees are awarded for successful completion of their required coursework. The degrees are grouped into two categories: (I) the two Foundational Degrees and (II) the two Applied Study Degrees. The educational requirements for the degrees are compared in Tables ( [Foundational](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/foundational-table.html) / [Applied](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/applied-study-table.html "Applied Study Table") ) and the interconnectedness of the degree components compared in Puzzle Graphics ( [Foundational](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/foundational-puzzle.html) / [Applied](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/estp/degree-programs/degree-comparisons/applied-study-puzzle.html "Applied Study Puzzle") ) in the linked pages. Two simple differentiations of the degrees are given in the table below, which lays out the degree programs **by the** **number of semesters** **required** (columns) to complete each program and **whether or not a** **summer internship is required** (rows). 
**Degree**  
**Programs** |  **Required Semesters**  
---|---  
**Two** |  **Three**  
**Required** **Summer** **Internship** |  **No** |  Energy Science,   
Technology & Policy (EST&P) |  EST&P Advanced Study (EST&P-ADS)  
**Yes** |  EST&P   
Applied Study   
(EST&P-APS) |  EST&P Applied Advanced Study (EST&P-AAS)  
Degrees build from the top, left entry (the Foundational EST&P degree) to the right (Advanced Study Degree) and downward (Applied Study Degrees). The upper row lists the two Foundational Degrees; the Advanced Study Degree (second column) builds directly from the degree immediately to its left. The lower row lists the Applied Study Degrees, which are constructed directly from the Foundational Degrees immediately above them.
