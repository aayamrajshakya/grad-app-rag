I would describe myself as a historian focused on Contemporary Latin America from a social and cultural lens. This means applying a flexible conceptual and theoretical approach to my research, focusing on crucial factors such as class, solidarity and subalternity while not leaving behind the cultural practices, beliefs and values of everyday life. My goal is to understand how the people of different historical periods spent time together and created all kinds of interpersonal connections, while also studying their struggles against those groups who held power and domination over them. More specifically, I am using these conceptual and methodological tools to study the history of the Casa Grande hacienda during the years 1945-1968. A sugar-based property owned by the powerful Gildemeister family and located in the northern coast of Peru, Casa Grande used to be the biggest sugar complex in the world. This plantation has a long timeline of social conflict, which usually involved the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), one of the most powerful political movements in Peru's history. The APRA found in these sugar workers a powerful social base, which then became an important part of its electoral and syndicalist ambitions. 
Utilizing thousands of files and documents from the Peruvian Archivo Agrario, as well as a variety of regional newspapers, I seek to understand the social groups, class conflicts and cultural background of the hacienda during the 1945-1968 period.
