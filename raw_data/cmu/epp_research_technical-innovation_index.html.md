# Technology innovation policy
Technology innovation is fundamental to our global economic prosperity, social equity and inclusion, and well-being. Our work in this area is unique in that it addresses these problems from ‘inside the black box’ of technology.
We combine engineering with sociology, economics, and behavioral social science to seek technological, institutional, and policy solutions that are socially beneficial and problem-focused. In doing so, we use and develop new tools through a cutting-edge mix of quantitative and qualitative methods tailored to the technological problem of focus.
