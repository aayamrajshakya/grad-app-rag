# Breadth Courses
Ph.D. students must take one course from three out of four Breadth areas. The courses that satisfy each Breadth requirement are shown below.
Note
## Human Language and Communication
Courses in this category provide grounding in how humans communicate and interact with other humans. Students learn to investigate significant questions in linguistics, social sciences, and related fields. An essential component is study of how humans communicate and interact with other humans.
