#  Research 
My area of research is set theory, which is a branch of mathematical logic. Many of my results concern the hierarchy of large cardinal axioms, which are also called strong axioms of infinity. Large cardinals have been applied in many areas of mathematics, not just logic, to answer otherwise independent questions.
I am particularly interested in techniques for building inner models for large cardinals in ways that generalize Goedel’s Constructible Universe. I have also worked on connections between inner model theory and descriptive set theory, infinitary combinatorics, cardinal arithmetic and forcing.
