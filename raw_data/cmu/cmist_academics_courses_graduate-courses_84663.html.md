# Click. Hack. Rule: Understanding the Power & Peril of Cyber Conflict
## Course Number: 84-663 
This course explores the multifaceted landscape of cyber conflict across three distinct layers of the Internet: the cyber-physical layer, the software layer, and the application layer. The course will investigate the strategic use of these Internet layers by governments, both in times of peace and conflict. Topics will include the role of cyber capabilities in international warfare, espionage, coercion, and diplomacy, as well as their application to domestic objectives, such as surveillance and repression. Through a blend of theoretical discussions, case studies, and practical exercises, students will gain a comprehensive understanding of cybersecurity/s evolving landscape and its implications for national security and global geopolitics.
