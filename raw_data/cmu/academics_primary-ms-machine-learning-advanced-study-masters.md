# Finances
The Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study program does not provide any financial support and the student must pay tuition, student fees and living expenses on their own.
See the [financial information page](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/ms-finance) for costs.
# Apply
The Machine Learning Department uses the [School of Computer Science (SCS) Graduate Online Application](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr). You may apply for multiple programs at Carnegie Mellon and the Machine Learning Department's Master's Admissions Committee will consider your application independently.
Applications are accepted only once a year. All students begin the program in August, having applied the previous December.
For application information, including application deadlines, refer to the [SCS Master's Admissions](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions) page and [SCS Master's Admissions FAQ](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/faq).
# Frequently Asked Questions
### What are the prerequisites? Do I need an undergraduate degree in computer science? What test scores do I need?
We welcome applicants from a variety of backgrounds and an undergraduate degree in computer science is not required.
Incoming students must have a strong background in computer science, including a solid understanding of complexity theory and good programming skills, as well as a good background in mathematics. Specifically, the first-year courses assume at least one year of college-level probability and statistics, as well as matrix algebra and multivariate calculus.
For our introductory machine learning course, our [self-assessment test](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%7Ewcohen/10-601/self-assessment/Intro_ML_Self_Evaluation.pdf) will give you some idea of the background we expect students to have.
The average scores of accepted applicants for the MS in Machine Learning for fall 2025 were as follows:
  * Undergraduate Overall GPA: 3.9/4.0 or 9.5/10.0.
  * GRE Quantitative: 169 (88th percentile)
  * GRE Verbal: 160 (80th percentile)
  * GRE Analytical Writing: 4.1 (63rd percentile)
  * TOEFL: 111


Scores varied significantly and are only a small portion of applicants' qualifications. We do take people with a range of backgrounds for the master's program. For information about our selectivity rate and other statistics, refer to [the comparison table of all SCS master's programs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs-comparison).
### Are GRE scores required?
For applicants applying to the MS in Machine Learning - Advanced Study program in Fall 2025 for a start date of August 2026, GRE scores are optional  
We do not require or expect applicants to take a GRE Subject Test.
### Is it possible to complete the degree online?
No. At this time, we do not offer online or distance-learning classes. You must be physically present in Pittsburgh and able to attend classes on campus to complete the program.
### Is it possible to complete the degree part-time?
No, the Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study must be completed full-time.
Students interested in part-time study may wish to consider the research-optional version of the [Master's in Machine Learning](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/primary-ms-machine-learning-masters) program.
### Is it possible to apply or begin the program in spring?
No. Applications are accepted only in December and students must begin the program in August. We cannot make exceptions to this due to the timing of our Core courses.
### Can I switch between the Master's in Machine Learning and Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study?
No. Applicants must choose to apply to one program, the other program, or both. If an applicant is admitted to both programs, they must choose which program they're entering when they accept their offer of admission. It isn't possible to switch programs later.
### Can this program be completed as an integrated fifth-year program?
No, due to the intensive research requirement, the Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study cannot be completed as a fifth-year program.
CMU undergraduates may wish to read about our [fifth-year master's](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/5th-year-ms) pathway for the coursework-based Master's in Machine Learning.
### Can I transfer in from another university or from another program at CMU?
No, you may not simply transfer into our program. You must submit an application and be accepted into the program, following the same application procedure as other applicants. Furthermore, the machine learning program does not accept transfer credit from other universities, although in certain situations a specific course requirement may be waived and an additional elective may be taken in its place.
### I already have a master's degree. Can I still apply?
Yes, we welcome applicants from all backgrounds. As with all applicants, make sure that your statement of purpose makes it clear why you believe an additional master's will help you achieve your goals.
### How does this program compare with other programs at CMU?
The School of Computer Science has compiled a [comparison of its master's programs](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs), including a [table comparing program outcomes, average applicant scores and selectivity rates](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/masters/programs-comparison).
### Is this a STEM program?
Yes. As a program in Carnegie Mellon's School of Computer Science, the Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study is a STEM program.
### Where are your graduates working or studying?
The Career and Professional Development Center compiles [Post-Graduate Salaries and Destination Information](https://www.cmu.edu/career/outcomes/post-grad-dashboard.html) about all graduates.
Our first cohort of applications for the Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study are being submitted in Fall 2025. Our first cohort will matriculate in Fall 2026 to graduate in Spring 2028.
Since the coursework component is the same as the Master's in Machine Learning, we expect that graduates interested in working in industry will be strong candidates for the same jobs.
We expect that most students will be interested in entering Ph.D. programs after graduation. Students interested in beginning a Ph.D. immediately after earning the master's should apply for Ph.D. programs in the fall of their second year. The Master's in Machine Learning - Advanced Study program does not guarantee admission to the Ph.D. in Machine Learning program, but it is designed to provide strong preparation for students interested in a Ph.D.
### When should I apply? When will I hear back?
The application deadline can be found on the [SCS Master's Admissions](https://admissions.scs.cmu.edu/portal/apply_gr) page. It changes from year to year, but is generally in late November or early December. You should expect an email response sometime in February. If you apply to multiple programs, you should expect to receive separate responses from each program.
