# Plan of Study
The MSE Online is a part-time, 24-month-long program, consisting of six semesters, one of which is dedicated to writing the final term paper. The program typically begins in the Fall semester, and consists of synchronous meetings with program faculty, and asynchronous lectures and assignments.
Courses are typically divided into 7-week long "mini" courses that allow students to concurrently learn a wider range of topics, while scaffolding learning to more advanced topics later in the program. For example, the fall semester is broken into two mini semesters, mini-1 and mini-2. 
A dedicated student can anticipate completing the program in 6 semesters (2 years). The maximum amount of time allowed to complete the program is 7 years. Sample 2-year courses of study are below. Note that the course is different depending on whether you enter the program in the fall or spring semester, in a year ending in an even or odd number. 
In Spring 2025, we will be accepting applicants for Cohort D,
# How is online different from on-campus?
The MSE Online program offers the same curriculum focused on state-of-the art practices taught by the same faculty who teach our full-time campus students. Because MSE Online students are hand-selected to be actively working in software development, and to have an aptitude for reflective practice, we replaced the on-campus project with a [term paper](https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-as-online/term-paper.html) advised by our top faculty. 
If you’re looking for the on-campus experience, or want to apply what you learn to one of our industry-sponsored projects, check out our [on-campus program](https://mse.isri.cmu.edu/applicants/mse-as/studio.html).
