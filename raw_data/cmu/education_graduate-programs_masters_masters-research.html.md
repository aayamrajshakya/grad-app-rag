## Degree overview
In this degree you have the flexibility to tailor the proportion of research and coursework. You are required to dedicate ~half of your units to performing research. The remainder of your units are devoted to technical and professional development coursework. As part of your technical coursework, you will have the opportunity to expand on your mechanical engineering curriculum through courses offered by other departments in the College of Engineering, School of Computer Science, and Mellon College of Science. Detailed curriculum can be found in the most recent [handbook](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/handbooks.html).
## Research advisor selection process
A key part of this degree is performing research under the guidance of a faculty advisor. Advisors may be faculty members from any department within the College of Engineering, School of Computer Science, or Mellon College of Science. The department will facilitate the advisor search process after you have enrolled in the degree program.
## Research report and symposium
This degree culminates with a final research report and presentation to faculty and students at the Department of Mechanical Engineering's annual Masters Research Symposium each spring. Awards are given for the best posters as determined by a panel of judges consisting of faculty members and potentially industry professionals. Your external publication can be submitted to the department to fulfill the research report requirement.
