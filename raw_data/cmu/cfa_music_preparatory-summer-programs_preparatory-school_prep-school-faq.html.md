# Prep School FAQs
Below are answers to questions frequently asked by our students and their families. If you have any additional questions please contact us at 412-268-3667.

## Does the Prep School cancel for snow and other inclement weather?
An important note for the Spring semester: The Prep School rarely cancels classes due to snow. In general, we only cancel in cases of EXTREME winter storms. It is possible that your private teacher will cancel lessons even if the Prep School remains open. If that happens, they will contact you directly and will inform you of any make-up lessons. 
In the event of an extreme storm that warrants closing the Prep School, we will email all families of the closure as soon as we are able, will post the information on our home page: <https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/preparatory-summer-programs/preparatory-school/index.html> and will post on local news station WTAE (and their website).
For any questions regarding classes or lessons, feel free to contact the Prep School office at 412-268-3667.
