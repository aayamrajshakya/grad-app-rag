Our lab is interested in two central questions in developmental biology: how embryos use cell death to compensate for developmental errors and how cells change their shape during tissue morphogenesis. We have taken an interdisciplinary approach to addressing these questions, from genetics and molecular biology to high-end microscopy and computerized image analysis to the design and synthesis of new chemical reagents. We have have also developed new methods for comparative proteomics. Please select from the following links to learn more about our specific research interests:
