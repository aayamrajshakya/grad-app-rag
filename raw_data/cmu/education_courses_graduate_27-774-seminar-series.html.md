All full-time graduate students must enroll, attend, and actively participate in the graduate seminar course (27-774) each semester in which they are registered as full-time students. The goal of the seminar is to broaden each student's doctoral education through exposure to research performed by an international cadre of highly-respected external scientists.
Students are graded according to the following guidelines:
  1. The grade for the course is PASS or FAIL.
  2. To pass, the only requirement is attendance, with no more than two unexcused absences. Unexcused include doctor’s appointments, vacations, and any other absences that are not research related. Absences resulting from conference trips, visits to research sponsors, etc. are excused, but the seminar coordinator must be notified.
  3. Students with more than two unexcused absences are expected to make this up by attending seminars given in other departments or talks by external speakers at the University.
