## Program Overview
In a rapidly evolving world, the Pre-College Leadership Development Program at the Tepper School of Business empowers students to rise to the challenges of leading with clarity, empathy, and purpose. Guided by Carnegie Mellon faculty, students will explore the art and science of leadership through a diverse set of interactive experiences - blending reflection, collaboration, and real-world application.
The program introduces core social, emotional, and behavioral (SEB) skills - such as self-awareness, adaptability, communication, and ethical decision-making - through a matrix of learning experiences that fuel curiosity and confidence. Students will tackle complex leadership challenges, navigate team dynamics, and strengthen their public speaking abilities, all while building the habits that drive academic excellence and career readiness.
As artificial intelligence transforms the future of work, human-centered skills are more critical than ever. This program prepares students to lead with purpose and adaptability while laying a strong foundation for future academic and career success. By the end, students will leave with a clear leadership vision, practical tools for growth, and the confidence to make an impact in a rapidly changing world.
