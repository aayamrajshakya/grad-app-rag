William Davidson grew up in Rockford, Michigan where his earliest teachers were Jim Martin and Jed Scott. A winner of many awards, he was a semi-finalist prizewinner in the 2017 Waring International Piano Competition. He was also the recipient of the ASCAP Foundation Michael Masser award, Guy D. & Mary Edith Halladay award, and the Homer Wickline and Conrad Seamen career grant, as well as a prizewinner in the Pittsburgh Concert Society and Keynote of South Hills competitions. In 2019, he was selected to compete in the renowned Sendai International Music Competition in Sendai, Japan where he additionally performed in two community concerts sponsored by the competition.
A versatile collaborator, William has performed with many highly-esteemed musicians including Grammy-Award winning saxophonist Paquito D’Rivera and violinist Andres Cardenes. In the 2018-19 concert seasons, he joined his teacher Sergey Schepkin in piano duo and four-hand recitals celebrating the music of Bach and Beethoven as part of the Glissando concert series held in Boston.
William studied under Silvia Roederer at Western Michigan University and under Sergey Schepkin at Carnegie Mellon University where he completed his graduate studies. He has also performed in masterclasses with Byron Janis, Barry Douglas, and Nikolai Lugansky.
