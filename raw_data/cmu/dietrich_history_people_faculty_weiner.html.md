## Bio
Benno Weiner is a historian of Modern China, Tibet and Inner Asia. His work focuses on the ethnopolitics of twentieth-century state and nation building along China’s ethnocultural frontiers. It is driven by an otherwise unremarkable observation: that the prolonged, violent, and incomplete processes by which dominions of the Qing Empire were remade into integral parts of the consolidated Chinese state, and by which the disparate peoples who inhabit those areas were minoritized, marginalized, excluded, and even eliminated, are among the key underexplored and unresolved questions of modern Chinese history. Dr. Weiner is currently working on a book manuscript with the working title, “Imperial Borderland to Socialist State: Disintegration, Territorialization, and Minoritization on the Ethnic Margins of Modern China,” as well as a public-facing book presently titled, “Making Minorities in Modern China.”
[](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501749391/the-chinese-revolution-on-the-tibetan-frontier/)Dr. Weiner’s first book, [ _The Chinese Revolution on the Tibetan Frontier_](https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781501749391/the-chinese-revolution-on-the-tibetan-frontier/#bookTabs=1) (Cornell UP, 2020) is the first major study to employ significant county-level archival material to explore the Chinese Communist Party’s practices of state- and nation-building in an “ethnic minority region” during the first decade of the People’s Republic of China. Focusing on the Amdo region of the Tibetan Plateau, he argues that in the years immediately following the 1949 revolution, Party leaders implicitly understood both the administrative and epistemic obstacles to transforming what had been an expansive, variegated, and vertically organized imperial formation into an integrated, socialist, multinational-state. For much of the 1950s, the CCP therefore adapted imperial strategies of rule meant to “gradually,” “voluntarily,” and “organically” bridge the gap between empire and nation. This gradualist approach, however, ultimately lost out to both Han-centric impulses and revolutionary impatience that demanded more immediate paths to national integration and socialist transformation. This led in 1958 to a large-scale rebellion and its brutal pacification. Rather than an “organic transformation,” Weiner shows that the Amdo region was incorporated through the widespread and often indiscriminate deployment of state violence, and he details the long-term consequence both for Amdo Tibetans and for the state’s nation-building aspirations.
