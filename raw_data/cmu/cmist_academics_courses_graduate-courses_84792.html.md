# Policy Seminar II
## Course Number: 84-792 
In the Policy Seminar course, CMIST graduate students attend seminars across campus to learn how issues they cover in class are being tackled in the professional world. CMIST regularly brings diplomats, scholars, policymakers, journalists, and other thought leaders to the university to address major issues facing the United States and the world. CMIST graduate students will enroll in the three-unit Policy Seminar in their first two semesters and be expected to participate in and reflect on their interactions during the attended lectures and roundtable discussions.
