## Ph.D. in Human-Computer Interaction  

The HCII doctoral program offers an inspiring, collaborative and supportive atmosphere for graduate study. Our doctoral students engage in research from the moment they arrive, and take courses from across the computer sciences, behavioral sciences and the field of design. Ph.D. students with a range of backgrounds and interests are challenged with tracks allowing for specialization. HCII graduates have become the face of HCI across the world, pushing the boundaries of the kinds of problems that HCI addresses, and inventing the tools and methods used to solve those problems. Our graduates carry out this mission through faculty positions in top-ranked academic departments and positions in major industry research laboratories.
