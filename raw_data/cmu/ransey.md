# The Ransey Lab
The mission of the Ransey Lab is to advance our understanding of the diverse functions and regulation of gap junctions—essential intercellular channels that mediate direct cellular communication, metabolic exchange, and stress adaptation. By investigating the unique properties of connexin isoforms and their interactions, we aim to uncover how this dynamic network of channels influences tissue homeostasis and contributes to health and disease.
