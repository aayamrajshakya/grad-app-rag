## Graduate Student Handbook Suite
The Graduate Student Handbook Suite is a collection of the following documents that will inform and support your studies at Carnegie Mellon. You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with the entire Suite, as each component offers important information to guide your graduate experience and outlines critical processes and policies. Each handbook serves as a contract, of sorts, between you, the university, and your program and/or college.
