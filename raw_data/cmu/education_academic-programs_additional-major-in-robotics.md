# Additional Major in Robotics
Immerse yourself in the world of robotics through the Additional Major, a dynamic fusion of multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary exploration. Open to students across all majors and colleges at Carnegie Mellon University, this program provides a gateway to mastering the essence of robotics.
Begin your journey with a comprehensive introductory robotics overview, laying the groundwork for your exploration. The cornerstone of this major is motion and control, serving as the bedrock upon which the layers of sensing, cognition, and action are artfully assembled.
Guided by the principle that robotics involves crafting tangible embodiments of these core principles, a ‘hands-on’ course requirement enhances your understanding. These focal points converge under the distinct systems perspective that defines robotics, adding an exceptional dimension to your education.

## Admission to the Additional Major Program
The Additional Major in robotics is designed for students who want to explore the field more than is possible through the Minor in Robotics.
Although students can come from any department on campus, the nature of the courses required for the Additional Major makes it ideal for students already pursuing an undergraduate degree in computer science through the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.cmu.edu), or in engineering through [the College of Engineering](http://www.cit.cmu.edu).
## How to Apply
The application period is January 7 – February 3. 
Required application materials include:
  * Full name, email address and Andrew ID
  * Home college, GPA (3.0 or higher), year you intend to graduate, and list of all declared Majors and Minors 
    * 1st year students please put the major you plan on declaring.
  * Proposed schedule of required courses (This is just the list the courses you intend to take to fulfill the Additional Major requirements which is a part of the application itself)
  * Statement of purpose (1-2 page, single spaced, to articulate why the student wants to pursue the robotics major)


PLEASE NOTE: You must be a current CMU undergraduate student and possess a valid CMU email address to complete the application.
