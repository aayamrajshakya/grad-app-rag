# M.M. in Collaborative PIano and AMS in Collaborative Piano
If you are looking to expand your career opportunities and open many professional paths, you may want to consider applying for a Master of Music or AMS in Collaborative Piano. Studying collaborative piano offers pianists a vibrant and interactive musical life that extends well beyond solo performance. Collaborative piano is a rich, expressive art form that places pianists at the heart of musical collaboration and community.  
  
In addition to your audition pre-screening requirements, an additional video under 10 minutes of any form of collaboration with any other instrument or vocalist would be necessary. If you are selected to advance to the live audition, you will be asked for an online or in-person interview with the Collaborative Piano faculty.  
  
*Note, this is only for applicants applying to a M.M or AMS program in Piano who would also like to be considered for Collaborative Piano. Applicants interested in applying only for Collaborative Piano should follow the audition requirements [here](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/apply/audition-portfolio-review/requirements-by-area/collaborative-piano-audition-requirements.html).
