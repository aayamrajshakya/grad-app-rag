## Health Insurance
Health insurance fees vary. Full-time students will be assessed an annual fee to cover the cost of the basic health insurance plan offered by the university. The fee will be waived for students who provide the university with verification of health care coverage from another source. Students will also be given the opportunity to increase coverage and will receive information concerning plan options and prices from the university prior to enrollment. All questions about student health insurance should be directed to [University Health Services](http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/).
