# Research at Mellon College of Science
The future of science is audacious and creative — where bold ideas meet real-world impact. By bringing together Carnegie Mellon University’s expertise in foundational science, artificial intelligence, engineering and data analytics, Mellon College of Science (MCS) researchers are asking and answering critical questions for the next generation of discovery.
## How We Drive Progress
Science is in the midst of a rapid transformation — one that MCS and CMU are uniquely positioned to lead with our commitment to limitless collaboration and complementary strengths. That energy is being used to codebreak cancer, develop new defenses against climate change and delve into the mysteries of the universe.

## How One Mind Can Shape Research
In her first semester as a doctoral student, Nicole Auvil was challenged by Chemistry Research Professor and Director for the [Center for Molecular Analysis](https://www.cmu.edu/chemistry/facilities/cma/index.html) Mark Bier to create ultrasharp tungsten needles for use in mass spectrometry. Despite the uncertainty of success, she adapted electrochemical etching methods to produce needles as small as 8 nm — over a thousand times sharper than commercial ones — by her second semester.
Auvil emphasized the broad impact of mass spectrometry, noting its role in testing everyday products.
"People don't realize that so many items they use on a daily basis — medications, personal care products, food and beverages, even the air we breathe — have been tested by a mass spectrometer at some point or another," Auvil said. "Bier encourages our lab to innovate and think outside of the box. Once you hit a certain technical understanding, research is just as much art and creativity as it is science."
