#  Keith Allen, Ph.D., 1997 
March 29, 2017
I’ve spent most of the past two decades employed as an applied historian. Since completing my Ph.D. I’ve served on an international scholarly commission in Bern investigating Switzerland's wartime ties to Nazi Germany, directed web content development at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, and curated the first pan-European exhibition on the legacies of World War II in Brussels. While I’ve mainly completed projects on behalf of clients, I’ve also been able to pursue my own research. In 2014, I obtained funding from the German Research Foundation (DFG) to complete the first study of migrant security vetting in Germany after 1945. Entitled Interrogation Nation: Refugees and Spies in Cold War Germany
I live in Berlin, where I recently accepted a position as a Research Scholar at the Institute for Contemporary History (Institut für Zeitgeschichte – Munich and Berlin
