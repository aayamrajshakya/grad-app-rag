## What Will You Gain?
Through this certificate, you’ll build your understanding of the abilities and the limitations of technologies, materials and systems. You’ll also gain teamwork and communications experience through collaborative projects with other student professionals.
#### You'll gain:
  * The ability to make thoughtful decisions regarding “X” design
  * Understanding of capabilities and uses of technologies, materials and systems in a product innovation context
  * The necessary skills to engineer a stack of considerations including materials, mechanisms and processes


## Curriculum Details
The first course emphasizes product engineering design — everything from stress analysis to heat transfer, kinematics, and mechanisms. Students will learn the concepts of design for “X” and the impact that design decisions have on product development. In the second course, students will study the potential and current limitations of critical technologies in use today, such as artificial intelligence, data science, and interactive connected products.  
  
**Note:**  
49-603 Cyber-Physical Product Design49-602 Designing for Production & Sustainability
## Course 1: 49-602, Designing for Production and Sustainability
#### COURSE HIGHLIGHTS
  * Learn principles and philosophies of engineering design
  * Understand the impact and implications of design decisions on later stage product development steps
  * Incorporate the distribution and life cycle of a product into early product design
  * Study the fundamental concepts of sustainable design and the impacts it has on product development and design decisions


#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course will teach the basic principles and philosophies of engineering design, with emphasis on mechanical engineering, due to the broad scope of applications of mechanical engineering which include but are not limited to stress analysis and fracture, heat transfer, kinematics and systems packaging. Recognizing that design is a first step in a sequence of later decisions and steps (development, manufacture, distribution and life cycle of a product), this course will look at the influence of materials, manufacturing and other downstream decisions/actions on the overall design of a product.
However, what we design and how we develop it also impacts our environment for years to come, so importantly this course will also cover various aspects of sustainable design from a product life cycle perspective.
## Course 2: 49-603, Cyber-Physical Product Design
Pre/Co-requisite: 49-602 - Designing for Production & Sustainability
#### COURSE HIGHLIGHTS
  * Learn the capabilities and limitations of current technologies such as AI, data science and interactive connected products
  * Learn to frame a problem, choose data sources and needed sensors and perform exploratory data analysis
  * Practice basic modeling and prototyping, then communicate the results
  * Complete a final project incorporating elements of connected products and smart systems


#### COURSE DESCRIPTION
Driven by the combination of increased access to data, local data storage, computational power, interconnectivity and improved algorithms, mainstream technologies increasingly incorporate sensing (IoT) and data science (AI) "smarts."
After an introduction of some basic concepts and techniques in AI, data science and interactive connected products, the course illustrates both the potential and current limitations of these techniques with examples from a variety of applications.
Students will be introduced to technologies and AI algorithms through a series of hands-on exercises, collaborative projects, in-depth discussions and instructor-led tutorials. Exercises will include close examination of the inputs and outputs of various technologies as well as with analysis of the gathered information, with the goal of learning to select appropriate technologies and analyses for a given problem and anticipated design implications. Students will also complete a final project that takes a project from start to finish that incorporates elements of connected products and smart systems (framing the problem, choosing data sources and needed sensors, exploratory data analysis, basic modeling, basic prototyping, communicating results).The course is designed such that students can complete this course with only a basic familiarity with statistics, without any knowledge of programming, electronics or systems.
"Each certificate opened new doors. Each certificate opened up connections to new thinking and how it would apply to me."_
