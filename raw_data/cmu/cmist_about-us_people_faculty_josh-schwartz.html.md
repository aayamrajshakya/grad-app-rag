## Bio
Joshua A. Schwartz is an Assistant Professor in the Carnegie Mellon Institute for Strategy & Technology (CMIST). His research focuses on questions related to the effectiveness of military force and technology, public and policymaker support for the use of force and technology, and the spread of military technology around the world. Dr. Schwartz has written widely on topics such as the global proliferation of armed drones and their counter-terrorism effectiveness, public and policymaker support for the use of weapons of mass destruction, the role of gender stereotypes in international politics, whether countries should go to war to bolster their reputations for resolve, the nexus between domestic political polarization and foreign policy, and even the lessons that can be learned from dragon power in [Game of Thrones](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/04/29/dragon-power-is-awesome-it-cant-tell-you-how-rule/) and [House of the Dragon](https://doi.org/10.1080/15512169.2024.2428265). His academic work has been published in top peer-reviewed journals like [International Organization](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0020818320000223) and [International Security](https://doi.org/10.1162/isec_a_00483), as well as in prominent policy outlets like  _[Foreign Affairs](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/what-drones-can-and-cannot-do-battlefield),_[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/08/18/drone-alqaeda-terrorist-attack/), [Lawfare](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/why-more-female-leaders-won-t-lead-to-more-peace), and [War on the Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2024/12/stealth-and-scale-quality-quantity-and-modern-military-power/).
