# Graduate training program
The CNBC training program brings together several of the strongest programs of each of the two universities to train interdisciplinary scientists interested in understanding how cognitive processes arise from neural mechanisms in the brain. Students combine intensive training in their chosen specialty with broad exposure to other disciplines that touch on neural computation and problems of higher brain function. Members of the CNBC community have access to a wide range of resources,including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanners for functional brain imaging, neurophysiology laboratories for recording from awake, behaving animals, electron and confocal microscopes for structural imaging, high performance computing facilities including an in-house supercomputer for neural simulation and image analysis, and patient populations for neuropsychological studies.
The CNBC training program is a research-oriented training program aimed at helping students develop their ability to become outstanding interdisciplinary scientists. Because of the discipline and focus required to carry out publishable scientific research,as well as the fact that publication plays a strong role in future career opportunities,students are encouraged from the earliest stages of their training to orient their research activities around projects intended to result in refereed publications. 
This certificate program is open to students currently pursuing Ph.D.s in either Carnegie Mellon University or the University of Pittsburgh, subject to approval from the student’s home program. Students may [apply](https://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/cnbcv2/sample-page/) for membership upon admission to a CNBC-affiliated doctoral program or at any time after arrival in Pittsburgh.  
  
The following is a brief description of the CNBC training program. 
## Certificate requirements
The CNBC Graduate Training Program consists of 3 required areas: Core Courses, Brain Bags, and Ethics Education.
In a Nutshell
  * Get a B or higher in four core courses (the flagship Foundations of the Neural Basis of Cognition + one course in each other course area)
  * Attend 11 additional research-focused Brain Bags, in person 
  * Present your research in a Brain Bag presentation
  * Attend 3 CNBC Ethics Roundtables or
  * Attend at least one CNBC retreat


  

Core Courses
Students are required to complete core courses in Cognitive Neuroscience, Neurophysiology, Systems Neuroscience, and Computational Neuroscience. The minimum passing grade for a core course is “B”. Students are expected to complete all of the core courses by the end of their third year. Students are encouraged to take advantage of elective courses when they are offered.
For an overview of the courses that satisfy these requirements, visit the [**CNBC Core Courses list**](https://thecnbc.notion.site/9a9cae8c81bb4300a20a425028e3fc35?v=371f4ab5a8464e0b9529a8157fb4c512). 
Brain Bags
Students are required to give a Brain Bag presentation at some point during their time at the CNBC. Ideally this presentation is given during the 2nd or 3rd year. In order to remain in good standing with the CNBC and be eligible for funding students must plan to present their research by the end of their PhD and also attend 11 Brain Bags over their studies.
Ethics Education
Ethics education has become an essential component of scientific training programs. Many of our students are involved in experimental work with animals or human subjects, and need to learn about the regulations governing these activities and the moral obligations of scientists toward their subjects. In addition, all scientists must deal with professional issues such as authorship disputes, questions of scientific integrity, and ownership of intellectual property.
Students are expected to meet their ethics training obligation early in their graduate career, normally in the first or second year. Although there is no formal obligation for recurrent training, the CNBC encourages both students and faculty to continue to participate in Ethics Roundtable activities in order to hear new perspectives and keep abreast of recent developments.
