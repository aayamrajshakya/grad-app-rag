# Software Engineering Matters
Software engineering is the branch of computer science that creates practical, cost-effective solutions to computing and information processing problems, preferentially by applying scientific knowledge, developing software systems in the service of mankind.

## Mission
The mission of the SE Ph.D. program at Carnegie Mellon is to educate the next generation of high-impact software engineering leaders -- research leaders who will discover fundamentally more effective ways to engineer practical software, educational leaders who will make the next generation of software engineers more professional than today’s, and industry leaders who will solve challenging software development problems of the future, transforming our digital society in service of humanity.
## History of Software Engineering at CMU
CMU is one of the institutions that pioneered the study of software engineering. Ideas such as information hiding, abstract data types, and [software architecture](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/research/index.html#orgprop) were first developed here. More recently, CMU faculty have led the field in areas such as the empirical study of [software development organizations](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/research/index.html#orgs), [automated program repair](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/research/index.html#notestools), and many others. We encourage you to read about the [research](https://se-phd.isri.cmu.edu/research/index.html) going on today!
# dive deeper
The unique history and nature of software engineering at Carnegie Mellon can hardly be summed up here. However, if you want to know more about the significant and lasting contributions CMU has made to software engineering, we encourage you to consider "[Software Engineering for the 21st Century: A basis for rethinking the curriculum](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~Compose/SEprinciples-pub-rev2.pdf)" by Dr. Mary Shaw.
Additionally, the Fall 2018 edition of IEEE Software featured a piece, [Half a Century of Software Engineering Education: The CMU Exemplar](https://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2018/05/mso2018050025.pdf), by Software Engineering faculty on the history of software engineering education at Carnegie Mellon. This piece does a tremendous job of summarizing the groundbreaking approach to software engineering pioneered here.
