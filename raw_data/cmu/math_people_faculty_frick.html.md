#  Research 
My research "geometrizes" problems that benefit from understanding global information. Topology and geometry are suitable tools to organize non-local phenomena and detect global obstructions. Sometimes these problems are of geometric nature themselves, such as understanding the intersection combinatorics of convex hulls in Euclidean space, inscribing geometric shapes into curves, partitioning a point set by hyperplanes, or reconstructing the shape that a data set was sampled from. I also apply geometric-topological methods further afield. Examples include chromatic numbers of hypergraphs and extremal combinatorics, fair division problems in game theory, and packing and covering inequalities in combinatorial settings.
