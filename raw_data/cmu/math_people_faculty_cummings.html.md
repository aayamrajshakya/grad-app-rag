#  Research 
I work mostly in the area of combinatorial set theory, which is the study of combinatorial objects (e.g. graphs, posets, colourings) in a setting where the underlying set is infinite. I am particularly interested in "Singular cardinal combinatorics". My work has touched on a number of areas in set theory including forcing, large cardinals, Ramsey theory and PCF theory. Recent research topics have included the structure theory of linear orderings and posets, rainbow Ramsey theory, strong forcing axioms, and new forcing techniques for obtaining consistency results in singular cardinal combinatorics. I have also done some work in finite combinatorics, using tools including algebraic constructions and the flag algebra method to prove asymptotic extremal results about colourings of finite complete graphs.
