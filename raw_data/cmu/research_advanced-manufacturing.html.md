# Advanced manufacturing
We are defining the future of advanced manufacturing research by fabricating technologies for implantable medical devices, automotive racing applications using metal additive manufacturing, and lithographic processes for M/NEMS sensors.
## Advanced manufacturing
* ### Additive manufacturing
Our leadership in additive manufacturing (AM) research includes analysis, modeling, experimentation, qualification, and device development and characterization.
Expertise extends to process mapping, geometric and mechanical characterization, optimized assembly, control systems, role of powder properties in metal AM, and finishing processes and systems for AM fabricated parts.
Researchers are using new techniques to 3D print ceramics, biodegradable actuators, lithium-ion battery electrodes, and devices for aerospace and biomedical industries.

* ### Micro/nano-manufacturing
Researchers investigate a diverse range of advanced manufacturing processes and associated equipment to create micro- and nano-scale components and devices.
Expertise includes micromachining and micromilling, nano-molding of polymers, soft-lithography, semiconductor and data storage manufacturing, and micro-scale finishing processes.
Exciting new approaches include DNA origami (bottom up manufacturing) to enable nanomanufacturing and nanomechanics of multiprotein systems as well as exploring microstructures for biomimetic sensors and actuators (top down manufacturing).
Developing new materials for thermal management—like polymer nanofibers and supersolder—will transform thermal management in electronic devices.
