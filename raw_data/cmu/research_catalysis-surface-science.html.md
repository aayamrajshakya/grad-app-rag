# Catalysis and surface science 
We integrate experimental surface science and automated, data-rich experiments with data science, machine learning, and molecular simulation to uncover how the catalyst's properties are determined by its structure, composition, and reaction conditions. Our goals are to:
  * discover new catalyst materials
  * develop new concepts in reactivity and catalyst design


Current focus areas include:
  * hydrocarbon conversion
  * fuel cells
  * batteries
  * enantioselectivity of chiral fine chemicals


## Sample research projects
* ### Kareem Abdelmaqsoud
My research focuses on integrating machine learning with atomistic simulations to accelerate the discovery of novel catalysts and materials for energy and industrial applications. I work closely with experimental researchers in both the chemical engineering and materials science and engineering departments to bridge the gap between simulations and experiments. An application of this work is designing chiral catalyst surfaces for the purification of chiral pharmaceuticals.

* ### Carolina Colombo Tedesco
I am developing computational frameworks to investigate a promising technique called Dynamic or Programmable Catalysis. I am exploring methods to simulate these systems and identify the ideal oscillation conditions that make the technique most effective. The research aims to guide experimentalists in designing devices and systems to take full advantage of this approach.

* ### Ian Martin
Some molecules exhibit chirality, meaning they are structural mirror images of one another but chemically identical. Many bioprocesses involve chiral compounds as they are ubiquitous in the human body, making them highly relevant in fields such as pharmaceutical science. My research investigates the impact of metal catalyst surface structure on reaction kinetics of chiral compounds.

* ### Janghoon Ock
I envision AI as a transformative tool in catalyst design, not only reducing computational costs but also simplifying complexity and improving accessibility. My research integrates language models, multimodal learning, and autonomous AI agents to lower both computational and conceptual barriers. By developing a predictive language model, a multimodal learning framework, and an AI agent for adsorption analysis, this approach makes catalyst discovery more efficient, adaptable, and accessible to a broader scientific community.
