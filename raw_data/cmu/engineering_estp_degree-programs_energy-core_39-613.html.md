Overview  
The logistics and cost of moving and storing energy vary greatly by energy form and geographic region. This mini begins with a global look at resources and the sources, movements, processing and storage of fossil and nuclear fuels. Once fuels have been delivered and converted to heat or electricity, the issues of moving and storage re-emerge. Efficient use of renewable electric power resources is considered, with emphasis on distributed resources and managing variability and intermittency. The technical and economic aspects of electric power transmission, distribution and storage are also evaluated. Management, regulation and operation of the grid are evaluated, including various SmartGrid and MicroGrid initiatives and technologies in the US and worldwide.  
  
Students will work in project teams to research and evaluate regional energy transport & storage infrastructure & status for an assigned region. Student will make projections of future regional T&S needs, challenges and shortfalls (~25 years). Finally, students will evaluate options (qualitatively and quantitatively) and recommend optimal new and modified energy transport & storage infrastructure and practices needed for the assigned region.
