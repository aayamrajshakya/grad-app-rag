## Bio
"How do you uncover alpha in a sea of noise?" I ask myself this every day as I dive into markets and models. I'm passionate about quantitative trading and driven by curiosity. I enjoy solving puzzles, decoding patterns, and finding what others miss.  
  
I seek to join a fast-paced trading firm where I can sharpen my skills, build smart strategies, and grow with a team that values creativity and rigor. I bring hands-on experience in factor research, from signal generation to backtesting. I don't stop at one method - I explore, iterate, and embrace the trial-and-error process that turns ideas into results.  
  
My academic training in financial engineering and my strong grasp of statistics, programming, and data help me connect theory to real-world performance. I think fast, act thoughtfully, and work well under pressure.  
  
If you're looking for someone who will question assumptions, test limits, and bring fresh insights to your team-I'm ready. I would welcome the chance to speak with you on Zoom or in person to show how I can create value for your firm.
