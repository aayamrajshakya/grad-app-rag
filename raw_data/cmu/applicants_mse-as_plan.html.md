# Plan of Study
The MSE is a 16-month long program consisting of three traditional semesters and one intensive summer session. The program begins in the fall and concludes the following year in December. Project work begins in the spring, with the summer session devoted primarily to the Studio Project.
Courses in the first year are divided into 7-week mini-semesters to allow students to concurrently learn a wider range of topics, while scaffolding learning to more advanced topics later in the program. For example, Semester 1-2 is the second half of the first program semester, normally in the Fall.
