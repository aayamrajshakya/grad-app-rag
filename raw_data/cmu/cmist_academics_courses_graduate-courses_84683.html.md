# National Cyber Policy & Strategy
## Course Number: 84-683 
The decisions nations make in cyberspace have profound implications for both prosperity and sovereignty. The internet is a digital thread tying together peoples. The nature of our participation in this ecosystem is determined by policy makers. Cyber policy mirrors the political ethos of governments. Some nations choose to use cyber as a tool of control and repression, others construct cyber policies as key enablers of innovation and the free exchange of ideas. The translation of traditional policy objectives into a direction for cyber is often problematic. The perpetually liminal state of conflict in cyberspace adds another set of challenges for policy makers.
In this course we will explore national cyber policies. We will compare approaches and explore the role of culture. In our analysis we will enumerate the attributes of effective national cyber policy and conduct postmortems on failed policies. We will examine the ethical questions faced by cyber policy makers. Every citizen has a role in cyber policy. This course is intended to prepare future policy makers and create informed citizens.
