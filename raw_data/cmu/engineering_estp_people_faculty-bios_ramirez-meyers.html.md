# Katrina Ramirez-Meyers
Katrina Ramirez-Meyers is a materials scientist and energy systems analyst working on developing low-cost materials and processing strategies for stationary batteries and electric-vehicle battery recycling. She combines materials science experimentation with techno-economic and policy analyses to address battery supply chain challenges, aiming to meet the energy needs of underserved communities worldwide and facilitate the global clean energy transition.Katrina earned a BA in Mathematics and Spanish from Goucher College in 2011, an MS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Texas at Austin in 2019, and a joint Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering and Engineering & Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University in 2023.Her research included S/TEM and EELS analyses of LiFePO4 cathode degradation; statistical analyses of battery state-of-health after hybrid-vehicle usage; modeling the techno-economics of second-life battery packs; experimental and economic investigations of direct-recycling LiFePO4 cathode materials; and exploring MnO 2 cathode performance in alkaline electrolytes.In her free time, Katrina enjoys watching comedies and sci-fi with her husband and two cats, playing soccer and ping pong, and spending time with family and friends.
