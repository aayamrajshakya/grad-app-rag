# Required Training
All personnel involved in Human Subjects Research that is under the purview of the CMU IRB must demonstrate completion of an education program on the use of human participants in research. As of July 27, 2015 all individuals involved in Human Subjects Research (HSR) must complete training every three years. IRB applications will not be approved until training is complete. 
Training is done via an online program through the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI). First time IRB users should complete a Basic course. Thereafter a Refresher course can be taken
To Access CITI
Follow [CITI login instructions](https://www.cmu.edu/research-compliance/clinical-trials/forms/2017%20Dec%20CITI%20Instructions.pdf) [PDF] to log in to CITI.
All CMU employees and students have a CMU issued Andrew ID and should use Single Sign-On (SSO) to ensure that the course record is linked to your CMU activity. If you've used CITI prior to CMU having SSO, please check your CITI account and confirm that your CMU email address (XXX@andrew.cmu.edu) and your first and last name (per your official CMU record) are part of your CITI profile. This allows your previous CITI records to be matched with your current CITI and CMU activity. 
If you are not a CMU employee or student but are collaborating on HSR, you can create a CITI account and affiliate with CMU. 
If you have trouble logging into CITI contact the CITI helpdesk. 
When you have logged in you will be directed to a page titled "Select Curriculum" which displays a list of courses on Human Subjects Research: Biomedical Research Investigators or Social & Behavioral Investigators. Choose the human subject research module most appropriate to the type of research you conduct. 
If you have completed CITI training for another organization, add CMU to your profile. You will be given credit for your previous courses to the extent they overlap with CMU's requirements, however, additional modules may need to be completed.
