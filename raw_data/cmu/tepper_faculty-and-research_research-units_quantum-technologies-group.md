# Quantum Technologies Group
Motivated by supply chain, finance, technology, and health care applications, the Quantum Technologies Group at the Tepper School aims to turn quantum computing as a service into industrial reality, help design practical quantum communication networks, and develop quantum-inspired hardware.

Quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms offer dramatically new possibilities to tackle practical problems previously considered intractable. Right now.

## Quantum Areas of Research
  
The research of the Quantum Technologies Group (QTG) at the Tepper School focuses on the creation of radically different types of algorithms to optimize complex large-scale industrial problems startlingly faster, with the ultimate desired outcome of commercialized algorithms that are easily accessible for practical application.
We are also exploring unconventional hardware, studying practical issues in quantum communications, and analyzing other quantum technologies (such as sensing) by framing fundamental problems in quantum information science as semidefinite programs.
QTG research takes place in five parallel areas:
  1. Solving practical problems using novel quantum and quantum-inspired algorithms.  

  2. Developing robust and efficient processes of translating a mathematical algorithm into physical instructions executed by the hardware — known as compilers — for quantum computers.  

  3. Understanding and enhancing quantum speedup: How and why speed is increased, and by how much.  

  4. Quantum Communication: (a) How much classical information can be securely and reliably sent over a quantum channel in presence of inevitable buffering? (b) How to design high throughput quantum switches with high fidelity entanglement?  

  5. Hardware: How well can Photonic Ising Machines (PIM) solve benchmark combinatorial problems such as Max-Cut and Number Partitioning Problem?

By creatively advancing methods from geometry of numbers, computational integer programming, and algebraic geometry, QTG research has:
  * Solved instances of real-world finance problems in seconds  

    * Research: [Graver Bases Via Quantum Annealing With Application to Non-Linear Integer Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.04215)  

  * Developed the Graver-Augmented Multi-Seed algorithm (GAMA), a Quantum-inspired classical algorithm that is two (and three) orders of magnitude faster than commercial best-in-class solvers. GAMA has been applied to solve problems in supply chain management involving integrated production, inventory, and logistics. These work on standard computer hardware and do not require access to digital annealers or quantum hardware.

### Quantum-inspired Bi-level algorithm for Disaster Preparation
In the aftermath of a sudden catastrophe, First Responders (FRs) strive to reach and rescue immobile victims. Simultaneously, civilians use the same roads to evacuate, access medical facilities and shelters, or reunite with their relatives, via private vehicles. The goal is to reserve lanes that simultaneously allow access by FR to help needy victims while allowing those that can self-evacuate to do so efficiently without using these reserved lanes. Our quantum-inspired algorithm outperforms classical state of the art methods (such as Branch & Bound) on real-world instances.

### Quantum Machine Learning for Image Classification
Early diagnosis of pneumonia is crucial to increase the chances of survival and reduce the recovery time of the patient. Chest X-ray images, the most widely used method in practice, are challenging to classify. Our aim is to develop a quantum machine learning tool that can accurately classify images as belonging to normal or infected individuals.

## Compiling on Quantum Computers
To solve practical problems on a real quantum computer, we must translate the real-world problem into something that can be understood by the physical hardware
There are two dominant computational models for quantum computing:
  * Circuit (Gate) models, with hardware from Google, IBM, and Rigetti.  

  * Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) with hardware from D-Wave.


QTG has developed two novel algorithms for compiling quantum circuits
  * Research: [Knuth-Bendix Completion Algorithm and Shuffle Algebras for Compiling NISQ Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00129)


QTG has also developed a systematic computational approach to prepare a polynomial optimization problem for AQC.
  * Research: [A Novel Algebraic Geometry Compiling Framework for Adiabatic Quantum Computations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01440)


Current QTG research on compiling enhances methods for Gate/circuit chips to account directly for the noise, incorporating models into our algorithms directly and adapts computational methods from Mixed-Integer Linear Programming to create open-source compilers for AQC.

## Understanding Quantum Speedup
Where does quantum speedup really come from? How can we enhance the speedup

## Quantum Communication
Quantum queue-channels arise naturally in the context of buffering in quantum networks. We study the important practical case of symmetric Generalized Amplitude Damping, and extend our results to Unital qubit queue-channels: We show that the maximum classical capacity can be achieved without entanglement (in encoding and decoding)! We also study how to improve quantum switches using entanglement distillation optimally.

## Hardware
Photonic Ising Machines (PIMs) offer alternatives to quantum annealing and simulated annealing. An NP-hard problem is cast as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) where the final spin configuration in the Ising model is adiabatically arrived at as a solution to a Hamiltonian, given a known set of interactions between spins.
The temporal multiplexed Ising machine uses the bistable response of an electro-optic modulator to mimic the spin up and down states and solves the Max-Cut problem on par with Gurobi for up to 1000 spins.
The spatial photonic Ising machine easily partitions an array of 2^14 integers, vastly outperforming both Gurobi and the state-of-the-art D-Wave annealer.

Results for a problem instance of size 16384 spins. The periodic sudden dips in the cost function are a signature of the adiabatic tuning of the coupling constants. As shown in the plot on the bottom right of the figure, the fidelity escapes a local minima fairly easily, allowing us to sample a large energy landscape. Further, we can see that the number of accepted flips is lower than the number of rejected flips. Insets on the colourmaps shown in the left show an expanded view of a section of 10 × 10 spins.

### What is Quantum Computing?
Today's computers work by manipulating bits that exist as a 0 or a 1, whereas quantum computers encode information as quantum bits, or qubits, with the potential to be millions of times more powerful than today's most powerful supercomputers.
