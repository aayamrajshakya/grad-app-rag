# Autonomous and data-driven sciences
At the intersection of machine learning and the physical world, we are leveraging automation to accelerate the development of new therapies, materials, and processes. A human working with autonomous or semi-autonomous systems can design and run experiments much more quickly, accurately, and efficiently than a human alone.
Students in our experimental and computational research groups are:
  * combining laboratory automation techniques with powerful large language models (LLMs)
  * doing high-throughput imaging of bacterial interaction and community dynamics
  * developing semi-autonomous workflows to validate closed-loop self-sustaining materials discovery pipelines
  * building on foundational work from our process systems engineering group
  * coupling machine learning with state-of-the-art optimization tools for automated construction of surrogate models
  * investigating machine learning approaches for optimal operation of large complex systems


Work in autonomous sciences is not only increasing throughput but also empowering engineers and scientists to think in new ways to solve intractable problems. Our faculty are thought leaders on the ethical and responsible use of these powerful tools.
## Sample research projects
* ### Kareem Abdelmaqsoud
My research focuses on integrating machine learning with atomistic simulations to accelerate the discovery of novel catalysts and materials for energy and industrial applications. I work closely with experimental researchers in both the chemical engineering and materials science and engineering departments to bridge the gap between simulations and experiments. An application of this work is designing chiral catalyst surfaces for the purification of chiral pharmaceuticals.

* ### Cheick Dosso
I develop computational fluid dynamics models and math programming frameworks to optimize carbon capture processes using membranes. Ultimately, this research aims to make carbon capture more efficient and affordable, supporting cleaner energy production.

* ### Yu-Shan Chang
My research focuses on the rational co-design of chemical processes and microporous materials that are employed in these processes as adsorbents, filters, or catalysts, among other functions. While materials and processes are often developed separately, doing so simultaneously can expose synergies that could not otherwise be reached via the traditional design paradigm. In my research, I integrate numerical optimization, machine learning, and molecular simulation, among other computational approaches, to identify novel material-process pairs among the astronomical potential combinations that can be envisioned.

* ### Robert MacKnight
My research focuses on developing AI agents that combine large language models with chemistry tools to help bridge the gap between computational and experimental approaches. While we've made progress in creating systems that can assist with tasks like reaction optimization and molecular design, there's still significant work ahead to fully democratize these specialized tools. The ultimate goal is to reduce technical barriers so scientists can focus more on creative problem-solving and less on mastering multiple technical specialties.

* ### Nicholas Hattrup
Computational simulations, like molecular dynamics, help us understand and discover new materials and molecules. My research focuses on improving these simulation methods so we can estimate material properties more efficiently and with fewer resources. The ultimate goal is to create a tool that can be routinely used in large-scale material screening efforts, which are becoming more and more common.

* ### Janghoon Ock
I envision AI as a transformative tool in catalyst design, not only reducing computational costs but also simplifying complexity and improving accessibility. My research integrates language models, multimodal learning, and autonomous AI agents to lower both computational and conceptual barriers. By developing a predictive language model, a multimodal learning framework, and an AI agent for adsorption analysis, this approach makes catalyst discovery more efficient, adaptable, and accessible to a broader scientific community.

* ### Victor Alejandro Sanchez
I conduct uncertainty quantification to constrain parametric uncertainties in climate model projections of the radiative impacts of biomass burning aerosols released in Southern Africa. My approach combines machine learning to efficiently explore high-dimensional parameter spaces with frequentist statistical techniques to reduce model parametric uncertainties. Moving forward, my research will focus on quantifying model uncertainties in simulations of Southern Ocean cyclones.
