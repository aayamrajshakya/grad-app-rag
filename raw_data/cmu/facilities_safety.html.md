Every student and staff member in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University has the right to perform their work in a safe environment. Likewise, each person working in an MSE laboratory has the obligation to know and exercise safe laboratory practices. Good safety practice includes a sense of awareness of potential hazards and being prepared. Remember that safe laboratory practice is to our own benefit, as well as to our colleagues working in the labs with us.
