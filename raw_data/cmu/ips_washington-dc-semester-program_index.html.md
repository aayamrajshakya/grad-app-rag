## In DC, decisions are made by those who show up. This is your opportunity.
The Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program (CMU/WSP) provides undergraduate students from any department or major the opportunity to live, intern, and study in the nation's capital.

From embassies to nongovernmental organizations, think tanks to advocacy organizations, government agencies to congressional offices, and consulting firms to media outlets, Washington, DC, is the center for many political, international relations, and public policy activities. Students in the program come into direct contact with political, business, and industry-specific leaders and learn about the most pressing policy issues of the day.
Through this experiential learning program, CMU/WSP participants develop professional and networking skills, explore how coursework connects to the real world, learn to give and receive constructive feedback in the workplace and classroom, and intentionally reflect on their learning and growth. CMIST also sponsors events and policy-oriented opportunities in Washington for students participating in the program to further enrich their experience and enhance their understanding of how Washington functions as a hub of international and domestic policy making.
