The Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) is a 16-20 month (3-4 semesters) program that includes technology, business, and innovation, preparing the next generation of information and communication technology (ICT) leaders in Africa. The program is for students interested in an interdisciplinary curriculum that covers key topics in data science, cybersecurity, software engineering, and networks, among others.
## MSIT program objectives
  1. To equip students with technical ICT knowledge and enhance their systematic problem-solving skills to create and innovate sustainable solutions to African and global problems
  2. To empower students to identify and exploit opportunities for the application of ICT solutions to societal challenges
  3. To equip students with essential skills in communication, presentation, leadership, and teamwork to work effectively in multicultural environments


## MSIT tracks
The MSIT degree curriculum offers three different areas of focus. All three tracks lead to the same MSIT degree and are distinguished by the coursework and the type of project completed as part of the degree.
The professional track
The research track
The entrepreneurial track
## Possible career paths for MSIT graduates
Graduates of the MSIT program possess a diverse set of skills and deep understanding of IT principles, preparing them for various career opportunities in both technical and managerial roles. Whether they choose to pursue technical roles, leadership positions, or entrepreneurial ventures, the MSIT program equips students with the knowledge, skills, and flexibility to succeed in a rapidly evolving field and pursue rewarding careers in various sectors. The following are some common career paths pursued by MSIT graduates:
  * Software developer/engineer:
  * Data scientist:
  * Cybersecurity consultant:
  * Technology strategy consultant:
  * Ph.D. candidate:
  * Research and development:
  * Entrepreneurship/startup founders:


## Graduation requirements for the MSIT degree
What are units?
Carnegie Mellon University uses units instead of credits to indicate the average number of hours required per week for a full-semester course. A nine-unit class requires nine hours of work a week on the course.
To complete the MSIT degree, students are required to complete 144 units, but no more than 168, and a cumulative quality point average of at least 3.0 (i.e., a B grade in each course) by passing several core across the core thematic areas, domain courses, and elective courses in addition to a project course and a mandatory three-month master’s internship.
All MSIT students are required to take 72 units of MSIT core courses and 36 units of domain courses as outlined in the curriculum. It is mandatory for students to select 12 units from each of the six core areas for a total of 72 units. The six core areas are:
  1. Software Engineering
  2. Applied Machine Learning
  3. Cybersecurity
  4. Network Technologies
  5. IT Entrepreneurship
  6. Leadership and Professional Skills
