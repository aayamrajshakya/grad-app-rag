## Bio
I graduated from Swarthmore College with High Honors in Math and Econ. Now at MSCF, I aim to bring my quantitative foundation to a trading role in proprietary trading.  
  
As an avid angler who once landed a 38-inch striped bass in Boston Harbor, I approach markets the same way I approach the water: rigorous scouting, precise preparation, and relentless patience. That mindset helped me build a five-strategy portfolio that placed 14th out of 9,000 teams in the 2024 IMC Trading Competition, and captain an ICPC team to two regional awards. In academic research, I developed a generative sampling model that outperformed frontier benchmarks.  
  
On the trading floor, my competitive background gives me an edge in making fast, accurate decisions, while my research experience has trained me to implement-from backtesting frameworks to production-level strategies. Let's connect on LinkedIn or on Zoom so I can show how my insight, execution, and composure can lift your desk.
