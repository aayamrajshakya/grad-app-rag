The College of Engineering is excited to offer a new first-of-its-kind program in Artificial Intelligence Engineering. At Carnegie Mellon, we are known for building breakthrough systems in engineering through advanced collaboration. Our new degrees combine the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning with engineering domain knowledge, allowing students to deepen their AI skills within engineering constraints and propel their careers.
## Introducing the next generation of AI in Engineering
Engineers build on a solid mathematical and natural science foundation to design and implement solutions to problems in our society. Artificial Intelligence and its varied branches (pattern recognition, machine learning, robotics, automated planning, computer vision, natural language processing, and so on) provide an unprecedented foundation for engineers to build systems that can perceive, plan, and interact with the world to achieve design goals. However, few programs train engineers to develop and apply AI-based solutions within an engineering context.
The​ Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence​ Engineering degrees (MS AIE) take AI and embed it into engineering frameworks, including engineering representations, applications within engineered systems, and discipline-specific interpretations of system outcomes. Within these frameworks, students will learn to invent, tune, and specialize AI algorithms and tools for engineering systems.
