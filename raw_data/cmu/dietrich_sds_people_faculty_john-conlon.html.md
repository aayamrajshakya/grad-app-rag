## Bio
I’m a behavioral economist who uses experiments to explore how people form and act on their expectations, sometimes with applications to labor markets and education choices. Much of my work explores the role of attention and memory in belief formation and decision-making.
## Education
I received my Ph.D. in Business Economics from Harvard University and a bachelor’s degree in economics and philosophy from The Ohio State University. Before coming to CMU, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the economics department at Stanford University.
