### Federal Tax Information Corrections
Federal tax information transferred directly from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) cannot be changed on an online FAFSA form. If you filed an IRS Form 1040-X amended return, contact Carnegie Mellon (Office of Admission for first-year students or The HUB for enrolled/returning students) to discuss whether it would be appropriate for the school to adjust the information on your FAFSA form.
#  CSS Profile
## Undergraduate students are required to complete a CSS Profile if applying for institutional (Carnegie Mellon) financial aid programs. The CSS Profile is not required if applying only for federal financial aid.
### [Complete the CSS Profile](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org)
You can check on the status of your application in your My Student Aid portal. 
### CSS Profile Fee Waiver
Submitting the CSS Profile costs $25 for the first submission and $16 for each additional submission. If this fee creates a barrier to submitting the CSS Profile, please contact the Office of Admission or The HUB to request a fee waiver.

##  Noncustodial Parent CSS Profile & Waiver
A noncustodial parent is typically the parent the student did not live with most of the time during the past year. Carnegie Mellon requires that a student's custodial parent information be submitted with the student's CSS Profile submission, and that their noncustodial parent submits their own CSS Profile via a separate account.[Find more details](https://cssprofile.collegeboard.org/profile-for-parents)
The noncustodial parent will be charged a $25 fee regardless of the number of colleges requiring the information. We may be able to waive the noncustodial parent CSS Profile requirement in certain situations, such as:
  * No contact or support ever received from your noncustodial parent
  * Legal orders that limit the noncustodial parent's contact with you
  * Abuse situations involving you and the noncustodial parent


Types of waiver requests that are usually not considered include:
  * A parent who refuses to complete the CSS Profile
  * A divorce decree stating that a parent is not responsible for the student's educational expenses. 


If you are a prospective student, please complete this form and reach out to the Office of Admission about their waiver request.Returning/enrolled students should complete this form and reach out to their HUB Liaison about their waiver request. 
## Note: Graduate students do not need to complete a CSS Profile as part of their financial aid application.
# Additional CSS Profile Details:
  * Carnegie Mellon’s CSS College Code is 2074.
  * Have your 2024 tax returns and financial documents available for the 26-27 CSS Profile.
  * If you do not have a College Board account, you will need to create one in order to complete your CSS Profile application. Carnegie Mellon receives your data electronically from CSS, so there is no need to send copies. 
  * Print the acknowledgement upon completion and print a copy of the Profile for your own reference.
