# Research
The Henninger lab explores mechanisms by which RNA regulates cell fate in health and disease. Active genes are crowded with RNA molecules that can participate in gene regulation. These RNA molecules can mediate molecular interactions and act as scaffolds or regulators of large assemblies of proteins involved in transcription and RNA processing. Our lab uses a combination of molecular biology, soft-matter physics, and super-resolution imaging to investigate how RNA regulates genes and contributes to cell fate. We aspire to uncover fundamental mechanisms solving mysteries in gene control, inspiring the development of new RNA-based therapies, and helping us understand how RNA defects contribute to human disease.
