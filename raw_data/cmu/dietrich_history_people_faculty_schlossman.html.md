## Bio
Steven Schlossman is a social and policy historian and since 2014 has been the department’s Director of Undergraduate Studies (he also directs the Ethics, History, and Public Policy program). He specializes in a variety of topics in 19th and 20th century U.S. history, including education, childhood, and parenting; juvenile and criminal justice and corrections; the politics of military recruitment; and the history of sports. His current teaching centers on the capstone research seminar for undergraduates in Social & Political History, and various electives in the history of sports, education, juvenile justice, and classical music.
  
Schlossman’s current research centers in two areas: the history of golf, with a particular focus on major championships held at nearby Oakmont Country Club during the past century, and the evolution of juvenile justice institutions in the first half of the 20th century, with a focus on Southern California.
  
Steven Schlossman was the 2016-17 winner of Dietrich College's top teaching prize, the [Elliott Dunlap Smith Award for Distinguished Teaching and Educational Service](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/faculty-staff/college-awards/). He delivered the [2017 Honors Convocation](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/docs/current/steven-schlossman-honors-keynote.pdf) address for Dietrich College during graduation weekend, and the [departmental keynote address](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/) on May 21, 2017. He also delivered a keynote talk, “[Joel Tarr: Applied Historian](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/history/people/faculty/docs/schlossman-joel-tarr-9-Nov-2017.pdf),” to mark Professor Tarr’s 50th anniversary at Carnegie Mellon University (November 9, 2017).
  
Before coming to Carnegie Mellon, Schlossman was on the research staffs of the RAND Corporation (Santa Monica), the California State Department of Justice, and the California State Assembly. He was also on faculty at the University of Chicago, Harvard University, and UCLA, and has been a visiting fellow on educational policy at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University.
