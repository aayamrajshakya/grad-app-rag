#  Research 
I am interested in deciphering the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying the evolution of phenotypes that differ between mammals. This interest is motivated by previous work indicating that protein-coding differences between mammals cannot fully explain the evolution of many mammalian phenotypes, such as brain size and longevity, suggesting that these phenotypes have evolved in large part due to differences between species in the activity of enhancers, genomic regions that regulate transcription, which are often tissue-specific.
To pursue this interest, I led the development of a framework for associating differences between species in enhancer activity in a tissue of interest with the evolution of a phenotype of that tissue. This work led me to join the Zoonomia Consortium, a consortium of evolutionary biologists who are sequencing and analyzing hundreds of mammalian genomes, through which I have started collaborations with experts in multiple mammalian phenotypes. I aim to use these collaborations to apply my framework to a wide range of phenotypes while simultaneously developing computational methods to improve my framework and designing experiments to validate hypotheses generated by my work.
