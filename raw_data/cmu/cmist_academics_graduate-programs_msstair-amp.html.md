Graduates from the MS STAIR-AMP program will have a diverse skill set that prepares them to be successful in governmental or non-governmental positions. It will also give graduates a strategic advantage toward leadership positions focused on intersections between emerging technologies, international security, and policymaking. 
Some specific career trajectories could include: Policy Analysis and Writing; NGO & Governmental Program Management; Public Service Official; Research Associates; Regional Affairs Specialist; Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Associates; Public Relations; Government Affairs and Relations, Global Operations, Advocacy Associate, Social Impact Analysis, Campaign Manager; International Education Advisor; Strategic Director; etc.
## What professional development resources are available to MS STAIR-AMP students?
The [Career and Professional Development Center](https://www.cmu.edu/career/) is a resource available to all CMU students. They offer one-on-one advising with career consultants and peer mentors on a regular basis, in addition to giving students access to the Handshake professional social networking platform. They also provide ample resources for career exploration, resume/cover letter writing, alumni mentorship, and scheduled career fair events and preparation.
In addition, students will meet regularly with the CMIST graduate program manager to strategize internship and post-graduation placements, finalize application documents, and practice interview skills. 
Finally, every fall semester, CMIST holds an Internship Application Workshop to create a deliberate time and space for students to focus their attention on internship applications and eventual post-graduation plans within the MS STAIR-AMP career fields.
## Can I be fully or partially remote for the curricular semesters of the program? 
Most of the MS STAIR-AMP classes are only offered in-person and CMIST’s policy is that current students can enroll in only one fully online course a semester. For these reasons, a student would not be able to enroll as fully or partially remote for the MS STAIR-AMP program. 
## Are there part-time enrollment options for the MS STAIR-AMP? 
The department’s preference would be that all students remain full-time for the duration of the program. Any part-time enrollment options will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Any interest in part-time enrollment options should be communicated to the graduate program manager early in the application process.
## Can I begin the MS STAIR-AMP in the spring or summer semester instead of fall? 
The MS STAIR-AMP admits students only in the fall semester. No initial enrollment in spring or summer will be considered.
## Can international students apply to the MS STAIR-AMP?
Of course! However, MS-STAIR-AMP applicants must be enrolled CMU undergraduates who have completed or will soon complete the Carnegie Mellon University Washington Semester Program (CMU/WSP) during their undergraduate coursework. We will work with all international students on internship placement because some CMU/WSP internships require US citizenship. Students are eligible to use Curricular Practical Training (CPT) to facilitate their internship only after completing two full-time consecutive semesters. The Office of International Education is an important resource for all prospective and current international students at CMU.
