During his studies, he also spent a year at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he honed his statistical skills through graduate-level courses. Harold applied his knowledge on both the sell side and the buy side of the financial industry. On the sell side, Harold interned at CITIC Securities, where he developed a strategy tracking first-time fund manager appointments, resulting in a cumulative outperformance of 250% over ten years. He also applied Kalman filtering and machine learning techniques to enhance public mutual fund position measurements, reducing errors by 20%. On the buy side, Harold worked at DeepTrading, a cryptocurrency proprietary trading firm. He developed a Nautilus-based backtesting system using Python and Cython, efficiently testing various trading strategies, including Limited Orderbook Imbalance and Grid trading. In his free time, Harold is also a popular financial content creator on BiliBili, China's largest knowledge-based video-sharing platform. His channel, which has over 4,500 followers and 170,000 views, simplifies complex financial concepts for retail investors and aims to promote quantitative thinking in China.
