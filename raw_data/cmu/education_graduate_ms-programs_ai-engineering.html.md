Harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the field of engineering by enabling advanced data analysis, optimization algorithms, and predictive modeling for more efficient and sustainable infrastructure design and management.
The M.S. AI Engineering in CEE degree offers the opportunity to master AI integration in engineering design and domain knowledge. The program includes core courses in machine learning, deep learning, AI systems and toolchains, and engineering ethics/policy considerations. As the first program of its kind in the nation, graduates of this program are uniquely positioned for high-demand careers in this burgeoning field of CEE.
In addition to AI fundamentals, students can choose from a broad set of elective courses and a capstone project course within our CEE [focus areas](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/research/index.html).
  * Units required
    * 108 units
  * Length of program
    * 3 semesters


## Required courses
