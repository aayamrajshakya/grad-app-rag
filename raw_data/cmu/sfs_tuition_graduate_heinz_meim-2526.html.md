  * Students may choose to borrow for non-tuition costs like room and board, even though these costs are not charged to the student account.
  * A laptop computer with an additional estimated cost of $1,500 is required. Students may make a one-time request to borrow up to $1,500 to cover the documented purchase of a laptop computer for school use.
  * A student must be enrolled for at least 36 units to be considered full-time. A student enrolled for less than 36 units is charged the per unit tuition rate ($800 in 2025-26).
  * Some costs will vary based upon personal budget and individual spending preferences.
  * If you are married and/or have dependents and you anticipate your costs being higher than listed in the budget for your program, please emailthehub@andrew.cmu.edu.


* Estimated Loan Fees listed in the cost of attendance only apply to students who file a FAFSA. These fees will be included in the cost of attendance when calculating federal aid eligibility. The fees are not applicable to students who do not borrow federal loans.
## Health Insurance
Health insurance fees vary. Full-time students will be assessed an annual fee to cover the cost of the basic health insurance plan offered by the university. The fee will be waived for students who provide the university with verification of health care coverage from another source. Students will also be given the opportunity to increase coverage and will receive information concerning plan options and prices from the university prior to enrollment. All questions about student health insurance should be directed to [University Health Services](http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/).
