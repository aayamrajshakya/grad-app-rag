# Diplomacy and Statecraft
## Course Number: 84-662 
Diplomacy and statecraft are the driving forces behind foreign policy and international politics. Students are first introduced to the concepts, theories, and history of international negotiation and modern diplomacy. Students examine key historical cases and profile modern diplomatic leaders. Finally, the class surveys ongoing diplomatic challenges related to engaging rogue regimes, major power relations with Russia and China, Israeli-Palestinian conflict, human rights promotion, and climate change. Both in the classroom and in writing, students are encouraged to think, act, and write like diplomats and to appreciate diplomacy as a vocation. Throughout the course, students build skills in foreign policy memo writing, participate in diplomatic role-playing simulations, build cultural intelligence, and connect diplomatic trend lines with today’s international headlines.
