## Bio
Advait graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in 2024 with both a Masters degree in mathematics and a Bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science. During his undergraduate studies, he developed a strong foundation in real, complex, functional, and harmonic analysis, with a focus on its applications to discrete math, probability, algorithms, and even machine learning. Advait became more interested in finance after spending a summer at Citadel as a quantitative research intern, where he worked to extract signals related to oil demand from satellite-collected emissions datasets. Advait joined the MSCF program to gain a solid foundation in finance so he can pursue a career in quantitative research or quantitative trading.
