# Process systems engineering
As we advance the area of systems engineering, our goal is to develop new mathematical models and computational capabilities in:
  * large-scale nonlinear and dynamic optimization
  * mixed-integer linear and nonlinear optimization
  * optimization under uncertainty (stochastic, robust)
  * high-performance and scientific computing
  * machine learning and data science


Examples of current application areas include:
  * optimal process synthesis, design, operations, and control
  * supply chain, scheduling, planning, and enterprise-wide optimization
  * sustainable processes and circular economies
  * carbon capture and climate change
  * energy systems, renewables, and critical infrastructure
  * recovery of rare-earth elements and critical minerals
  * materials design and optimization

* ### Sampriti Chattopadhyay
My current study addresses the challenge of determining the optimal retrofit decarbonization strategy for existing fossil-based refineries. Starting from a process flowsheet representing current operations in the industry, I incorporate decarbonization alternatives into a comprehensive superstructure. By using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to optimize the superstructure, the research identifies a cost-effective decarbonization plan that enables meeting emission targets set by the company. The results provide valuable insights into the economic feasibility of retrofit electrification strategies.

* ### Carolina Colombo Tedesco
I am developing computational frameworks to investigate a promising technique called Dynamic or Programmable Catalysis. I am exploring methods to simulate these systems and identify the ideal oscillation conditions that make the technique most effective. The research aims to guide experimentalists in designing devices and systems to take full advantage of this approach.

* ### Jason Yao
I am designing membrane diafiltration systems for the recovery of critical minerals and materials under uncertainty. My work focuses on utilizing robust optimization methods to create systems that can maintain performance requirements across a variety of uncertain situations. These robust process designs can help establish reliable supplies of critical minerals with reduced risks of disruptions.

* ### Yu-Shan Chang
My research focuses on the rational co-design of chemical processes and microporous materials that are employed in these processes as adsorbents, filters, or catalysts, among other functions. While materials and processes are often developed separately, doing so simultaneously can expose synergies that could not otherwise be reached via the traditional design paradigm. In my research, I integrate numerical optimization, machine learning, and molecular simulation, among other computational approaches, to identify novel material-process pairs among the astronomical potential combinations that can be envisioned.
