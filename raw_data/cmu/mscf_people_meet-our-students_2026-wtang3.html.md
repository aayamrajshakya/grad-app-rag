## Bio
Wenyuan (William) Tang graduated from the University of Toronto (UofT) in 2024 with a degree in Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science (Major in Engineering Math, Stats, and Finance). During his undergraduate study, he has done multiple research and course projects in mathematical optimization in a financial setting and developed a huge interest in the intersection of mathematics and finance. Prior to joining the MSCF program, he interned at CPP Investments as a senior intern analyst in the trading team, where he developed tools to automate P&L calculation and generation as well as a Python detector to spot crossing opportunities between internal trading accounts. During his studies at UofT, he also worked on two summer research projects on (1) portfolio optimization using various financial optimization models and (2) calculating sensitivities of various parameters for an insurance portfolio. William joined the MSCF program to meet brilliant peers and to further hone his knowledge in the quantitative finance field. He is passionate about the research aspect of quant and looks forward to solving some of the challenging problems.
