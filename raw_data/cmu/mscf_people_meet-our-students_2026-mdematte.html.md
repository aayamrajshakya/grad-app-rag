## Bio
Since my first year of middle school, I have always been passionate for computer programming. At the beginning, I started studying and specializing in C++ and Python but, my curiosity also led me to explore other programming languages, such as: Java, MATLAB and Julia. Over the last few years, especially thanks to the pandemic, I discovered a fascination for economics, prompting me to pursue an undergraduate course in Economics and Finance at Bocconi University. However, I never abandoned my love for computer science, continuously building personal projects, delving into complex related subjects (e.g., Information Theory, Reinforcement Learning and Algorithmic Game Theory) and, engaging with Computer Science professors. My multifaceted approach allows me to draw intriguing parallels between different fields, such as: physics and finance or demography and game theory. Now, I aspire to channel this set of skills into a career as a Quantitative Researcher, developing sophisticated models and leveraging mathematics to create substantial value.
