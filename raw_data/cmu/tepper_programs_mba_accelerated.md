Specifically designed for students with previous business coursework, discover how you can earn the same esteemed MBA degree in a shortened time frame.
> Well, I chose the accelerated program because I majored in business for my undergrad degree. I had a lot of those credits already and I could study what I’m passionate about here at the Tepper School. My concentrations are in strategy, entrepreneurship and operations and after I graduate I plan to pivot to strategy within my current employer and pursue some entrepreneurial ventures, staying connected with the Swartz Center.
