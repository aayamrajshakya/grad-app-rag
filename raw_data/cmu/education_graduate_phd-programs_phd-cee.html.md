## Program structure
### Direct entry
Direct entry Ph.D. students holding an undergraduate degree in engineering or a related technical field from an accredited institution can apply directly for the program. Direct entry students can complete the requirements for the M.S. degree before beginning Ph.D. studies.
### Advanced entry 
If you already hold a master’s degree in engineering or a related technical field, you may enter the program as an advanced entry student and begin your PhD studies immediately.
### Length of program
Typically, your Ph.D. will require at least four years of graduate study beyond your B.S. degree or three years beyond your M.S. degree. This duration allows you to deeply engage in research, advanced coursework, and comprehensive examinations.
### Course requirements
We offer flexibility in our curriculum to accommodate diverse research interests. There are no formal course requirements for your Ph.D. program, though most students choose to take relevant courses that align with their chosen [focus area](https://cee.engineering.cmu.edu/research/index.html). These courses can help you prepare for your qualifying comprehensive exam and enhance your knowledge base in your research field.
### Research
Our program encourages you to be independent and creative in your research. While much of the research is faculty-led, you are encouraged to think independently about your research questions and approaches. We foster an environment where you can collaborate with faculty on existing research projects or propose new research directions.
### Thesis
As part of the qualification process, you will assemble a doctoral committee that will provide guidance and support from the initial thesis proposal stage all the way through to your thesis defense.
