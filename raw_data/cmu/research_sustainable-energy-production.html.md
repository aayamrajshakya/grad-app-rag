## Sustainable energy production, conversion, and storage
Clean energy needs could be met by using sunlight for splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen. Efficient energy conversion could be accomplished by using novel magnetic materials or ultra-wide band gap semiconductors for power devices.
Research in this area includes a focus on materials for batteries, magnetic power components, power electronics, semiconductors, LEDs, fuel cells, solar thermal storage, and more.
