#  Education 
D.A. in Mathematics, Carnegie Mellon University  
M.S. in Mathematics, Carnegie Mellon University
#  Research 
My main interests are teaching and mathematical exposition. Aside from teaching calculus, teaching optimization or operations research is my main teaching responsibility. I have written the text used in our optimization course for business majors, and brought out an improved custom published version for local use. The text has also been used at Northwestern University and Hamilton College.
