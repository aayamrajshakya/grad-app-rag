# SCS Dean's Advisory Committees
The Dean's Advisory Committees are groups of individuals from different constituencies in SCS who meet regularly to discuss challenges and opportunities that they experience at CMU. The groups meet periodically with the dean to suggest solutions and ideas on an advisory basis. Participation in these groups is voluntary.
