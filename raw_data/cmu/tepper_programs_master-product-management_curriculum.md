Designed By Product Managers, For Product Managers
It is a common assumption that a management or technology degree is needed to become a successful product manager. In reality, great product managers have skills that reach far beyond business and technology.
Our curriculum was designed by product managers, for product managers. In this program, you will learn how to creatively solve problems, allowing you to stand apart as a manager who is able to find solutions to any issue. In addition to teaching technology, business, and leadership, we go a step further by incorporating design and a modern focus on AI.

Of course, all of the above share in Carnegie Mellon’s renowned reputation globally.
## Gain Practical, Hands-On Experience
Our program helps individuals get started in the industry by providing practical, hands-on experience that takes your resume to the next level.
Internships
  
During the summer semester, you will participate in an internship program that will provide you with valuable experience and the opportunity to practice what you have learned in your coursework. This is your opportunity to truly impress and gain hands-on experience.
Capstones
  
During the fall semester, you will put your problem-solving skills to work for real clients through our capstone program. Sponsor companies are chosen from an array of industries including healthcare, robotics, finance, e-commerce, non-governmental organizations, cybersecurity, advertising technology, big data, big tech, and more.
Personalized Coaching
  
True leaders are not born—they are made. A key feature of the MS in Product Management curriculum is access to personalized leadership coaching through the Tepper School’s Accelerate Leadership Center (ALC).
  * Are you struggling with conflict on a team project?
  * Are you unsure of how to persuade your boss during your internship?
  * Do you need advice on how to clearly present an idea?


The ALC will empower you to show up as a confident, adaptable, and empathetic leader through an array of services such as one-on-one coaching, leadership development workshops, and emotional intelligence assessments.
> I would recommend the ALC to every person at Tepper. ALC helps make you a much better person and this helps you fulfill your leadership potential. They start by working on EQ and buiId up to whatever it is that you need to work on.
