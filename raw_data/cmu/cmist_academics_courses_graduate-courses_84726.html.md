# Advanced International Relations
## Course Number: 84-726 
Although there may appear to be a large gap between academic international relations (IR) theory and real-world foreign policy choices, the two are, in fact, closely related. Competing theories about how IR works drive fundamental disagreements about the optimal foreign policy. In this class, we will study the nexus between theory and policy. First, we will assess core debates in IR theory. These include the extent to which cooperation is possible versus conflict being inevitable; the importance of material “hard” power relative to other factors such as ideas and norms, international institutions, regime type, economics, and “soft” power; whether having a dominant state stabilizes or destabilizes the international system; and whether the causes of war and peace are best explained at the international level of analysis (characteristics of the international system that affect all states), state level of analysis (characteristics that vary across states), or individual level of analysis (characteristics that vary across leaders). Second, we will consider the implications of prominent IR theories for contemporary policy debates. Third, we will empirically evaluate these theories to assess the extent to which they should guide policy. Since this is a graduate-level seminar, students will take a leading role in class discussions. By the end of the semester, students will understand the central debates in IR theory, be better able to evaluate empirical evidence supporting theoretical claims, and be equipped to identify the links between theory and policy.
