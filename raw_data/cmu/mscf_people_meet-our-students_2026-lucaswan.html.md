## Bio
I completed my undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Data Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am highly interested in leveraging quantitative methods for investment. My interdisciplinary studies in statistics, data science, and computer science have equipped me with proficiency in C++ data structures and algorithms, Python (pandas, numpy, TensorFlow, PyTorch), R, SQL, and other programming languages and database tools. I have rich experience in quantitative investment, focusing on multi-factor machine learning, deep learning, daily and intra-day high-frequency alpha factor mining, cross-sectional long-short strategies during my internship in quantitative private equity and brokerage firms' financial engineering research groups. Driven by a curiosity for the unknown and a spirit of exploration, coupled with the courage and determination to solve problems, I am prepared to become a quantitative researcher in the MSCF program this fall.
