## Building remarkable functionality
Artificial intelligence is disrupting the field of engineering. We are leading this transformation by inventing AI-orchestrated systems.
This shift is driving the creation of the new discipline of AI Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. These systems are developed by simultaneously designing a system’s functionality, including both its AI algorithms and the platform on which the AI runs, to create powerful systems that are more adaptable, resilient, and trustworthy.

## AI Engineering principles
We invent AI algorithms that leverage the constraints of the systems they are embedded in to run better and faster.
These systems are built to be more adaptable, resilient, and trustworthy.
Realizing the potential of AI depends not just upon new advances in AI algorithms and technology—it depends critically on the engineering of AI into systems.
  * AI must be engineered in from the start
  * Domain expertise is key
  * Solutions must be developed within ethical constraints


## AI Engineering pillars
### Engineering of AI mechanisms
  * Engineering compute, sensors, architectural constructs, specialized algorithms and software to orchestrate AI into systems


### AI in engineered systems
  * Build AI-orchestrated products and services that are more functional, safe, secure, and resilient


### Redefining the engineering discipline with AI
  * Much as computer-aided design and modeling did in the past, AI is the process of reshaping the way engineers work and the way they approach problems.


### Teaching AI Engineering
  * Teach the state-of-the-art knowledge in AI from a unique engineering perspective. [See our master’s degrees in AI Engineering](https://engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-studies/programs/ms-aie.html). 


## Core areas of AI research
Generative AI: There will continue to be a significant evolution in generative AI and the way it is developed to integrate with systems. 
Autonomous physical systems: AI will enable radical transformation in our cyber and physical worlds. 
Future of manufacturing: Carnegie Mellon University is combining its strengths in AI and machine learning with metals additive manufacturing to make the technology viable to scale up for industry. 
New device connectivity: CMU Engineering researchers are designing next-generation intelligent edge networks that are efficient, reliable, robust, and secure. 
Human life assistance: AI has already unlocked new opportunities to improve human lives. 
Energy and environment: In addition to health and medical applications, our researchers are using artificial intelligence to solve pressing challenges such as increasing energy and water needs. 
Cybersecurity: Researchers are focused on advancing research in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI), in which computers can “learn” trends from massive collections of data. 
Human+AI design: Big design problems require creative and exploratory decision making, a skill at which humans excel.
