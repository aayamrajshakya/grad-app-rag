# Advanced materials processing and manufacturing
Everything that is made for a specific purpose is manufactured from one or more materials. The performance of each part depends on the choice of material and its properties, both at the composition and microstructural levels.

## Advanced materials processing and manufacturing
Our researchers are contributing to advancements in controlling microstructure, characterizing and processing materials, and advanced manufacturing. We are leaders in 3D printing metals and 3D characterization. Collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Mellon College of Science, School of Computer Science, and industry national laboratories happens regularly in this area.
Some focuses of advanced materials processing and manufacturing include:
  * Additive manufacturing
  * Steelmaking
  * 3D and High-throughput characterization
  * Orientation imaging
  * SEM/TEM
  * Tomography
  * Confocal microscopy
  * Quantitative image analysis
