# Accelerated Masters
Carnegie Mellon University undergraduates in any majors and other eligible students, such as those from the Pittsburgh Council on Higher Education (PCHE), who have completed the appropriate courses may be eligible to enroll in the Accelerated Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences (A-METALS) program.
### About the Accelerated Masters Program
The HCII offers a three-semester (12-month), 11-course Master of Educational Technology and Applied Learning Sciences. Undergraduates who have taken the three core METALS courses (05823 E-Learning Design Principles and Methods, 05738 Evidence-Based Educational Design, and 05360 Interaction Design Fundamentals), and optionally one METALS elective at the 400 level or above, will be considered eligible for the Accelerated Masters program. 
These students will be allowed to complete the master’s degree in as little as two semesters (8 months) after their undergraduate degree, instead of the usual three semesters (12 months).
The bottom row in the table below describes how to move from the CMU undergraduate program into and through the master’s program. Students who want to be considered for the accelerated master’s program should apply to the HCII by October of their senior year. Decisions will be made in time for spring registration week.
| Fall I | Spring | Summer | Fall II  
---|---|---|---|---  
StandardMaster |  05823 E-Learning Design Principles and Methods  
05738 Evidence-Based Educational Design  
05660 Interaction Design Fundamentals  
Two Electives |  05840 Tools for Online Learning  
05681 METALS Project I  
Three Electives | 05682 METALS Project II |   
| (Undergrad Senior Year or earlier) | (Undergrad Senior Year) | Summer After Graduation | Fall  
AcceleratedMaster |  05823 E-Learning Design Principles and Methods  
05738 Evidence-Based Educational Design  
05360 or 05660 Interaction Design Fundamentals  
One Elective |  05840 Tools for Online Learning  
05681 METALS Project I  | 05682 METALS Project II | 5 Electives   
Undergraduate seniors in their last semester begin the masters program by taking 05840 Tools for Online Learning and 05681 METALS Project I, which is the first half of the master’s-level two-semester project course. They then take 05682 METALS Project II in the summer. They finish the program in the fall semester by taking five electives to satisfy the METALS requirement. Students who have already taken optional elective courses as undergraduates that would satisfy the master’s electives must still enroll in at least four electives as master’s students.
### How to Apply
The METALS program must receive a completed application package as early as February of your junior year, but no later than October of your senior year. Admission decisions will be made on a rolling basis and emailed before spring registration begins in November. A graduate orientation program is held during the week before spring classes begin and accepted accelerated masters students are expected to attend.
Application periods for the Accelerated METALS program are open for applications during the following periods:
  * Early February – Mid-March
  * September 3 – October 27, 2025
