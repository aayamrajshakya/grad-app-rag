Assessment Structure: 
  * Standard grading: 20% for homeworks, 25% for each of the midterms, and 30% for the final.
  * Alternative minimum grade: 20% for homeworks, 15% for the lower midterm, 25% for the higher midterm, 40% for the final. Must complete at least 90% of homeworks to qualify for alternative minimum grading scheme.
