#  BESA Curriculum 
The Bachelor of Engineering Studies and Arts (BESA)intercollege degree that equally integrates the depth and breath of coursework in the College of Engineering (ENG) and the College of Fine Arts (CFA). BESA students combine their CFA concentration with a concentration in Engineering Studies, which contains several subject area options. This program of study prepares students for careers tailored to their strengths and areas of expertise that positively influences our world.
