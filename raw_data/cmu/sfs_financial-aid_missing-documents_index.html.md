Instructions for submitting documents may be found in the chart below.

# Document Submission Instructions: My Student Aid
## The documents listed below may be submitting directly to Carnegie Mellon through[My Student Aid](https://fao.andrew.cmu.edu/forms.html#/) - this is the most secure way to submit documents.
### Child Support Paid
You indicated child support paid on your CSS Profile. Submit a signed statement indicating the total amount of child support paid for the applicable tax year. Child support paid is applicable when a student's biological parents divorce/separate. It is not simply financial support provided to the student. These are payments made due to divorce, separation, or a legal requirement or agreement is reportable. 
### DD214 Form
This form may be requested to confirm whether you are or will be a qualifying veteran. The form can be requested from the Department of Veterans Affairs at[www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records](https://www.va.gov/records/get-military-service-records/).
### Death Certificate
This may be requested due to a recent death of a parent. Please submit a copy of the death certificate.
###  Disinterested Third Party Letter  

A statement from an individual providing information on the student/parent's situation. Most commonly, this is requested for students pursuing Unusual Circumstances (dependency status change), to confirm dependency status reported on their FAFSA, or Noncustodial Parent Waiver supporting documents. Typically, statements are provided by a teacher/faculty member, school counselor, academic advisor, medical authority, member of the clergy, prison administrator or government agency/court.
### Divorce/Separation Documentation
If you (or your parent) have experienced a recent divorce/separation, then you are required to submit documentation that confirms the divorce/separation. This may include one of the following:
  * Legal Separation/Divorce Decree Document: Submit a copy of your divorce decree/certificate.
  * Document to Demonstrate Separation: Submit documentation that shows the individuals (parents) are no longer living together and maintaining separate lives. An example could be copies of mortgage/rental agreements that show the individuals are living/maintaining separate households.


### FAFSA Release Authorization
The Department of Education requires all institutions to ensure the consistency of data related to a student's Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Before disbursing Federal Student Aid funds, all data discrepancies and conflicting information must be resolved. If you received a request for either a parent or student FAFSA Release Authorization, we have found conflicting information between your FAFSA and supporting documentation.
Please log in to My Student Aid to authorize Carnegie Mellon University to adjust FAFSA data in order to resolve the conflicting information between the FAFSA and other supporting documentation submitted to the university.
Parents or guardians who cannot access the authorization through My Student Aid may submit a PDF copy of the FAFSA Release Authorization: 
  * [2026-2027 Parent of Guardian FAFSA Release Authorization (pdf)](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/docs/fafsa-release-auth.pdf)
