# BHA Program
The Bachelor of Humanities and Arts (BHA)
The BHA curriculum has three main components: general education requirements, fine arts concentration requirements and humanities/social sciences concentration requirements. Students must complete an array of courses defined by their chosen concentrations. Each student's course of study is unique, based on their background and interests, and course availability in the respective colleges.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and DC. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in DC to guide their focus in the humanities or social/behavioral sciences.
