## Bio
During my undergraduate studies at UNC, I juggled multiple responsibilities while double majoring in Economics and Statistics, and minoring in Computer Science. In addition to applying for MFE programs, I completed four internships at different business firms, serving as a quant researcher for alpha strategy in two of them. I also worked as an undergraduate learning assistant for a computer science course and was an active member of the HOX fraternity. Balancing these commitments wasn't easy, but the academic rigor, discipline, and time management skills I developed have prepared me well for my upcoming role as a quant strategist at MSCF this Fall. If you are looking to hire a Summer quant intern who is strong in coding and statistical analysis, and passionate about quant research, feel free to directly message me or email me at devinl@andrew.cmu.edu.
Fun Fact: I'm a big fan of all kinds of intellectual games. I can solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube in 15 seconds and excel at the game of Go.
