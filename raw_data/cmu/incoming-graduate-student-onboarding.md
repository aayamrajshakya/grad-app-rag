### Design Skills Workshop
_Complete Survey: early-June_  
 _Summer 2025- TBA (6 weeks, web-based via Zoom)_
Design Skills Workshop (DSW) is a 3-unit mini summer course (#48-689) for incoming Architecture master’s students to establish a baseline of digital design skills appropriate to the expectations of the design culture at the School of Architecture._All incoming Graduate Program students must complete the DSW Survey using their active Andrew ID._ As indicated in the admission letter, incoming students to the MAAD, M.Arch, MUD, MSSD, and MSBPD programs are required to complete DSW the summer prior to the start of their program.
DSW is an online-only series of micro workshops, assignments, and tutorials on digital design skills. Organized around short design exercises, students will demonstrate the fundamentals of 2D graphics (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), architectural drafting (Rhino), 3D modeling (Rhino), and parametric modeling (Grasshopper). The course will cover specific tools and workflows to equip students with the foundational skills for solving design problems through the use of computational tools. All students are expected to be familiar with the protocols and workflows covered in DSW.
The fully remote course will run from the end of June to early August with an anticipated time commitment of 5 hours/week. The full extent of the course must be completed in order to receive a passing grade for the course that will appear on the fall semester transcript and is included in the cost of your full-time fall tuition.
### Computing & Technology
Students are provided access to many computer labs on campus with necessary software for coursework, but students are not guaranteed computer access. Architecture facilities include a woodshop and digital fabrication lab (dFab). 
Graduate students are required to have their own laptop computers that are compatible and sufficiently powerful for coursework in the School of Architecture.
The following laptop specifications have been provided for the 2025-26 academic year:
  * CPU: 
    * Note: The CPU Space has become saturated with many models, Core i7/i9, Core Ultra 7/9, Ryzen 7/9, AI 7/9, AI MAX 7/9. As long as you’re getting the latest generation 7 or 9, these are all acceptable.
  * Memory:
  * SSD:
  * Screen Size:
  * GPU: 
  * Operating System: 
  * Warranty:  
Manufacturers that offer 3-year warranty: Dell, Lenovo, HP (also Acer and Asus with add-on purchases). Others may offer similar services, additional research is recommended.


*Mac systems do not support all of our software. Those tech savvy enough to be familiar with Windows ARM on Mac will also find incompatibilities and performance reductions. A PC running Windows native is required.
