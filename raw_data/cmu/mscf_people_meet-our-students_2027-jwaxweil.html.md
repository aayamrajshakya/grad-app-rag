## Bio
After completing high school at 16, I spent the next two years in one of France's most rigorous academic curricula, preparing for admission to its top engineering schools. Today, I am pursuing two Master of Science degrees, one in Engineering from Telecom Paris at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, with a specialization in Stochastic Calculus and Machine Learning, and the other in Computational Finance (MSCF).  
  
I am eager to share my mathematical and programming skills within a high-integrity environment. My passion for math and computer science led me to C++ competitive programming, hackathons, and, most recently, two hands-on algorithmic trading projects where I built a modular Python backtesting framework and implemented an LSTM-based forecasting model.  
  
My experience in wealth management, particularly with structured products and REITs, has fueled my motivation for quantitative finance and provided me with a competitive edge in the European market.  
  
I aim to bring my skills and passion to a quant fund or an investment firm where I can combine mathematical modeling, programming, and market insight to generate real impact, whether through alpha research to trading optimization.
