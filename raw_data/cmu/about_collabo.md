# ColLABo
## A one-of-a-kind laboratory for theater makers
ColLABo
### HOW COLLABO WORKS
Creative teams made up of four artists (which must include at least one director and one designer) who are working together on a theatrical project join us in Pittsburgh for two weeks at the end of May/early June. ColLABo 2025 will take place May 26–June 9, 2025.
### WHO IS RIGHT FOR COLLABO?
We are seeking diverse cohorts of American theater artists who are working with a particular focus on developing new stories that center marginalized voices OR reinterpretations of established plays to explore diverse perspectives. We are looking for teams that have very speciﬁc production-related challenges to explore. As a director- and designer-led process, ColLABo is meant to support productionscript
