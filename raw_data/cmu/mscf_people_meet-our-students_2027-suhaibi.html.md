## Bio
Suhaib graduated from Northeastern University in 2025 with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics and a minor in Business Administration. At Northeastern, Suhaib explored his interest in sports analytics through projects in Python and Machine Learning. This included a 7-month co-op with the Baltimore Orioles, where he built Regression algorithms to predict a baseball pitcher's performance across seasons. These experiences helped Suhaib realize his true passion in statistical problem-solving. At MSCF, he seeks to strengthen his analytical skills while learning about their data-driven applications in finance. Such steps include developing a mortgage prepayment model as an intern at Sage Residential, an alternative asset management firm. His unique background will add an innovative perspective to any quantitative research team.
