[Office of Graduate and Postdoctoral Affairs](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/index.html) › [ Resources ](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/resources/index.html) › Summary of Graduate Student Appeal and Grievance Procedures 
_Note These procedures are also set forth in the University-Wide Graduate Student Handbook in section four._
### Introduction 
Set forth below is a summary of the processes available to graduate students who seek review of academic and non-academic issues. Generally, graduate students are expected to seek informal resolution of all concerns within the applicable department, unit or program before invoking formal processes. When an informal resolution cannot be reached, however, a graduate student who seeks further review of the matter is to follow these formal procedures. To the extent that these processes are set forth in official University policies, links to those statements of policy and more detailed description of processes and procedures are included. Where a graduate student's concerns implicate multiple policies or processes, the University reserves the right to decide which process shall apply in order to avoid duplicative and potentially conflicting processes and decisions, or in appropriate circumstances, the order in which multiple reviews may occur. 
These appeal and grievance procedures shall apply to students in all graduate programs of the University. Students should refer to the online handbooks (or hard copy handbooks if applicable) for their particular programs for more detailed information about the administration and academic policies of the program. To the extent that these policies conflict in any way with policies, processes and procedures adopted at the College, Department or Program level, the policies set forth herein shall govern.
### Appealing Final Grades
Final grades will be changed only in exceptional circumstances and only with the approval of the instructor and the department, unit or program. Grading is a matter of sound discretion of the instructor and final grades are rarely changed without the consent of the instructor who assigned the grade. The following circumstances are the unusual exceptions that may warrant a grade appeal: (a) the final grade assigned for a course is based on manifest error (e.g. a clear error such as arithmetic error in computing a grade or failure to grade one of the answers on an exam), or (b) the faculty or staff member who assigned the grade did so in violation of a University policy. 
A graduate student who believes a final grade was assigned pursuant to (a) or (b) above should first present the case informally to the faculty or staff member responsible for the course in which the student believes an inappropriate grade has been awarded. If the student is not satisfied with the resolution at this first step, the student shall submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation to the head of the department in which the course was offered. Grade appeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than one year after the final course grade was issued. The department head (or the program head if the department head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her) will issue a written decision on the appeal within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as practical. If the student is not satisfied with the decision of the department head (or program head), the student may submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation, within seven (7) days to the Dean of the college in which the course is offered. The Dean shall render a decision within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as practical. The decision of the Dean shall be final and not appealable. 
Summary of Levels of Appeal for Final Grades:
  * Informal discussion with the faculty member
  * Formal written appeal to the department head (or the program head if the department head chooses to delegate the decision to him/her)
  * Formal written appeal to the Dean
  * Dean issues final non-appealable decision

### Appeal of Academic Actions
An "Academic Action" is an action by a program, unit or department based on a graduate student's academic performance or failure to satisfy academic program requirements. 
Examples of Academic Actions include, but are not limited to, academic probation, academic suspension, and dismissal/drop. Each college, department, or program may set its own academic requirements and standards for acceptable academic performance. These standards and benchmarks for performance are set forth in the online and/or hard copy handbooks for individual graduate programs.
Graduate students will be notified of an academic action in writing by the applicable department, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee. Graduate students are encouraged to seek informal resolution of any concerns related to academic actions informally within the department, unit or program before filing a formal appeal. 
Graduate students who wish to appeal an Academic Action must submit a formal, written appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Dean of the College within seven (7) calendar days after receipt of written notice of the academic action by the department, unit, or program head or director, or designated committee. The Dean may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, including but not limited to one of the Associate Deans, the College Council or a specially constituted grievance committee who shall make a recommendation to the Dean. The Dean shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. 
Graduate students who wish to appeal the decision of the Dean must submit a formal written appeal, with appropriate documentation, to the Provost within fourteen (14) calendar days after receipt of the Dean's written decision. The appeal should be submitted to provost@andrew.cmu.edu. The Provost may delegate review of the matter to another individual or committee, who shall make a recommendation to the Provost. The Provost shall render a decision on the appeal within thirty (30) days or as soon thereafter as practical. Decisions by the Provost are final and not appealable. 
Generally, sanctions resulting from an Academic Action (e.g. probation, suspension, or dismissal /drop) take effect immediately, regardless of whether an appeal is filed. In exceptional circumstances, however, the appropriate Dean or the Provost may elect to hold sanctions in abeyance pending the resolution of an appeal. 
Summary of Levels of Appeal for Academic Actions:
  * Seek informal resolution within department, unit, or program
  * Formal written appeal to the Dean
  * Decision rendered by the Dean
  * Formal written appeal to the Provost 
  * Provost issues final non-appealable decision

  

### Appeal from Academic Disciplinary Actions
Academic Disciplinary Actions are sanctions and outcomes imposed when any student violates the [University Policy on Academic integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html) including cheating, plagiarism and unauthorized assistance.
The [Office of Community Responsibility](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/ocr/) manages the Academic Disciplinary Process and provides resources to all students, faculty and staff. The process for appealing an academic integrity violation can be found under the [Academic Integrity Actions Index](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/academic-integrity-actions/index.html).
### Community Standards Violations
As members of the University community, Carnegie Mellon students are expected to respect the rights of all students, faculty and staff and adhere to the policies outlined in the Student Handbook contained in [The Word](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/index.html), the [University Policies website](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/), and any applicable college, department or graduate program handbooks.
If a student has observed a violation of university policy or law, or feels harmed by another student's misconduct (e.g. affecting his/her welfare, property, safety or security) he/she should file a report with the Dean of Student Affairs and/or University Police as appropriate.
The procedures for adjudicating community standards violations and for appealing the results are available in [The Word](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/index.html) under [Community Standards](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/community-standards/community-standards-violations.html).
