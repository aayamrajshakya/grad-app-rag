How does a person become a great rocket scientist on Wall Street? Pin-Hua (Angelina) Chen graduated from National Taiwan University in 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Accounting. During her undergraduate studies, she earned the Presidential Award (top 2%) and immersed herself in mathematics and programming. In particular, she excelled in master-level classes such as Stochastic Modeling and Econometrics, where she used a regression model to predict the cost of capital based on the ESG reports. Furthermore, she applied her strong programming skills in Python and statistical analysis expertise as a research assistant in the FinDA Research Lab, where she researched the relationship between AI adoption and M&A performance. During her internship at Klook, she built an LDA model to cluster customer reviews, resulting in a 13% increase in booking rates. At the MSCF program, Pin-Hua plans to leverage her interest in quantitative problem-solving and financial analysis. After graduation, Pin-Hua seeks a role in quantitative research or asset management, where she can bring her extensive knowledge and experience with Python and statistical modeling to help retrieve accurate and useful data in the fast-paced financial sector. She is available to meet on Zoom or chat in person to show how she can add value to your company.
