Jacqueline Speedy, Associate Dean of Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy
Heinz College is the world's elite institution for Information Technology Management. Our mission is to prepare students from around the world to make huge impacts through technology.
Technology for driving business value. 
There’s a reason our graduates command extraordinary salaries. Businesses need translators. People with both deep technology skills and the savvy to lead the change that technology offers. Our degree programs train students to think, create, and translate.
Our top-ranked **[Master of Information Systems Management (MISM)](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/index.php)** is designed to train technology leaders across all industries.
For the analytics-minded, our highly-competitive **[Business Intelligence and Data Analytics (BIDA)](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-systems-management-master/bida.php)** program prepares students to take on applied data science roles at top consulting, banking, and technology firms.
Our new **[Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence Systems Management (AIM)](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-masters/index.php) **program, housed in CMU's Heinz College, will teach you to put AI to work. Feedback from our business partners indicates that society needs leaders trained to implement AI in support of consequential, decision-making tasks—and to do so safely and equitably. This program provides the necessary blend of AI and business instruction. 
Students with relevant IT experience can earn their degree from virtually anywhere in the world with our **[Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT)](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-technology-master/index.php)** program, offering concentrations in four high-demand areas in a flexible distance-learning format.
For those with a desire to work in the critical and growing field of cybersecurity and privacy, our **[Master of Science in Information Security Policy and Management (MSISPM)](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/programs/information-security-policy-management-master/index.php)** prepares graduates for service in both the public and private sectors dealing with one of the most important challenges of our modern age.
Here at Heinz, you’ll be educated in the true interdisciplinary spirit of Carnegie Mellon University, in close proximity to CMU’s other top-ranked institutes including the College of Engineering and the School of Computer Science. The co-location with our school of Public Policy means you will learn from peers with a very human-centered perspective. It provides you with opportunities for working on projects with these peers that can have impact at societal scale. 
We seek the very brightest students who will embrace technology not for its own sake but for driving business value and, in many cases, global impact.
