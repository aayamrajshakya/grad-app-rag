## Bio
Jimmy Huang graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2024 with double majors in Mathematics + Computer Science and Statistics. During his undergraduate studies, Jimmy developed a strong interest in machine learning, time series analysis, and financial engineering, leading him to undertake several impactful internships and research projects. At JPMorgan Chase, Jimmy participated in the Quantitative Research Early Mentorship Program, collaborating with an experienced quant to explore quantitative finance concepts and improve model accuracy for price predictions by utilizing LSTM models. As a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services, he contributed to the integration and performance benchmarking of GSPMD within Annapurna Labs’ specialized ML compilation process, optimizing sharding and increasing training and inference speed. Jimmy's earlier internships include roles at State Farm and COUNTRY Financial, where he developed full-stack applications and REST APIs, significantly reducing search times for data points and manual accounting time for IT infrastructure uptime. His research in representation learning at the Illinois Risk Lab involved implementing a novel framework on an LSTM model for textual data, achieving a substantial reduction in the number of potentially important words and phrases. Driven by a passion for quantitative analysis and financial markets, Jimmy joined the MSCF program at Carnegie Mellon University to further develop his expertise in financial computing and machine learning. He aims to pursue a career in quantitative research or quantitative trading upon graduation. Outside of academics, Jimmy placed in the top 1% of over 8,000 teams in the Prosperity Trading Challenge by programming trading strategies based on mean reversion and the lead-lag effect. He also completed the Options 201 Course at Akuna Capital, gaining in-depth knowledge of options strategies, greeks, and volatility. In his free time, he enjoys playing poker, competitive video games, and table tennis.
