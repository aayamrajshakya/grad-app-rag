Exploring RNA-directed gene regulation in cell fate & disease
The Henninger Lab explores how RNA regulates gene expression at multiple scales in health and disease. We use approaches based in molecular biology, soft-matter physics, and super-resolution imaging to understand how RNA regulates its own production to direct cell fate and how RNA-mediated dysregulation contributes to human disease.

Summer Research Institute with Salma and Anish!
August 1, 2025
Salma and Anish conducted research with the lab as part of the CMU Summer Research Institute. In their project, they discovered specific RNA-binding proteins affect gene expression through their intriniscally disordered regions. Great job on the presentation to the department!
