Requirements
  * _Students should report raw university GPA scores and NOT converted scores. Please DO NOT convert your international score to a US GPA or weighted GPA or other system._
  * GRE scores are required. GRE scores are waived for applicants who have graduated from, or are enrolled at, Carnegie Mellon. **GRE scores will NOT be accepted if they are more than five years old.** **Our Institution Code is 2074; Department Code is 0402.****More information is available on the program website.**
  * The GRE At Home test is accepted but we prefer you take the GRE at a test center if possible.
  * Proof of English Language Proficiency:  
  
If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language…meaning spoken at home and from birth), we are required to formally evaluate your English proficiency. We require applicants who will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and for whom English is not a native language, to demonstrate English proficiency via one of these standardized tests: TOEFL (preferred), IELTS, or Duolingo. We discourage the use of the "TOEFL ITP Plus for China," since speaking is not scored.  
  
We do not issue waivers for non-native speakers of English. In particular, we do not issue waivers based on previous study at a U.S. high school, college, or university. We also do not issue waivers based on previous study at an English-language high school, college, or university outside of the United States. No amount of educational experience in English, regardless of which country it occurred in, will result in a test waiver.  
  
Applicants applying to MCDS are required to submit scores from an English proficiency exam taken within the last two years. Scores taken before Sept. 1, 2022, will not be accepted regardless of whether you have previously studied in the U.S. 
  * Successful applicants will have a minimum TOEFL score of 100, IELTS score of 7.5, or DuoLingo score of 120. 
  * Please send scores via ETS using our SCS/CMU codes:

    * TOEFL Department Code: 78
  * A successful applicant will normally have a total iBT score of at least 100.
