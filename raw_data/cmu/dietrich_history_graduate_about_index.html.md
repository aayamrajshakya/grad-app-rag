# About the Program
The History department has strengths in the history of science, environment, technology and medicine (hereafter STEM), broadly construed, as well as in social history, and is situated in a tech- and arts-focused university; our program therefore is focused on recruiting and training students who wish to study at the intersection of our strengths in history of STEM and social and political history and/or anthropology.
Traditionally, the phrase “social history of science” has referred to the social structures and interests of scientists; we want to reclaim the phrase to emphasize study of the way in which everyday people are intertwined with socially transformative developments in science, medicine and technology
At the same time, our capacity to train graduate students in history goes well beyond direct connections to STEM fields. Over the past thirty years, our department has trained a significant number of students for careers at the confluence of African American, urban, labor, community, and cultural history across a wide number of countries. The broad social movements and political thrust of these studies continue to capture the interests of faculty, students, and prospective applicants in their focus on the impact of poor and working-class politics and social movements as well as on questions of inequality and injustice.
Our graduate program leverages the department’s longstanding strength in social history to confront the role of scientific and medical experts in reproducing (and at times challenging) inequalities of race, class, gender, and disability. Our faculty have expertise across the history of science, technology, environment, and medicine, and our research foci include a range of national and transnational contexts. We are often looking for ways that nontraditional sources (from crop records to DNA traces) might yield important insights, and we train students to remain alert to the power dynamics that structure and organize the historical record. There is always something lost when people situated in time and place are turned into data, and our faculty are committed to advising students and projects centered on re-situating and re-embodying information. This is Carnegie Mellon’s vision of history - intellectually innovative, methodologically rigorous, and socially engaged.

Graduate Student Teaching Opportunities
Most graduate students in the department serve as Teaching Assistants after their first full year of study. The department places emphasis on preparing its graduate students to become excellent classroom teachers. Before assuming teaching responsibilities, graduate students take the Seminar on Instruction as part of the curriculum. This course focuses on the processes of teaching and learning history at the undergraduate level.  
  
Research Facilities
Beyond the the resources of The Carnegie Mellon University Libraries, graduate students also have access to the collections of the Carnegie Library, the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania and the Libraries of the University of Pittsburghthe University Libraries belong to the Partnership for Academic Library Collaboration & Innovation with its outstanding collections

# Degree Requirements and Time Table
  
The doctoral degree requires students to
  1. Complete four semesters of coursework in good standing, with a total of 12.5 courses.
  2. Complete the Oral Examination successfully.
  3. Receive approval for Dissertation Prospectus.
  4. Complete Doctoral Dissertation.

  
Curriculum  
  
Over their first two years, students take at least 12.5 courses, including "methods" courses, proseminar courses on American and Transnational history, and thematic courses (e.g., Race, Nation, and Empire; Science, Technology and the Environment; Social and Political Movements; Labor and Work). The centerpiece of the curriculum is a two-semester "Research Seminar" (including a summer of funded archival research), in which the student works closely with one or two faculty in developing a project. The course results in an article- or chapter-length piece of original scholarship in the student's primary area of interest.  
  
Because of the small nature of the program, we have built in four electives (a quarter of the total courses required) so that students can focus on their particular areas of interest. These topics might include additional Thematic Courses, Digital Humanities, "readings" courses with faculty on topics not otherwise covered in the curriculum, specially designed history courses based on undergraduate survey courses, courses in other departments and colleges at Carnegie Mellon, and/or courses at the University of Pittsburgh or other Pittsburgh-area universities.  
  
Graduate Exam and Prospectus  
  
In the third year, students take an oral exam with the three faculty supervisors, and then begin work on their dissertation prospectus in the spring of the third year.  
  
Dissertation Research and Writing  
  
Normally students conduct the bulk of their dissertation research in the fourth year, begin writing up the results of their research in the fifth year, and finish the dissertation by the end of the sixth year.

# Language Requirements
The program has no specific language requirements. However, students who plan to work in a foreign language must demonstrate in their applications that they have the requisite language skills to conduct research in their chosen field.
# Financial Aid
## General Funding
All full-time graduate students who are making good progress are fully funded by the department, up to six years. No students are funded beyond six years.
**Funding includes:**
  * tuition
  * health insurance
  * fees
  * a living stipend (as of 2024, $31,000).


## Funding Details and Support for Research
For the first year, graduate students typically receive a stipend without teaching; beginning in the second year, students typically work as teaching or research assistants in exchange for their stipends. Students also receive at least one semester free of obligations in order to conduct research and are eligible to receive one semester of funding to participate in an internship program. Additional funding is also available by application to the Graduate Studies Committee to attend conferences and workshops and to make short research trips. The History Department offers funding for short-term research trips or conference presentations.
# External Sources of Support
We encourage students to apply for external grants, and work with them on grant-writing in the Research Seminar. In recent years, students have received grants from: the German Academic Exchange Service [DAAD], the Stephen F. Cohen - Robert C. Tucker Dissertation Research Fund (CTDRF), Social Science Research Council [SSRC], Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University, Bentley Historical Library; the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center, John Carter Brown Library, Wisconsin Veterans Museum and Wisconsin Historical Society, and German Historical Institute of Pennsylvania.
# Internships
Internships allow our graduate students to gain skills and contacts that will be helpful in a variety of career paths. We relatively recently created a new internship program that allows students to receive full funding while completing a semester-long internship. Students identify potential internship hosts in collaboration with the Director of Graduate Studies. Internships may be located in Pittsburgh or elsewhere, and can be completed at museums, national parks, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, corporations, or anywhere historical research is required.
We have an ongoing relationship with the Smithsonian-affiliated Senator John Heinz History Center. Our students can work with a professional staff member from the archives, museum, or administrative divisions of the center with full stipend and a release from teaching duties. Internships can involve completing a research project based on the center's collections, developing the background for an exhibit, or working closely with staff in marketing, communications or other administrative offices of the center.
