# International Governance of Artificial Intelligence
## Course Number: 84-671 
How do global institutions seek to govern AI? This course examines AI policy from an international perspective, beginning with a concise technical overview of AI that clarifies its functions. It then outlines the existing and future regulatory challenges that governments face in balancing both the risks and rewards from AI, both within and outside national borders. The course then explores current national strategies, multilateral frameworks, and the role of non-state actors, all of which compete to shape the narratives surrounding regulation. Students will engage with key governance issues such as algorithmic bias, digital authoritarianism, international competition, and economic disruption. Ultimately, the course considers AI both as a challenge that introduces ethical, regulatory, and security risks as well as a tool that holds promise for innovation across the private and public sectors.
