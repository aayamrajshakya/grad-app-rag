My research is in the general area of partial differential equations. Most of my work has concerned kinetic models of plasma, although highly similar models are use to describe the evolution of a galaxy. In these models the Vlasov equation is used to describe the state of the particles and the Vlasov equation is coupled to another equation which describes the field under which the particles move; this is usually Poisson's equation or Maxwell's equations.
Much of my work has concerned the global existence in time of smooth solutions to such systems, but asymptotic behavior is also of interest. Some work has also been done on numerical methods and convergence results for these problems. The study of steady (in time) solutions has been of interest recently.
