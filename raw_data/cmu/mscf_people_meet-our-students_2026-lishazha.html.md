## Bio
As a passionate and driven student who loves problem-solving, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. I hold a Bachelor of Arts in Statistics and Data Science with an emphasis on Economics from the University of California, Berkeley, where I graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.89/4.00. Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken rigorous coursework, including Machine Learning, Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, Stochastic Processes, Time Series Analysis, and Financial Economics. My hands-on experience as a Student Instructor for Probability for Data Science at UC Berkeley has deepened my understanding of complex statistical concepts. My professional experiences include a role as a Quantitative Researcher Intern at YouMeiLi Fund in Shenzhen, China, where I coded Python scripts for data scraping, developed automated feature engineering programs, and designed trading strategies using machine learning models. My strategies outperformed benchmarks, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world financial markets. Additionally, as a Data Analyst Intern at ItIsOverdue in Los Angeles, I transformed raw data into interactive visualizations in Tableau, providing actionable insights through thorough analysis and experimentation with data categorization and cleaning methods. My research experiences include working as a Research Assistant under Professor Paul Gertler at UC Berkeley, where I conducted sentiment analysis and debiased machine learning to study the impact of a mini-MBA program on negotiation skills. At Stanford University, under Dr. Helen Liu, I developed a multi-factor model for HS300 stocks, performing data scraping, factor analysis, and backtesting strategies. Projects such as implementing artificial and convolutional neural networks and developing a spam email identification model have further solidified my technical expertise in Python and its relevant packages, including Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, etc. Beyond my professional pursuits, I have a wide range of interests including opera singing, photography, hiking, lifting, reading, traveling, puzzle-solving, gaming, archery, and Broadway musicals. I am fluent in English and Chinese Mandarin, with basic proficiency in Spanish. I am excited about the opportunity to connect with professionals and employers through the MSCF Website and LinkedIn, where I can share my experiences and collaborate on innovative projects.
