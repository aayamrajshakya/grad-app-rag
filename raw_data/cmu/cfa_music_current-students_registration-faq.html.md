## Cognition, Choice, and Behavior Course (Music and Technology Majors Only)
You must fulfill this requirement by passing one of the courses on [this list](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/current-students/pdf-documents/cognition-choice-and-behavior-course-list---google-docs.pdf).
## Designated Computer Courses
You must fulfill this requirement by passing Introduction to Music Technology (57-101, a music mini-course, or 57-171, a self- paced music mini-course), and Computing @ Carnegie Mellon (99-101, a university mini-course).
HINT: 
HINT: 
The expectations are identical between the two classes. The difference is that 57-101 has three times the class time to cover the same material as 57-171. The pace of 57-171 is fast; there is just enough time to cover the minimum requirements for the assignments. The pace of 57-101 is slower; there is more time to cover an additional side lesson or two, and usually time for open lab and questions.
The recommendation is to not take 57-171 unless you fit certain criteria: you have previous experience with some of the software involved; you generally are very strong with computer technology, pick up skills quickly AND have some musical training; you cannot take the course during the other section times. If you're unsure, register for 57-101.
HINT:

Search the [CMU Schedule of Classes](https://enr-apps.as.cmu.edu/open/SOC/SOCServlet) by keyword. 
## I can't register / I can't register for a course I need.
You may not be able to register for one of two reasons:
1. The School of Music put you on registration hold. (See Kate Ganczarz if you have a question.)
2. Enrollment Services coded you as ineligible to enroll or put you on registration hold. (See The Hub if you have a question.)
You may not be able to register for a class
1. Your home department or class level may be coded incorrectly. (Check SIO to confirm your department and class status. See Kate Ganczarz if you discover a discrepancy.)
2. You may be attempting to register for a class which is coded as having a prerequisite that you either haven't fulfilled or have fulfilled in a nonstandard manner; or which is coded as being for a different class level than yours; or which is coded as requiring special permission from the instructor. (See Kate Ganczarz for assistance.)
3. You may be attempting to register for a class that requires a request form (Chamber Music, Collaborative Piano, Independent Study, Keyboard Studies (Studio), or Performance for Composers).
4. You may be an undergraduate student inadvertently attempting to register for a class by using the graduate course number, or a graduate student inadvertently attempting to register for a class by using the undergraduate course number. This results in your being placed on a wait list. (Check the course number.)
5. You may be attempting to register for a class for which you have insufficient free units. If you anticipate registering for an overload class schedule, over 60 units for undergraduate students or over 48 units for graduate students, please complete and submit a registration worksheet to Kate Ganczarz, if you’re an undergraduate student or a graduate student, BEFORE you register.
6. You may be attempting to register for a class that partially or completely overlaps with the scheduled time for a class for which you’re already registered. You will need to either drop the first class, or see Kate Ganczarz for information about how to negotiate the class time conflict.
7. You may be attempting to register for a class that is coded in error. (See Kate Ganczarz for assistance.) 
## I've been waitlisted. What should I do?
What you should do now or later depends on the reason:
1. The wait list is real:
2. The wait list is semi-real:
3. The wait list isn't real:
These reasons can also apply to wait lists for classes in other departments. (Contact that department for assistance.)
