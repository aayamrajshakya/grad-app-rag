## Master of Science in Information Technology — Online Programs
Technology is speeding ahead, and your organization—not to mention your résuméMaster of Science in Information Technology (MSIT)
That means you don’t need to be in Pittsburgh to learn from the best at Carnegie Mellon University. You don’t need to leave your job, or even your home. Our part-time delivery model pairs the flexibility of distance learning with the same access to world-class faculty enjoyed by our on-campus students. Teaching data-driven management strategies, technological expertise, and an interdisciplinary curriculum featuring three high-demand focus areas, we prepare you to lead digital transformation in your organization.
The student mix in our online IT master's program is a combination of high-performing, early career professionals and seasoned executives. It is typical, for example, for a software engineer and a pharmaceutical executive to work together, leading to career acceleration for both. If you are looking for a career boost with the latest skills, the brightest ideas, and the strongest networks available in an online program, then our online IT master's degree is for you.
