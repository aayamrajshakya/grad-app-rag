User-centered research. Human-centered design. 
The Policy Innovation Lab (PIL) is an intensive, applied policy course at Heinz College that prepares students to become public interest technologists who are creative, ethical, inclusive, and responsive. This is accomplished by teaching graduate students how to design and build public interest technology services with human-centered design, and by following an agile methodology. Working directly with a client from a government office or public service nonprofit, students aim to develop and deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with high-impact results.
Select PIL students may be invited to continue their work during a fellowship the following summer. 
The Public Interest Technology University Network Challenge Fund, a fiscally sponsored project of New Venture Fund has generously supported the development of open access course materials and the PIL Playbook, as well as the creation of Public Interest Tech (PIL) Fellowships at Heinz College.
##### Policy Innovation Lab Course Materials
Course materials for the Policy Innovation Lab are currently available through CUNY’s Public Interest Tech OER Commons site, the Public Interest Tech platform pitcases.org operated by Georgetown, Howard and Stanford universities, and Canvas Commons. We intend for these free resources to make it easier for universities to adopt and enhance coursework in public interest technology.
The materials include 7 weekly course modules, 12 assignment instructions and rubrics, a sample syllabus, instructor notes, and other course resources. They also include sprint planning and research plan templates, agile methodology readings and videos, and prototyping tools. These course materials were also referenced in the development of the ‘Teaching Public Service in the Digital Age’ syllabus.

##### Policy Innovation Lab Playbook
The PIL Playbook was designed and improved with student input, and includes a series of custom “plays” designed to help new students ramp up quickly to a Public Interest Technology mindset. The PIL Playbook has been an important resource for ongoing PIL courses at Heinz College, and has helped provide new students with a model for how to operate most effectively within the structure of the course and apply the relevant methodologies in their work.

Haleema Ahmad is currently pursuing a Master of Science in Public Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University and will be concluding her studies in May 2022. She worked on a cross-functional team looking at how the U.S. Department of Justice could compare public health data against drug-crime data to identify discrepancies in policing.
She was able to take key lessons learned about agile methods and project scoping from the class and apply them to her summer fellowship with the Innovation Institute for Tomorrow, a non-profit that aims to bring sustainable and equitable STEM education to all classrooms across Pennsylvania, with a focus on rural regions that have struggled to rebound from a long-standing economic recession. Haleema also worked on a supplemental program initiative to encourage young female participation in the STEM programs.
Yu-Jan is in the MIIPS Program (Master of Integrated Innovation for Products and Services), class of 2021.
She worked on a PIL Project titled "Combating Bias in Government Data/Algorithms" where she partnered with the U.S. Census Bureau's xD team to build a toolkit to help governmental agencies minimize bias in their datasets. The team participated in the early stage of the project, conducting a set of human-centered design research to discover underlying user needs. Yu-Jan worked as the tech specialist (UX designer) for this project, mainly focusing on creating stakeholder interview protocols, moderating synthesis sessions, and designing high-fidelity prototypes. She advises incoming fellows to enjoy the process of working with the team and partners. “It's gonna be a wonderful and unique learning experience at CMU!”
After beginning graduate school in Fall 2019, Priya Gupta graduated from CMU in August 2021 with an MBA and MSPPM dual degree.
She participated in the PIL Fellowship in Spring 2021, working with the U.S. Census Bureau to envision a toolkit to help federal agency workers learn about and address bias in algorithms being deployed at the federal level. Priya now works on customer support strategy at Google, helping protect customers’ privacy and security.
Advice for new PIT Fellows? “Always look for what assumptions you or your client are making. Talk with your client at the outset about the importance of identifying and questioning/validating assumptions to make sure you’re designing the right solution. Once you’re on board, test those assumptions at every step of the way (through interviews and prototyping). When you validate or disprove those assumptions, don't just present the problem. Present your client with a proposed path forward based on those insights.”
Alex is an Master of Science in Information Security Policy & Management student at Heinz College, Class of 2022.
She worked during the Spring 2021 semester with the Census Bureau’s xD team on an online tool aimed at combating data bias in federal government data science work.

RECENT Course Highlights
**The RIF Impact Framework: Language, Legibility, and Design for Government Capacity**  
  
Project: In response to the growing invisibility of workforce disruptions across the U.S. federal government, a team of Heinz College graduate students developed the RIF Impact Framework. This cybernetic tool helps public institutions document and interpret reductions in force (RIFs) through a structured data schema and reflexive, ethics-driven practice. By mapping lost job functions, program impacts, and geographic relevance alongside narrative context, the framework offers a practical yet thoughtful approach to tracking diminished government capacity.  
  
Designed for adaptability and transparency, the framework goes beyond data collection to encourage second-order observation—prompting institutions to reflect on their roles within larger systems. Rooted in public interest technology, labor theory, and systems thinking, the RIF Impact Framework supports democratic oversight, institutional memory, and long-term planning in an era of complex governance challenges.  
  
Project Team: Jaimie An, David Fuentes, Amy Kang, and Liv Schaefer
The students were named runners-up for the 2025 #NewMacy Cybernetics Prize, awarded by the Laboratory for Cybernetics, in recognition of their work.
**Finding the Needle in the Haystack: GovScan**  
Project: How can we take state plans for programs that are federally funded and state run (for example: Medicaid and child care subsidies) and make them digestible, easily searchable and actually useful to understand how 50 different states are implementing programs?
Project Team: Davis Craig, Aakash Dolas, Tyler Faris, and Eashwari Samant
Combing through countless PDF reports for hours in search of a piece of relevant information is no one’s idea of an interesting day at work. Tedious, overwhelming, soul-crushing, maybe. Engaging? Not so much.  
  
Dedicated public servants – and lots of other people – do it anyway, often, in service to some larger goal: to make the case for a new policy, to advocate for funding, or to explain a position. This team of students came up with a generative AI application that helps researchers find the information they seek in a matter of seconds, not hours.   
  
Their tool, GovScan, provides government workers the ability to locate the proverbial needle in a haystack. [Read the full story](https://www.heinz.cmu.edu/media/2024/February/finding-the-needle-in-the-haystack-cmu-students-develop-ai-tool-to-improve-the-usability-of-government-reports.php).

**Labor Trafficking: How Might We Create Safer Employment Opportunities for Immigrants/Asylum-Seekers?**  
Project: Technical interventions to help immigrants and asylum seekers avoid human trafficking
Project Team: Abdulaziz Abdulakhadov, Apoorva Shetty, Riddhima Singh, Tasneem Sultana, Jhanvi Udani
Criminals who deal in human trafficking prey on vulnerable people. Because they may not speak the language of their new country fluently and are often fleeing violence and poverty, immigrants seeking asylum are especially susceptible to exploitation. Human traffickers can lure such unsuspecting asylum-seekers through fake job postings hosted on popular employment websites.   
  
This student team worked with a researcher at Johns Hopkins University to develop a machine learning (ML) model that identifies signals indicating the risk of human trafficking through job descriptions.   
  
They created a working prototype that accomplished two key tasks. First, it scraped online hiring websites to create a database of job postings. Second, the team applied a large language model (LLM) to analyze the content, flag potential scam offerings, and store details (names, entities, locations) about such listings.  
  
This tool has the potential to help law enforcement agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are attempting to stop human trafficking. The prototype could also be used to develop a web extension that helps non-native job seekers directly by analyzing the contents of the page and then indicating whether a given job appears to be a safe and legitimate opportunity.
Project image is from the final project created by student team.
