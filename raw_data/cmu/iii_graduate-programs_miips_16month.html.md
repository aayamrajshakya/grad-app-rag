MIIPS ‘24**
##### Strategic Product Planning Intern,   
Volvo Group
This summer, I interned as a Strategic Product Planning Intern with the [Volvo Group](https://www.volvogroup.com/en/about-us.html) in Greensboro, NC.   
  
My projects included market research on the hydrogen industry, identifying business opportunities, and defining the scope for future Mack and Volvo highway products. I developed "day in the life" profiles for medium-duty trucks, analyzing their operations and challenges. My automotive background and training at the iii emphasized a customer-centric approach, focusing on understanding customer needs before problem-solving. I also analyzed truck drive cycles using telematics data and customer insights to align new models with real-world needs. Researching hydrogen's evolving market required adaptability, teaching me to navigate challenges with perseverance and flexibility.
