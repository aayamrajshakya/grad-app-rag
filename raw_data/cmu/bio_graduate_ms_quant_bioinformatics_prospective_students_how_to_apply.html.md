#  How to Apply 
## Step One (Application overview)
Before you begin, let us know if you have any questions.
To begin, create an account [here](https://apply-dc-mcs.mcs.cmu.edu/apply). 
Select "MCS Graduate Application", then "M.S. in Quantitative Biology & Bioinformatics" once your account has been set up.
You may also wish to apply separately to our [MS program in Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-biotech-pharma/prospective_students/index.html) and/or [MS program in Computational Biology](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/).
There is a $25 application fee for all applicants.
Application review begins in mid-December and applications are reviewed on a rolling basis after that. The final dates that applications are accepted are as follows:
All applicants: The priority admissions deadline is December 15th
International applications: March 18th application deadline to submit (LORs need to be submitted within 2 weeks after the application is submitted). The early deadline is to allow for us to have enough time to process visa requests.
Domestic applications (including foreign scholars who are currently F1 visa holders studying and living at a college/university in the US): April 29th application deadline to submit (LORs need to be submitted within 2 weeks after the application is submitted)
## Step Two (Transcripts)
Transcripts –   

International applicants: A WES evaluation will be required for all international transcripts.
## Step Three (Optional GRE)
Optional GRE scores – [Graduate Record Examination (GRE)](https://www.ets.org/) general test and subject test are not required, but will be reviewed if submitted with your application. Photocopies of GRE scores are also accepted, but if those are sent then you will need to provide official scores in the Spring if you are admitted. We do not accept GRE subject tests.
If you want to submit official copies with your application, please use the information below:
  * Institution code: CMU 2074
  * Department code: Biology 0203


## Step Four (English proficiency for non-native speakers)
English language scores – All non-native English-speaking applicants must submit an English proficiency score, unless the applicant has completed a university-level degree in the U.S. or in another majority native English-speaking country in the last 4 years. Recommended scores and minimum required scores are available here. Student who completed their undergraduate degree at Carnegie Mellon in the past 4 years do not need English proficiency scores. Photocopies of TOEFL/IELTS/DUOLINGO scores will be accepted for admission purposes only, and scores must be no more than two years old. However, if you are accepted to the program, it will be on a provisional basis until we receive your official English proficiency score. If admitted, please send your scores to the following codes:
  * Duolingo English Test: Select “Carnegie Mellon University – Mellon College of Science”
  * TOEFL: Institution Code: CMU 2074; Department Code: 35
  * IELTS Program Code: Select “Carnegie Mellon University, Mellon College of Science”


## Step Five (Letters of recommendation)
Letters of Recommendation – M.S. in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics
## Step Six (Statement)
Statement of Purpose – The Statement of Purpose should be a well-written, 1-2 page essay describing primary areas of interest, motives for a M.S. in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics and reasons for considering the Department of Biological Sciences.
Your statement should include:
  * your motivation to enter the field of Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics
  * any previous research experience you have (including your role in those projects), and, if applicable, any publications
  * your primary areas of interest within Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics
  * your reasons for considering the MS in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics program for graduate work


## Step Seven (Finishing up)
All materials need to be received before the application deadline.
After applying – application status page.
Contact us with any questions.
## Step Eight (Decisions)
Decision Process –The application review process begins immediately after the deadline. Acceptances will be received within 2 months after the admissions review begins.
