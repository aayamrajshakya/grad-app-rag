##  About the Program
  * CMU's tuition benefits cover current tuition charges only and cannot exceed the total tuition cost. Past semesters, fees, housing or other costs are not covered.
  * CMU's tuition benefit payment is the same regardless of other awards received (scholarships, financial aid, etc.). Outside institutions will allocate CMU's payment according to their policy, which may result in a reduction of other awards. If your child is receiving other awards, you should confirm with the outside institution how CMU's benefit payment will be applied to the student's account.


##  Employee Eligibility

##  Child Eligibility
  * Child must be accepted into and enrolled in an undergraduate (bachelor or associate) degree program, approved trade school certification program or community college before age 30. (Note: HR is not involved in the admissions process. Children of faculty and staff are not guaranteed admission into any university.)
  * Child must be naturally born to, legally adopted by, or a stepchild of the employee, or the child of the employee's domestic partner, and must meet IRS dependency exemption criteria.
  * Children attending another institution must be enrolled full-time (except for the summer term).

## [Applying for Tuition Benefits](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/benefits/tuition/apply.html)
For more information on tuition benefits for dependent children, see the [Undergraduate Tuition Benefits for Dependent Children of Faculty Members](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/human-resources/tuition-benefits-undergraduate-for-dependent-children-faculty.html) university policy.
# Pre-College Tuition Benefit
The university provides full-time faculty and staff members with a 50% tuition benefit for dependent children who enroll in the [Pre-College Summer Session](https://www.cmu.edu/pre-college/academic-programs/summer-session.html), a selection of university summer classes offered to current high school sophomores and juniors. Pre-College Summer Session classes award college credits but do not count as a term toward the eight-semester per child maximum for undergraduate tuition benefits. All other Pre-College Academic Programs listed, besides the Summer Session program, are non-credit summer academic programs and are not eligible for tuition benefits.
To request the Pre-College Summer Session Tuition Benefit, please complete the [Pre-College Tuition Benefit Request Form [pdf]](https://www.cmu.edu/hr/assets/benefits/pre-college-tuition-request.pdf) and submit it by email, or return it in person to UTDC floor 1 at 4615 Henry St.
# Benefits Coverage for Students
Children up to age 26 may be covered under your medical, prescription drug, dental, vision and dependent life insurance coverage, regardless of student status.
CMU requires its students to carry medical insurance. Your child must complete a [waiver form](http://www.cmu.edu/health-services/student-insurance/ "Student Insurance") to avoid being charged for Student Health's insurance plan if they are being covered under your insurance.
