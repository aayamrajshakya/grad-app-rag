Master of Science in Security, Technology, and International Relations—Accelerated Masters Program 
#### Master of Science in International Relations and Politics (MS IRP): 2016-2025
The Master of Science in International Relations and Politics (MS IRP), including its accelerated version (MS IRP-AMP), has been discontinued. The accelerated program was approved in 2015, with its first cohort beginning in 2016, while the traditional two-year MS IRP degree program was approved in Fall 2019 and welcomed its first cohort the following year. Enrollment into the MS IRP ceased in Fall 2024, and the program officially concluded in May 2025 with the graduation of its final students. This program, which ran from 2016 to 2025, has been succeeded by the Master of Science in Security, Technology, and International Relations (MS STAIR). The MS STAIR program builds upon the strengths of the MS IRP, and integrates equipping graduates in international relations, security studies, and political science with applied technological comprehension and skill sets necessary to navigate global relationships and cooperative policies in the context of emerging technologies.
