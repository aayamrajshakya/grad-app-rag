# Operations Research
Operations Research is the study of mathematical models and algorithms for optimal decision making. It is a core discipline of data analytics, which is the process of turning raw data into knowledge, insights, and better decisions. The Operations Research group at the Tepper School studies theory, methodology, algorithms, and applications related to the entire pipeline from data to decisions.
