# Micro/nanoengineering
We are investigating transport phenomena and microscale processes to create efficient devices and nano-manufacture materials.
## Micro/nanoengineering
* ### Devices and material manipulation
Microelectromechanical system devices and microscale processes are investigated from the design and modeling stages to the fabrication and testing stages. Researchers explore areas like nanomanufacturing, soft materials for robotics, micro-sized robots, DNA origami, and more.

* ### Transport phenomena
Our faculty analyze experimental measurements and high-fidelity modeling of the transport of charge, heat, mass, and momentum.
They are building efficient fuel cells, creating droplets of medication less than a micrometer in size, and developing better technologies for solid state lighting and solar energy conversion. They use machine learning to predict the physical phenomena pertinent to mechanical engineering.

* ### Micro/nanoengineering and the environment
Faculty investigate the characterization and modeling of small-scale phenomena that impact global systems. Microscale laboratory methods and computational modeling focus on developing and optimizing energy-related processes while monitoring the physicochemical properties of the atmosphere. Machine learning tools allow researchers to investigate efficient ways to clean and desalinate water.
