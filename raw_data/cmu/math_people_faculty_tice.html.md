#  Research 
The focus of my research is the analysis of nonlinear partial differential equations. Although I am broadly interested in the subject, my work has concentrated on those equations arising in physics, and in particular those coming from interfacial fluid mechanics and the Ginzburg-Landau model of superconductivity. In both cases my work focuses on the behavior of certain types of singularities in the physical systems that present many serious challenges in the analysis of the equations. For fluids these singularities are surfaces of discontinuity across which the fluid properties change drastically, while for superconductors they are point singularities known as vortices.
