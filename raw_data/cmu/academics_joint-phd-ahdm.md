The goal of this joint Ph.D. program is to train students in both the technology of AI and the human behavior contexts in which AI systems are used, with specific focus on decision-making. Students will be trained in the fundamentals of AI, AI-enabled decision-making, fundamentals of human decision and behavioral science, cognitive models of decision-making, and societal impact of AI technologies.
We anticipate that students will find placements in academic computer science or cognitive science departments and in nonacademic organizations that seek AI and behavioral decision science expertise.
## Program Prerequisites
Before Machine Learning Department students apply to the joint degree, they must take and pass five courses (listed below). MLD students will typically apply in May of their second year.
Required Courses
10-715: Advanced Intro to Machine Learning (fall semester, year one)  
36-705: Intermediate Statistics (fall semester, year one)  
10-716: Advanced Machine Learning — Theory and Methods (spring, year one)
Plus Two of the Following From CMU's Social & Decision Sciences Department
88-702: Behavioral Economics (spring, year one)  
88-703: Human Judgment and Decision Making (fall, year two)  
88-718: Large Scale Social Phenomena (not offered every year)
## Dissertation Proposal
A Ph.D. thesis will be a contribution to the combination of machine learning and social and decision sciences. The proposal must be passed by 48 months in the program (generally mid-August at the end of the fourth year).
The thesis committee should be assembled by the student and their adviser, and approved by the MLD and SDS Ph.D. Program Director(s). The dissertation committee must contain at least five members, including:
  * Two co-chairs, one from MLD and one from SDS.
  * At least one external member (usually external to CMU).
  * At least one additional MLD core or affiliated faculty member.
  * At least one additional SDS regular faculty member.


The proposal must be passed at least six months before the dissertation is defended. (This typically happens much earlier.)   
  
For questions, contact Tom Mitchell or Suzanne Muth.
## Other Requirements
  * Ph.D. students are required to be a teaching assistant (TA) twice. One TA-ship has to be within MLD and one within SDS.
  * Students must also complete speaking and writing skills requirements.
  * The Social and Decision Sciences Department also has a set of program requirements students must fulfill. You can [view those on their website](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/graduate/fields.html). For questions on these requirements, contact John Miller.


## Applying
Students interested in this joint Ph.D. degree should apply to the Ph.D. program that best aligns with their research interests. either the Ph.D. in Machine Learning or the Ph.D. in Social and Decision Sciences.
