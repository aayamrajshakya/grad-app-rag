# War and Peace in the Contemporary Middle East
## Course Number: 84-623 
This course examines the drivers of war and peace in the contemporary Middle East. It is structured around a series of key debates about different facets of conflict and violence in the region, such as the causes of rebellion, the reasons resistance groups use terrorism, and the factors that facilitate peace. We will delve into competing arguments about each of these issues, applying the ideas to cases around the region. We will also examine broader regional conflicts like the Arab-Israeli dispute and Sunni-Shia confrontation. We will use a mixture of research articles and books as well as more diverse materials such as war reporting, films, and memoirs in order to create a holistic understanding of these issues.
