## Bio
Since high school, I've been excited about quantitative finance for its unique mix of deep mathematics, data-driven thinking, and constant challenge. My passion for mathematics led me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics for Economics and Finance. My goal during my undergraduate studies was to build a wide foundational base by taking courses in math, data science, and finance. I particularly enjoyed probability courses such as Stochastic Calculus, which helped me to understand the theoretical underpinnings of options pricing. 
I applied this knowledge in a project I did with a quantitative finance club, Cardinal Trading Group. The project focused on identifying overpriced options with a high implied volatility and then selling them. I learned about using volatility models like GARCH in Python and backtesting trading strategies. 
I joined CMU's MSCF program to dive deeper into the financial applications of math/data science and to gain relevant experience. After graduation, I'm aiming for a career in quantitative research.
