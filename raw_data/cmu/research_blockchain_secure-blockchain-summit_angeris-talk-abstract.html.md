Talk title
Open problems in decentralized finance
Abstract
This talk will attempt to provide a high level overview of some known results and open problems in DeFi, with an eye towards "hard" problems that so far have remained underexplored and would be of both practical and theoretical interest.
Bio
Guillermo Angeris is the chief scientist at Bain Capital Crypto, focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi), succinct proofs, and problems within the crypto (as in blockchains) space more broadly. He was a Stanford lifer (BS’18, MS’19, and PhD’22 in electrical engineering) whose MS and PhD work spanned optimization, photonics, robotics, and statistics. His research includes the original formalizations of—and many major results in—decentralized markets as constant function market makers (CFMMs), the first computational bounds applied to nonconvex problems in photonics, and the formalization of dynamic fee markets for blockchains as optimization problems. His interests span a number of areas from succinct proofs to optimization theory, applied to a variety of practical fields.
