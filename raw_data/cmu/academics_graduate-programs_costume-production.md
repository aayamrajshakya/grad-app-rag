# Costume Production
## Create Your Future.
CMU’s costume production program allows students to cultivate their artistry and skills with one-on-one mentorship from faculty who are experts in their field, and professionals in the industry. Students are welcomed into a third-floor studio space with panoramic views and state-of-the-art equipment including dedicated and fully stocked dye facilities, multi-purpose craft space, 10-thread computer embroidery machine, patcher, complementing a full array of industrial, domestic and overlock sewing machines and irons, and additional access to CAD software, micro-processing equipment, 3D printers and laser cutters. We have an impressive costume stock that includes a historic collection that is fully staffed and well-maintained. With connections to a strong alumni and professional network, graduates are well-positioned to enter the field.
### Costume Production Curriculum
Our robust curriculum features intensive costume craft-focused classes and thorough studies in pattern development through draping, drafting and digital methodologies. This work is synthesized and enriched in tailoring and period womenswear. Students gain hands-on experience by collaborating with design peers during the school’s dynamic production season, exploring various genres. The program boasts two full-time faculty members dedicated exclusively to Costume Production, and benefits from the support of a large studio staff that engages with both Costume Design and Production Programs. Additionally, professional guest workshops provide students with valuable insights and skills beyond the core curriculum, expanding their professional opportunities.
