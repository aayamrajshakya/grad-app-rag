## Bio
Peter is a behavioral economist. Prior to joining CMU, he was an assistant professor at the University of Munich (LMU). He received his Ph.D. from the Toulouse School of Economics and completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Cape Town. 
Much of Peter's research is concerned with why people so frequently hold biased beliefs about themselves and the world around them. He is also interested in how biased beliefs shape outcomes in markets and affect how we communicate. His research uses both laboratory and field experiments.
