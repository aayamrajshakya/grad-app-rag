## Bio
Irene Xu graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2024 with a Bachelor of Computing and Financial Management. Her dual specialization in computer science and finance provided a strong foundation in financial management, mathematics, and software development. Her analytical rigor and technical prowess drew her to quantitative finance - a field where her strengths are not only applied but maximized. During her early data analyst internships, Irene built a strong base in working with large-scale datasets. At CI Financial, she expanded her technical skills through managing SQL databases, designing data infrastructure to automate recurring reports, and developing custom Python libraries. As a trusted partner to investment teams, she created user-friendly data visualizations and effectively communicated risk metrics, turning numbers into actionable insights. At MSCF, Irene is aspiring to elevate her knowledge in quantitative disciplines, statistical methods, and micro- and macroeconomics. Upon graduation, she plans to pursue a career in quantitative trading, asset management, or strats/modelling.
