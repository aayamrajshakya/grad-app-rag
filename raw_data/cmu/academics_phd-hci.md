# Ph.D. in HCI
CMU’s Ph.D. program in human-computer interaction is rigorous, creative, and deeply interdisciplinary
The small and select group of students that we admit each year study with both the founders of the field of HCI and the newest generation of top scholars. Learn more about our program.
Our doctoral students engage in research from the moment they arrive, and take courses from across the computer sciences, the behavioral sciences, and the field of design.
The HCII doctoral program offers an inspiring, collaborative, and supportive atmosphere for graduate study. Ph.D. students with a range of backgrounds and interests are challenged with tracks allowing for specialization. HCII graduates have become the face of HCI across the world, pushing the boundaries of the kinds of problems that HCI addresses, and inventing the tools and methods used to address those problems. Our graduates carry out this mission through faculty positions in the top-ranked academic departments and positions in the major industry research laboratories.
