## Bio
Having started coding at 13 years old, Caroline is proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java. She graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2025, where she earned a double major in computer science and finance and a minor in statistics while also completing several internships. Caroline is confident that her combination of skills, which she will continue to enhance at MSCF, along with her internship experiences, makes her a standout candidate for any quantitative finance role. In her free time, Caroline likes to run and hopes to complete a half-marathon someday. Caroline is excited about quantitative trading and research roles.
