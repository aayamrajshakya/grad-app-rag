# BESA Program
The Bachelor of Engineering Studies and Arts (BESA)intercollege degree 
The BESA curriculum has three main components: general education requirements, fine arts concentration requirements and engineering studies concentration requirements. Each student's course of study is structured so they can complete this rigorous program in four years.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the primary advisors and liaisons between CFA and ENG. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and an advisor in ENG to guide their focus in engineering studies.
