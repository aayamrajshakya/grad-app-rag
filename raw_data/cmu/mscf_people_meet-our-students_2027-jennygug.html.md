Bio
Jenny (Yining) Guo graduated from Emory University with a joint major in Economics and Computer Science. She thrives at the intersection of global markets, structured thinking, and data-driven problem solving. Prior to joining the MSCF program, she interned as a Summer Analyst in Sales & Trading at an investment bank, rotating through Emerging Market Credit Trading, Rates Structuring, and the Equity Derivatives Group. These rotations provided her with a well-rounded understanding of market dynamics across asset classes. She researched a credit relative value strategy, analyzed macro-driven call spread structures, and automated rates market update workflows, developing strong skills in trade idea generation, payoff modeling, and structuring logic. In a subsequent role at a leading asset management firm, Jenny conducted quantitative analysis on ETFs, focusing on performance benchmarking, factor exposures, and client risk profiling. She also contributed to sales enablement by translating complex analytics into actionable insights for institutional clients.
At MSCF, Jenny aims to further strengthen her quantitative expertise. Upon graduation, she aspires to pursue a career in quantitative trading, modeling, or portfolio management, where she can apply her technical toolkit and global perspective to generate value and drive market impact.
