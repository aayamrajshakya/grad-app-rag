## Soft and bioactive materials
What would it take to 3D print a heart? How can we control the behavior of cells using synthetic materials? Can we use inspiration from nature to design new materials for biocompatible batteries, surgical adhesives, and sustainable plastics? These are the questions being addressed by our researchers as they work to improve many broad segments of healthcare and industry.
Our researchers in this area are focused on:
  * Tissue engineering and bio fabrication
  * Bioelectronics and biosensors
  * Flexible and wearable electronics
  * Medical devices and drug delivery
  * Polymer and polymer-based hybrid materials
  * Polymer composite
  * Colloidal and functional nanomaterials
  * Soft robotics
  * Self-healing materials
