## Graduate Admissions
When is the deadline to apply for graduate studies? 
Please check our [graduate admissions page](https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/education/graduate-programs/graduate-application.html) for important dates and deadlines. 
  

Should I apply/What are my chances of being admitted?
While we are not equipped to provide informal evaluation of credentials for potential applicants, the most competitive applicants will have strong grades in undergraduate coursework (particularly in engineering and math courses), three good letters of recommendation (at least two from the most recent educational institution attended), some undergraduate research experience (for Ph.D. applicants), and for non-native English speakers, strong TOEFL/IELTS/Duolingo scores.
