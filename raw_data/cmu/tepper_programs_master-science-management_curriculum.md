## A Data Informed, Human Driven Approach to Business
The Intelligent Future℠ needs intelligent leaders. What better place to become one than Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business, the birthplace of the data-informed, human driven approach to decision-making?
Our curriculum reflects our analytical approach to business and provides students with exposure to emerging technologies. Here, you’ll be challenged with practical applications of your studies through project-based work.
> Since every industry is tied to business, I see “business” as my gateway to exploring any field. Through my entrepreneurial and internship experiences, I realized the need to strengthen my quantitative analytical skills, which led me to join the Tepper School. I’m interested in the technology industry, and Carnegie Mellon is globally renowned for its expertise in computer science. Carnegie Mellon fosters creativity and Tepper School students often collaborate with School of Computer Science peers to establish tech startups.
