## Bio
My current projects both stem from my dissertation, Hidden Waters: Groundwater Histories of Iran and the Mediterranean. The first is a multi-author edited translation and commentary on al-Karaji’s 11th-century Arabic text, Treatise on the Extraction of Hidden Waters. The second project is a revision of the dissertation and its arguments, focusing on the perception of expert cultures of groundwater management, and implications for international development projects that focus on water and development. See a synopsis of the dissertation on the [Dissertation Reviews](http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/4226) website.
