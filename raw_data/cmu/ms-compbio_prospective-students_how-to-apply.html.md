[M.S. in Computational Biology](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/index.html) › [ Prospective Students ](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/prospective-students/index.html) › How to Apply 
#  How to Apply 
## Step One: Application overview
[Applications are live on September 3](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions#instructions) and the early dealine is November 19th at 3:00 pm US/EST, the final deadline to apply is December 10 (3:00 p.m. EST[FAQ page](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-compbio/prospective-students/faq.html) for more information about the deadline and application fees. You may simultaneously apply to other programs in the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/masters-programs), including related [Ph.D. program in Computational Biology](http://www.cbd.cmu.edu/education/phd-in-computational-biology/) and [M.S. Program in Automated Science](http://msas.cbd.cmu.edu/).
Full details on applications to both of the above programs are [here](https://scsdean.cs.cmu.edu/admissions/index.html). See also: [Information regarding an application fee waiver](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/fee-waiver).
You may also wish to apply separately to our [MS program in Biotechnology & Pharmaceutical Engineering](https://www.cmu.edu/ms-biotech-pharma/prospective_students/index.html) and/or [MS program in Quantitative Biology and Bioinformatics](https://www.cmu.edu/bio/graduate/ms_quant_bioinformatics/index.html).
Please note that applications are managed by the School of Computer Science in order to allow simultaneous application to other programs listed above, but the academic home of the program is Mellon College of Science because it is a shared program so some functions (academics) are primarily under the Department of Biological Sciences.
## Step Two: Transcripts
Transcripts – For all applicants: the MS in Comp Bio program prefers unofficial copies of transcripts for application purposes, we will collect official transcripts from you if you are admitted and decide to come (required before you can start). Please note: If you are applying to multiple programs with the same application, other programs may require official transcripts in the application, please check with those program.  

If you want to submit official copies with your application, please follow the instructions for School of Computer Science. However, you should also be aware that if you are admitted, a second copy of official transcripts will be required over the summer. We verify all students completion of degree over the summer. To send official transcripts which show completion of your degree, please use the information below. NOTE: this information is different from other programs in School of Computer Science because our program is a joint program with a primary academic home in the Department of Biological Sciences in the Mellon College of Sciences and is shared with School of Computer Science. To save you time, we recommend that you wait until summer to submit these official transcripts, and only do so if you are admitted and plan to come in the Fall.
  * Institution code: CMU 2074
  * Department code: Biology 0203


International applicants: The admissions committee will not review an application without transcripts in English. If your school will not provide English transcripts, then a WES evaluation will be required; however, if the transcripts from your school are available in English, third-party (e.g. WES) evaluations are NOT necessary for application.
## Step Three: Test scores
Optional GRE -**not accepted**. Please note: most other programs that use [School of Computer Science admissions have stricter GRE requirements](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/application_instructions) than we do, specifically GRE are required by other programs even for students who have studied in the US. Our program's academic home is not School of Computer Science, thus we do have different requirements (GRE optional). If you are applying to other programs through the same application, please review [their requirements](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/application_instructions).
Language Score Reports
If you will be studying on an F-1 or J-1 visa, and English is not a native language for you (native language… meaning spoken at home and from birth), an official copy of an English proficiency score report is required (no older than two years). The English proficiency requirement cannot be waived for any reason. We strongly encourage applicants to take either the TOEFL or IELTS exam, but you may take the Duolingo English proficiency test if you are unable to test for TOEFL or IELTS.
If you are currently working on or have received a bachelor's and/or master's degree in the U.S. and your native language is not English, then you may submit an expired test score up to five years old.
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) - 
  * TOEFL Institution Code: 4256
  * TOEFL Department Code: 78

## Step Four: Statement of purpose
Your statement of purpose should be a well-written 1-2 page essay describing:
  * your motivation to enter the field of Computational Biology
  * any previous research experience you have (including your role in those projects), and, if applicable, any publications
  * your primary areas of interest within Computational Biology
  * your reasons for considering the MSCB program for graduate work


## Step Five: Letters of recommendation
The three letters of recommendation should be written by professional or academic references. Letters will be requested and submitted electronically within the online application system. Recommenders should know you relatively well and be able to evaluate the quality of your previous work. At least two should be from faculty or recent employers.
## Step Six: Application submission and questions
Application checklist:
