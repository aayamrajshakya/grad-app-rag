Banking on Blockchain: Regulatory Clarity and Commercial Bank Participation in Stablecoin Markets
Abstract
The stablecoin market is currently dominated by a small number of issuers who control the vast majority of market share. This concentration reflects the first-mover advantages and network effects that have shaped the early development of the sector. This paper explores how regulatory changes in the United States that allow traditional financial institutions to enter the stablecoin market will influence the competitive landscape. Rather than competing directly for crypto-native users, banks are expected to adopt stablecoins as digital instruments similar to checks, integrating them into services for their existing customer base. To fully meet the needs of traditional finance, a robust clearing mechanism for stablecoins will be essential.
