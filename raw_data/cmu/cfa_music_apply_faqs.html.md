# General Questions
## How should I make my video?
Students may have pre-screen recordings completed in one take or separate videos for each piece, depending on the studio area. Please review your studio’s pre-screen instructions for confirmation on video formatting. 
All recordings should be uploaded to your CMU School of Music [Acceptd application](https://app.getacceptd.com/cmumusic?org=-1.5.488377).
## When will I know my admission decision?
Undergraduate applicants: late-March.
Undergraduates will receive an official admissions decision letter from [CMU’s Office of Undergraduate Admission](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission). The final decision is available online through the [“Where Am I in the Process?”](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission/where-am-i-in-the-process) portal. Financial aid packages will be posted up to three business days after admissions decisions are processed.
Graduate/AMSC applicants: mid-March.
Graduate/AMSC applicants will receive an official admissions decision letter via the [Acceptd application](https://app.getacceptd.com/cmumusic?org=-1.5.488377). Your admission letter will also include any fellowship and/or assistantship offers. Federal loans are processed after a graduate student enrolls at Carnegie Mellon, typically in the summer. Information about graduate aid can be found [here](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html).
## Am I able to audition on two instruments or for two programs?
You can, but we typically see the most successful auditions from students who audition on what they consider to be their primary instrument. 
Choosing to audition, submit a portfolio, or interview for two programs within the SoM will require the submission of two separate music applications via [Acceptd](https://app.getacceptd.com/cmumusic?org=-1.5.488377). Please contact the Office of Recruitment & Enrollment if you plan to apply to two programs.
## Do I need a collaborative pianist at my audition?
Please see "Notes on Accompaniment" our [Audition & Portfolio Review Dates](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/apply/audition-portfolio-review/audition-portfolio-review-dates.html) page. 
## What is the difference between a Composition major, an Electronic Music major and Music & Technology with composition focus?
You can also watch our recent webinar to learn about the differences among these programs:
## I am a composer – do I need to audition on my primary instrument?
No. Your portfolio review/interview is your audition for the Composition studio.
## What Music Education study opportunities are available?
Admitted Undergraduates are eligible for the following Music Education learning opportunities:
  * Music Education Certificate, which includes a student teaching internship and leads to K-12 teaching certification in PA schools and reciprocating states. Visit our [Music Education Certificate](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/programs/certificate-programs/music-education-certification.html) page to learn more. The certificate is available to BFA performance and composition students only. 
  * Music Education Minor, which gives our students the important foundations of music pedagogy without pursuing teaching certification. 


Admitted Graduates who have earned a bachelor's in music are eligible to apply to the [Master of Music in Music Education](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/programs/graduate-programs/grad-music-education.html).
## May I apply to enroll starting in the spring semester?
All CMU School of Music programs have a fall-start term only. 
## Can I obtain a fee waiver?
Fee waivers are processed directly with Acceptd.
All undergraduate applicants who would like to apply for a fee waiver based on financial need should follow [this Acceptd guide](https://support.getacceptd.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409918628365-How-can-I-apply-for-a-fee-waiver-for-my-application-).
Once you have gathered the appropriate documentation, you can reach out to the Acceptd Support Team.
## How does a deferral work once I have been admitted?
Admitted students can defer their enrollment for one year. During this one-year deferral, you cannot be enrolled at any other degree-granting institution. 
  * Undergraduates should follow the Office of Undergraduate Admissions’ [policy on deferrals](https://www.cmu.edu/es/deferrals-and-leaves/index.html) and contact them directly. 
  * Graduate/AMSC students must send a formal letter requesting deferral to the School of Music Office of Recruitment and Enrollment by April 15.


# Undergraduate Questions
## Where do I send my undergraduate application materials?
Undergraduate applicant transcripts and test scores should be sent directly to the [CMU Office of Undergraduate Admission](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission).
Undergraduate music application materials should be uploaded electronically via the [Acceptd music application](https://app.getacceptd.com/cmumusic?org=-1.5.488377). Read our [undergraduate application process. ](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/apply/undergraduate_admission/index.html)
## Do I need to audition for the minor?
Music minors do not require an audition. Once you are enrolled as a Carnegie Mellon student, you will first contact your major advisor. Once approved to move through with the minor, please contact School of Music Senior Academic Advisor, Kate Ganczarz (kganzcarz@andrew.cmu.edu) for next steps.
## How important are grades and test scores in the admission process for the School of Music?
The audition or portfolio review is a large factor of your admission decision, accounting for about 80% of your final admission decision. This artistic decision happens first. Students who are admitted to the School of Music are recommended for admission to the University. All final decisions will be released by the [Office of Undergraduate Admission](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission). Please review all [music admission requirements](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/apply/undergraduate_admission/index.html) and [high school course requirements](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/admission/academic-requirements-college-level-work).
The School of Music is test-optional for the current application cycle. 
## Am I able to take lessons if I am in the technology track for M&T or BXA?
Performance and Composition tracks for M&T and BXA will take four semesters of studio lessons as part of your curriculum. 
  * It is important to note that once in junior year, you can only continue taking music courses as electives, which can include an elective fee. 


Technology concentrations for M&T and BXA may take lessons through the [Extension Division for non-majors](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/programs/non-majors/non-major-registration.html), since studio lessons are not a part of the curriculum.
## Are there Study Abroad opportunities?
Yes. Music students are able to study abroad but need to work closely with their advisor if they plan to be away during the academic year. Students typically use the summer as a time to study abroad. The Study Abroad [website](https://www.cmu.edu/studyabroad/) is a great resource. The BXA program also has a [student exchange program](http://www.cmu.edu/interdisciplinary/programs/abroad.html).
## Can I submit my Common Application essay for my School of Music application?
Yes! If your Common Application essay is related to music, we would love to see it. However, if you do not feel the essay is related to your music-making, we would prefer to see an essay that discusses your passion and interests with music. 
We suggest an essay close to 650 words, but please use that number as an estimate - if you choose to use a supplemental essay or your full Common Application essay, please feel free to do so if it is music-applicable.

## Is there a university graduate application in addition to the School of Music application?
No! For graduate and AMS applicants, we only require a School of Music application. There is no general graduate application that you need to complete. 
## Do I need to take the GRE?
The School of Music is currently test-optional for GRE scores. Only students applying to the Music & Technology MS may provide GRE scores.
## What graduate assistantships are available and how do I apply for one?
The School of Music at Carnegie Mellon University offers competitive fellowships and assistantships based on merit and institutional need.
For information on funding opportunities for graduate and AMSC applicants, please visit our [Financial Aid](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/apply/financial-aid.html) webpage. 
## Why aren’t my loans packaged in my financial aid decision?
All admitted domestic graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are eligible for federal loans through [The Hub](http://www.cmu.edu/hub/). Your FAFSA is processed after you have chosen to enroll at Carnegie Mellon. The Hub takes the Cost of Attendance and subtracts scholarship or assistantship tuition remission in order to determine loan eligibility. Review the [Graduate Financial Aid Guide](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/graduate/index.html) for more information.
## Can I still apply if I do not have an undergraduate degree in music?
Yes, though a music degree is strongly preferred. Applicants who do not hold an undergraduate degree in music and do not have demonstrable prior academic work in music will undergo additional evaluation by the Admission Committee and may require special approval. Applicants without an undergraduate degree in music may require catch-up work in music theory/history in addition to program requirements and remedial classes. 
An applicant may choose to apply to our [Advanced Music Studies Certificate](https://www.cmu.edu/cfa/music/programs/certificate-programs/advanced-music-studies.html) program prior to applying to an MM degree, should they choose to refine their skills and take preparatory coursework. Courses taken in an AMSC program are not transferable to a MM degree program, but are intended to help prepare students who feel they need additional preparatory work before applying to the MM.
## Do I qualify for a graduate fee waiver?
At this time, we do not offer graduate fee waivers.
We do not currently require an enrollment deposit, so the fee waiver is the only fee you will be required to invest throughout the entire admission process.
