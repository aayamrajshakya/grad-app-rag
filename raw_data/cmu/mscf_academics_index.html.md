## An Integrated, Industry-Driven Curriculum
At MSCF, you’ll experience a curriculum built through a unique partnership among four Carnegie Mellon departments: the Tepper School of Business, the Department of Statistics and Data Science, the Department of Mathematical Sciences, and the Computer Science Department. You’ll learn at the intersection of finance, mathematics, statistics, and computer science, the core disciplines that define quantitative finance.
For more than 30 years, the MSCF curriculum has been shaped by innovation and industry needs. You’ll take courses that build on one another, combining rigorous theory with hands-on application. From day one, you’ll gain the foundation to master advanced quantitative techniques and the confidence to apply them to complex financial problems.
As you move through the program, you’ll strengthen your core skills and, in your final semesters, choose electives that let you dive deeper into areas that excite you most. By the time you graduate, you’ll be ready to step into the industry as a well-rounded professional, recognized for your technical expertise, analytical precision, and ability to contribute immediately
## Applied Learning: Bridging Theory and Practice
At MSCF, you’ll quickly discover that learning doesn’t stop at the classroom door. Our program emphasizes experiential learning that turns rigorous theory into practical skills through real-world projects, industry-sponsored competitions, internships, and collaborations with leading firms. These hands-on opportunities prepare you to navigate complex financial environments with confidence and set yourself apart in a competitive job market.
