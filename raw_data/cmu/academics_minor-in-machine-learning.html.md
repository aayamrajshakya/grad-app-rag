Machine learning and statistical methods are increasingly used in many application areas, including natural language processing, speech, vision, robotics and computational biology. The minor in machine learning allows undergraduates to learn about the core principles of the field.
## Eligibility
The Machine Learning Minor is open to undergraduate students in any major at Carnegie Mellon University outside the School of Computer Science. (SCS students should instead consider the [Machine Learning Concentration](https://ml.cmu.edu/academics/ml-concentration).) Students should apply for admission at least one semester before their expected graduation date, but are encouraged to apply as soon as they have taken the prerequisite classes for the minor. Grades from the core courses are also welcomed with the application. An admission decision will usually be made within one month.
## Requirements
### Grades
All courses for the ML minor, including prerequisites, must be passed with a C or better.
### Prerequisites
  * CS background —Introduction to Data Structures; 
  * Math background — 15-151: Mathematical Foundations for Computer Science; 21-127: Concepts of Mathematics; or 21-128: Mathematical Concepts and Proofs.
  * Probability & statistics 


### Double-Counting Restrictions
No course in the machine learning minor may be counted toward another SCS minor. Additionally, at least three courses (each being at least nine units) must be used for only the machine learning minor, not for any other major, minor or concentration. (These double-counting restrictions apply specifically to the core courses and the electives. Prerequisites may be counted toward other majors, minors and concentrations and do not count toward the three courses that must be used for only the machine learning minor.)
## Curriculum
### Core Courses — 24 units
Students must take two core courses, each being at least nine units:
  * 10-30110-315:07-280

And one of the following courses:  

  * 10-403: Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control
  * 10-405: Machine Learning With Large Datasets 
  * 10
  * 10-417: Intermediate Deep Learning 
  * 10-418: Machine Learning for Structured Data 
  * 10422:


### Electives — 27 Units
The Machine Learning Minor requires at least three elective courses of at least nine units each in machine learning. Students may select one of the following options to satisfy the electives requirement:
  * Three principal courses.
  * Two principal courses + one interdisciplinary course.
  * Two principal courses + one semester of CS Senior Honors Thesis or Senior Research.
  * One principal course + two semesters of CS Senior Honors Thesis or Senior Research


Students should note that some of these elective courses (those at the 600-level and higher) are primarily aimed at graduate students, and so should make sure that they are adequately prepared for them before enrolling.
Graduate-level cross-listings of these courses can also be used for the ML minor, if the student is adequately prepared for the more advanced version and the home department approves the student's registration.
### Principal Courses
The following principle courses are acceptable options for fulfilling the elective requirement.  

  * 10-403/10-703: Deep Reinforcement Learning and Control

Note
### CS Senior Honors Thesis
The CS Senior Honors Thesis consists of 36 units of academic credit, usually under the course number 07-599: SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis. Up to 24 units (12 units each semester) may be counted toward the ML minor. Students must consult with the Computer Science Department for information about the CS Senior Honors Thesis. Once both student and adviser agree upon a project, the student should submit a one-page research proposal to the Machine Learning Concentration Director to confirm that the project will count for the machine learning concentration.
### Senior Research
Senior research consists of two semesters of 10-500: Senior Research Project
The research must be a yearlong senior project, supervised or co-supervised by a [machine learning core faculty](https://ml.cmu.edu/people/core-faculty) or [affiliated faculty](https://ml.cmu.edu/people/affiliated-faculty) member. It is almost always conducted as two semester long projects, and must be done in senior year.
Interested students should contact the faculty they wish to advise them to discuss the research project before the semester in which research will take place. Once both student and adviser agree upon a project, the student should submit a one-page research proposal to the Machine Learning Minor Director to confirm that the project will count for the machine learning minor.
Your one-page research proposal should contain the following:
  * A working title, your name and your adviser's name.
  * The following seven sections, which you should bold in your proposal. 
    1. Abstract
    2. Motivation
    3. Contributions
    4. Related Work
    5. Expected Results
    6. Timeline
    7. Bibliography
  * Your research adviser's signature, signifying endorsement of the project and willingness to supervise and evaluate it.


The student should email the ML Minor Director a brief update (two paragraphs) on their progress at the end of the fall semester, and will present their work at the Meeting of the Minds and submit a year-end write-up to the Minor Director at the end of senior year.
Students are encouraged to reach out to the Minor Director with questions at any time.
