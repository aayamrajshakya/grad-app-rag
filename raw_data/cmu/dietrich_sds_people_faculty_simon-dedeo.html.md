Ph.D.: Astrophysics, Princeton University  
MA: Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics, Cambridge University  
AB: Astrophysics, Harvard University
He has also held post-doctoral fellowships at the Institute for Physics and Mathematics of the Universe at the University of Tokyo and at the Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics at the University of Chicago.
## Research
At the Laboratory for Social Minds we undertake empirical investigations, and build mathematical theories, of both historical and contemporary phenomena. We range from the centuries-long timescales of cultural evolution to the second-by-second emergence of social hierarchy in the non-human animals, from the editors of Wikipedia to the French Revolution to the gas stations of Indiana. We create synthetic, deep-time accounts of major transitions in political order, with the goal of the predicting and understanding our species’ future. You can learn more about his research at his [lab website](http://santafe.edu/~simon/).
