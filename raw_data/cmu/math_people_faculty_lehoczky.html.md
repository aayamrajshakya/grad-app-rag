Ph.D., Stanford University
#  Research 
My research is in the area of stochastic processes and their application in mathematical finance, computer, communication and manufacturing systems, queueing theory and stochastic control. In mathematical finance, I'm studying the problem of finding the optimal consumption and investment policies for a single agent and the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium. My research involves Brownian motion, martingales and It calculus. Other areas of my research involve the asymptotic analysis of manufacturing systems and scheduling algorithms for real-time computer systems.
