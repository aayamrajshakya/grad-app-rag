# Research
Younis' lab is studying post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, specifically intron splicing. The vast majority of human genes contain multiple introns that are removed by the spliceosome in order to connect the protein coding exons in frame. Introns are much larger than exons with vague sequence identifiers, making the task of intron splicing seems almost insurmountable, yet it is done with extreme precision in normal cells. When splicing mistakes occur, they often lead to disease. Splicing misregulation is also a hallmark of cancer cells. 
The Younis lab uses a variety of technologies to characterize splicing and its regulation in normal and disease cells, including traditional techniques such as PCR and microarrays, as well as state of the art techniques such as Next Generation Sequencing of nascent pre-mRNA (RNA-seq) and High Throughput Screening (HTS). Using such methodologies, 
The Younis lab has been recently interested in a small set of introns, named minor introns, which are removed by a specialized spliceosome. Identification of all expressed minor introns in human cervical cancer cells led to the discovery that they function as stress-induced molecular switches that control the expression of the genes that harbor them. The mechanism for switching the splicing of minor introns ON or OFF relies on a highly unstable catalytic RNA, U6atac, which is a core component of the minor spliceosome required for the splicing reaction.
# Projects
  * A computational biology approach for discovery of splicing abberations in cancer cells. 
  * An experimental (molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, etc.) approach for validation of splicing abberation in cancer cells and characterization of regulators of the spliceosome. 
  * A mix of dry and wet lab projects (a combination of the two approaches above).
