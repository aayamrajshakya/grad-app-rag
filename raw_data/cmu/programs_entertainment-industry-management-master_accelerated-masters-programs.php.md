# MEIM Accelerated Master's Programs
* * *
Done faster. Change sooner.
Students with the drive to develop as leaders and enter the job market more quickly can earn their undergraduate and MEIM degrees together in five years instead of the typical six.
An accelerated master's program (AMP) isn’t just a savings of time. It’s also a considerable savings in cost, and for undergrads coming from outside of Pittsburgh, it offers an expedited path to experience the benefits of two distinct educational and cultural environments. And for the MEIM program, that means you get out to Los Angeles one year sooner!
The Heinz College MEIM program has collaborative agreements in place with the following institutions:
Carnegie Mellon University  
3 years CMU undergraduate (any major) / 1 year integrated / 1 year at Heinz College (in Los Angeles)
Allegheny College  
3 years at Allegheny / 2 years at Heinz College (second Heinz year in Los Angeles)

###### NOTE:
Due to the rigorous format and unique academic demands of the MEIM program, with its second year in Los Angeles, interested students should begin the AMP planning process as early as possible in their undergraduate career. Students must ensure that they have satisfied all requirements for their undergraduate degree, as well as their first-year MEIM core requirements, by the end of the fourth AMP year.
For more information on Accelerated Master’s Programs, please contact the Heinz College Office of Admissions at hnzadmit@andrew.cmu.edu or by phone (412) 268-2164.
