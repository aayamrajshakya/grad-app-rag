# Research Centers at Heinz College
* * *
Heinz College has an international reputation for the quality of its research. Our interdisciplinary environment creates exciting opportunities for collaboration and produces a breadth of research work not typically found in schools of our size.
Our faculty and research centers consistently receive funding support from government agencies, foundations and corporate partners, like the National Science Foundation; the Heinz Endowments; the Mellon Foundation; the U.S. Departments of Defense, Commerce, Health and Human Services, and Housing and Urban Development; the Sloan Foundation; and the National Institute of Justice.
We host or are closely associated with these CMU research centers, projects, and initiatives:
##### AI Measurement Science & Engineering Cooperative Research Center (AIMSEC)
The CMU-NIST AI Measurement Science & Engineering Cooperative Research Center (AIMSEC)National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
[Learn more about AIMSEC](https://www.cmu.edu/aimsec/)
##### ARTS MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOLOGY LABORATORY (AMTLAB)
A research center of Carnegie Mellon University's Master of Arts Management program, theAMTLab
AMTLab provides current and future arts managers, technologists, and researchers with existing best practices and emerging technologies that allow for a direct impact on their work and their organization. Through online and offline engagement, AMTLab is a resource that leads to innovative, effective, and efficient integration of technology in the cultural and creative enterprise space.

##### Block Center for Technology and Society
The Block Center for Technology and Society at Carnegie Mellon University was established to examine the societal consequences of technological change and to create meaningful plans of action. Artificial intelligence, robotics, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing promise profound impacts across society. While many of these impacts will benefit people, there exists the possibility that many in the labor market will be displaced, and that technology may fundamentally change how people engage with and contribute to their world. 
The Block Center will focus on how emerging technologies will alter the future of work, how AI and analytics can be harnessed for social good, and how innovation in these spaces can be more inclusive and generate targeted, relevant solutions that reduce inequality and improve quality of life.

##### CyLab
Advances in computer technology often have the unfortunate consequence of introducing and/or exacerbating security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can harm everyone, from the home computer user to small businesses, large corporations or anyone else dependent on the nation's telecommunications and financial systems. To counter that threat, Carnegie Mellon University has launched a security initiative designed to protect all computer users from interference by cyber terrorists and hackers. The interdisciplinary team that makes upCyLab

##### Digital Therapeutics for Health Literacy
The Digital Therapeutics for Health Literacy project at Carnegie Mellon University explores how AI-driven digital interventions can improve the way health information is communicated and understood. By analyzing engagement with online content—such as health-related videos on YouTube—the project aims to identify and promote accurate, evidence-based resources that enhance patient understanding and decision-making. Grounded in neuroscience, behavioral science, and informatics, this research addresses the growing challenge of navigating an overwhelming digital landscape filled with inconsistent and often inaccurate health information, aiming to empower individuals with tools to make informed, evidence-based healthcare decisions.
##### Digital Transformation and INNOVATION CENTER
Originally the Risk and Regulatory Services Innovation Center, the Digital Transformation and Innovation Center, sponsored by[PwC](http://pwc.com/), has expanded its mission to examine the impacts of digital technologies across a variety of industries to develop viable, deployable solutions to global business challenges. Since its launch in 2017, the Center focused on innovation in regulatory compliance and the application of artificial intelligence to risk and compliance-related issues in the auditing, data analytics, information privacy and security sectors. Leveraging CMU’s world-class thought and research leadership with PwC’s strategic client-engagement expertise, current areas of focus include data analytics, cybersecurity and privacy, and safe cities research.

##### Digital Vaccine Project
The Digital Vaccine Project at Carnegie Mellon University develops gamified, evidence-based digital therapeutics that promote healthy behaviors and prevent lifestyle-related diseases. By combining neuroscience, behavioral science, and AI, the project creates engaging interventions—especially for children—that use neurocognitive training to shape positive habits. Through rigorous trials and data analysis, the team aims to deliver scalable, low-risk solutions that empower individuals to take charge of their well-being from an early age.

##### iLab
iLab
iLab is designed to:
  * Facilitate problem-driven inter-disciplinary research on IT management and policy problems
  * Enable innovative multi-dimensional collaborations between iLab faculty, students, and organizational partners
  * Incubate entrepreneurial culture by encouraging the creation of intellectual property by faculty and students
  * Serve as a channel to create and distribute educational and research products of the school


##### Initiative for Digital Entertainment Analytics (IDEA)
TheIDEAGrowth of the Internet and mobile devices has created new distribution opportunities in the entertainment industry as companies innovate to meet changes in consumer demand, and has given rise to new business challenges from digital piracy networks, bringing issues of copyright, intellectual property, and counterfeiting to the forefront.
