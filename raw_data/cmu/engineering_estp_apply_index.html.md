## Application Review Process
Applications and admission decisions to EST&P are managed independently from the other College of Engineering programs and departments.
The application review process begins shortly after the application deadline. All applications must be submitted through our online application system by the application deadline. Supplemental materials such as official test scores and letters of recommendations can be received after the application deadline.
## Checking the status of your application
Please sign into your [graduate application](https://gradadmissions.engineering.cmu.edu/apply/) to check the status. This site is updated when material is received and decisions are made, so please feel free to check your status frequently during peak admission season.
CMU Undergraduates
EST&P only grants MS degrees, so we do not have a formal Integrated Master's/Bachelor's (IMB) Degree option. However, we offer an expedited admission process for CMU undergraduates. We also request two letters of recommendation, but we have a simplified process for CMU faculty recommendations. Interested CMU undergraduates are encouraged to make an appointment to meet with an EST&P advisor, discuss your goals and interests, and learn the full details of the expedited application process.
