In the School of Computer Science, we believe that Ph.D. students thrive in a flexible environment that considers their background and experience, separates funding from advising, and encourages interdisciplinary exploration.
In any of the Ph.D. programs across our seven departments, you'll be matched with an advisor based primarily on mutual research interests and begin a research project on day one. All our Ph.D. students receive full financial support while in good academic standing, which helps ensure freedom to explore regardless of funding hurdles. We also believe that it's vital for advisors and students to work as peers, and the inherent flexibility of our programs means students often work with more than one faculty member and many other students during their time in SCS.
Together, our research environment and interdisciplinary mindset produce graduates who emerge into the world ready to tackle its biggest problems.
