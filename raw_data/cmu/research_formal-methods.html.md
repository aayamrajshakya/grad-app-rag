Software today comes with few, if any, security guarantees. Traditionally, software vendors become aware of vulnerabilities after an attack occurs and then issue a patch that fixes that particular attack. Carnegie Mellon University CyLab researchers are looking to change all of that by employing mathematical techniques, commonly referred to as formal methods, to mathematically prove that a system is secure and protected against cyberattacks.
