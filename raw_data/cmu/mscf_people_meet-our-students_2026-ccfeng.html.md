## Bio
I graduated from Emory with a bachelor's in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. Throughout my undergraduate career, I was an undergraduate research fellow at a computational neuroscience lab focusing on data analysis and computer vision, specifically pose estimation. Prior to joining the MSCF program, I was an intern at Apple Hong Kong working with their anti-fraud department where I helped expand their existing anti-fraud models. I have also interned at a boutique Chinese hedge fund where I worked as a Python developer in their oil trading department. I joined the MSCF program to further pursue my passion in both data analytics and the financial market.
