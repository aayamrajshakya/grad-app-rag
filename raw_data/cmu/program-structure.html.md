## MS in Engineering & Technology Innovation Management
Carnegie Mellon University’s MS in ETIM degree program shapes engineers and scientists into world-class leaders in innovation and technology management. Our multi-disciplinary professors and peers teach the specialized business skills, frameworks, and technical acuity necessary to both create and capture value from innovative technologies.  
  
In addition to the base program, we offer dual degree options, a part-time track for local professionals, and a unique new degree program that combines the ETIM curriculum with the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning.

## Meet our alums
* ### Hope Dohner ’17
“As a people analyst at Google, I work on recruiting, headcount planning, and management. Every day, I use the cross-functional communication skills I developed in the MS in ETIM program to work with my fellow analysts, program managers, and business leaders. I also lean heavily on what I learned in the ETIM product management and UI prototyping classes to build tools and reporting for the business. Because I love working with all kinds of people to solve ambiguous problems, I didn’t want my career to take a strictly technical engineering path. The MS in ETIM program aligned with my goals and enabled me to seamlessly transition the focus of my work life from being purely technical to a broader one that combines both engineering and business.”
* ### Jonathan Dyer ’19
“As the lead of the Responsible AI Technical Initiative at Northrop Grumman, I leverage skills I learned in ETIM daily. I use the presentation skills I gained in the prototyping course to lead demonstrations of our capabilities. I also use the knowledge I gained in the strategy course as I help Northrop bring architectural innovation to market, leveraging our deep customer knowledge to become a leader in the space. Also, as a Dual ETIM degree student, I had the ability to take classes in Machine Learning and data science that were integral to me taking my current position. I would not be in the position I am today if it weren't for the multi-disciplinary education I received in ETIM.”
* ### Aishwarya Ramachandran ’15
“As Technology Senior Consultant at Deloitte Consulting, I deliver solutions that drive transformation, improve productivity, and streamline business operations for our clients. I use the skills I honed through the MS in ETIM program coursework every day in my line of work, especially with the Deloitte Catalyst on the AI incubation hub. ETIM faculty sharpened my technical skillset while broadening my knowledge of new subjects. I was drawn to the MS in ETIM program because of its focus on creating practical applications for the latest technology trends. As a consultant, I use this experience to resolve client issues in efficient and innovative ways.”
* ### Pablo Santaeufemia ’15
“As CEO and Cofounder of Bridge for Billions, a for-profit social enterprise that serves as a digital ecosystem for entrepreneurship, I connect early-stage entrepreneurs to global growth opportunities. The initiation spark for this enterprise began as a part of a project for an MS in ETIM course, Design, and Impact for Humanitarian Impact, which I then carried through each subsequent project course in the ETIM program—ultimately graduating as a CEO. I came to this program as an engineer with problem-solving skills, but I wanted to learn how to put them into practice. Through the MS in ETIM program, I was able to take my three passions—international development, engineering, and social entrepreneurship, and combine them to shape my career.”
* ### Julie Deng ’21
“As a senior product manager in the Amazon Music ML & Personalization team, I work with engineering, science, and product teams across the organization to understand customer preferences and build a more engaging streaming experience by bringing personalization everywhere to everyone. I find the knowledge I gained in business strategy and entrepreneurship classes from the ETIM program particularly helpful for me to be successful in my role. The wide selection of elective courses, from negotiation and public speaking to leadership and lean startup, has also helped me gain critical skills that will help me achieve my long-term goal as an entrepreneur.”
