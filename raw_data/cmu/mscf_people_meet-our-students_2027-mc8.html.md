## Bio
Po-Tsun Chen earned a B.S. in Financial Mathematics and Data Science from the University of Michigan and is now pursuing an M.S. in Computational Finance at Carnegie Mellon University. He is drawn to quantitative finance because market data reveal what people collectively believe and how they weigh risk.
In quantitative research internships, he has analyzed level-2 market data, refined risk models, automated data pipelines, and designed allocation frameworks-turning complex datasets into sharper insights on market behavior and emerging opportunities.
Po-Tsun now seeks roles in quantitative trading or research and looks forward to connecting with like-minded professionals to explore new ideas and career opportunities.
