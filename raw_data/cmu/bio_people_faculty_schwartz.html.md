#  Research 
My group works broadly in algorithms, machine learning, and numerical methods for understanding complex systems in biology. We have worked on many topics in computational genetics, genomics, and biophysics. In the genetics direction, this has included contributions to genetic variation analysis, phylogenetics, and population genetics. In biophysics, our work has been focused on stochastic simulation, particularly of macromolecular assembly processes, and related methods in model inference. The majority of our recent work is focused on somatic evolution and its connections to cancer. This includes work on algorithms for reconstructing cellular lineages in cancers (“tumor phylogenetics”) and machine learning for predicting progression outcomes.
Particular recent areas of focus have been multiomic data integration, productively using single-cell and spatial genomics platforms, and blood based tumor genomics (“liquid biopsy”).
I am also active in computational biology education. This work is especially focused on how to set standards and define core competencies and best practice for computational education in the life sciences. Areas interest include defining the standards for education of computational biology specialists as well as identifying needs for computational training among experimental biologists, health professionals, and other members of the life sciences community.
