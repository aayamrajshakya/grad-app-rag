## Bio
I graduated magna cum laude from Vanderbilt University in May 2023 with majors in Mathematics and Economics and a minor in Business. During my undergraduate studies, I became passionate for math and excelled in challenging classes such as Stochastic Processes, Combinatorics, and Financial Mathematics. I also developed a strong background in computer science by taking multiple courses and serving as a teaching assistant in Java for three semesters. After graduation, I spent a year in real estate private equity, where I evaluated acquisition opportunities for multifamily assets and managed the financial operations for eight owned properties totaling $648 million in value. During this time, I continued to prepare for a career in quantitative finance by completing an extensive online C++ course where I learned to construct and implement mathematical models in the financial market. Outside of work and study, I enjoy going to the gym, hiking, and cooking. I look forward to continue studying the subjects I am passionate about and meeting amazing people in the MSCF program.
