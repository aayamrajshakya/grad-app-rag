# Masters' Programs
## The Department of Philosophy offers two masters' degrees.
Although the requirements of these two degrees differ, admitted students are free to choose between the masters programs. They can switch at any time.
Both the [M.A. in Philosophy](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/masters/index.html#maphil) and [M.S. in Logic, Computation and Methodology](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/masters/index.html#mslcm) programs require two years of coursework. Students are not required to write a master’s thesis, although there is an option to do so. The normal full-time graduate course load in Philosophy is a minimum of three, 12-unit courses per term. Students must pass all required courses with a grade of B or higher. In order to receive a master’s degree, students must have a cumulative QPA of 3.25 or higher.
Advanced students can sometimes complete the program in a single year (including the following summer), corresponding to the fifth year of the combined [5-year B.S./M.S. degree](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/5th-year-masters.html). Also, there is a part-time version M.S. program, designed for students, such as qualified CMU staff employees using their staff benefits, who are able to pursue graduate study with only 1 or 2 courses per term.

## [Graduate Student Timeline [pdf]](https://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/philosophy/graduate/docs/graduate-student-timeline.pdf)
## Master of Science in Logic, Computation, and Methodology
The LCM M.S. offers unique opportunities for study in areas where the department has distinguished formal research strengths—the same research areas that are open to Ph.D. candidates.
It is well suited for students who are looking to enhance their training in selected areas of formal philosophy, in order either to pursue a vocation outside of academia or to prepare for further graduate study in Analytic Philosophy, Cognitive Psychology, Computer Science, Mathematics, or Statistics. Students are expected to complete a Master’s thesis by the end of their second year, though a purely course-based option is also available for students who do not wish to continue in academia.

## Master of Art in Philosophy
The Philosophy M.A. provides exciting opportunities to pursue postgraduate studies in Philosophy for students with a degree in Philosophy who wish to continue their work in a more focused and advanced way, as well as for students with a degree in another field who wish to add a concentration in Philosophy.
Students in this program will develop an understanding of a wide variety of philosophical subfields. The flexible course of study can be tailored to a student's interests and background. Students are expected to complete a Master’s thesis by the end of their second year, though a purely course-based option is also available for students who do not wish to continue in academia.

## Financial Support
The Philosophy Department offers all admitted master’s students with demonstrated financial need a tuition fellowship of up to 50%
In addition, qualified master’s students may have the opportunity to serve as teaching assistants or graders for undergraduate courses, for a stipend rate set annually by the department. In the 2023-2024 academic year, master’s students earned a $5,000 stipend for grading one course or a $6,000 stipend for serving as a TA. Such positions are subject to availability and are not guaranteed. 
## Alumni
The department's interdisciplinary research thrust affords an unusually broad range of career possibilities. Graduates of the program have been offered positions in Philosophy, Mathematics, Psychology, Computer Science, and Statistics, as well as research positions in industry. This wide range of interesting career opportunities reflects the department's unique dedication to serious, interdisciplinary research ties.
