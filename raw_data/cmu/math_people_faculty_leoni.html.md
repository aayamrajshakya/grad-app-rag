#  Research 
My current research interests lie in calculus of variations, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory with special emphasis on applications to problems in continuum mechanics, in materials science, and in imaging. Recent areas of focus have been: variational problems involving material defects, such as dislocations; the epitaxial growth of a thin film over a crystalline substrate; phase field models for anisotropic crystalline energies; phase transitions problems; water waves.
