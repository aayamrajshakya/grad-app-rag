#  Research 
My research concerns nonlinear dynamics in partial differential equations, especially coherent structures and nonlinear waves. One focus is to explain the emergence of universal scaling behavior in models of clustering and coarsening, stability of nonlinear waves and coherent states. Recent work on self-similar structures in kinetic models of coagulation has established some remarkable rigorous connections to random shock dynamics (Burgers turbulence model), Levy-Khintchine formulae, and the classic theory of branching processes in probability theory.
Work on solitary waves has achieved proofs of linear stability for the full Euler equations of water waves without surface tension, and nonlinear asymptotic stability for a prototypical model with the same infinitely indefinite variational structure.
Another line of research concerns how to pose correct boundary conditions for the pressure in the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous, incompressible flow with no slip on the boundary. A new theory was developed proving that a particular commutator formula provides a correct and stable pressure, and new high-performing numerical schemes were proposed based on it.
Ongoing investigations involve coagulation-fragmentation models of sticky particles and animal groups, and Bose-Einstein condensation in a model equation arising in kinetic theory for Compton scattering of photons.
