## Bio
Alex Marthaler is a composer, pianist, and educator based in Pittsburgh, PA. His compositions have been praised for their “color and translucency,” and are frequently inspired by physical spaces: both natural and man-made structures and phenomena. Compositions often combine harmonic and rhythmic elements from music around the world, a result of his study of tabla (an Indian classical drum) with renowned player Samir Chatterjee and his own performances of Eastern European folk music with the University of Pittsburgh Carpathian Ensemble. Recent premieres include his piece for wind ensemble Turning in AirConcrete CathedralsEurydice
In February 2017, he collaborated with choreographer Rubén Graciani on Tethers, Capsules, and Collisions
