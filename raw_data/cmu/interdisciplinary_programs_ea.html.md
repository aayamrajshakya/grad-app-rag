# EA Additional Major
The Engineering and Arts (EA) additional major
The EA curriculum has two main components: BXA requirements and fine arts concentration requirements. Each student's course of study is structured so it can be completed alongside their primary engineering major.
Students receive extensive advising support. The academic advisors in the BXA Intercollege Degree Programs are the advisors and liaisons between CFA and Engineering. Each student has two additional academic advisors: an advisor in the admitting school of CFA to guide their focus in the arts and their primary advisor in Engineering to guide their full major in engineering.
