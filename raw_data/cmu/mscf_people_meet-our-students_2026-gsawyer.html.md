## Bio
I am a CMU MSCF candidate with a passion for quantitative trading and research. After graduating with a BS in Mathematics/Economics from UCLA in 2021, I spent the next three years at Merrill in the Venture Services Group, where I worked on the trading and markets teams. Having achieved success and developed a strong understanding of the fast-paced nature of trading and financial markets, I returned to CMU to further develop my technical abilities and apply them to finance. Additionally, I have honed significant leadership and teamwork skills as the president and team captain of the Men's Lacrosse program at UCLA, and by assisting in creating the markets team within the Venture Services Group. I am seeking a role where I can leverage my technical skill set and exceptional teamwork abilities to make an immediate impact.
