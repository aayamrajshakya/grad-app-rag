## Graduate level research
Graduate students are strongly encouraged and, in some programs, obligated to engage in research during their academic tenure. Research is conducted under the supervision of a faculty advisor and is not restricted to students in thesis programs.
Research forms the foundation of Carnegie Mellon University, and graduate students play a vital role in advancing it. Research opportunities provide students with the skills required to effectively solve problems and prepare them for careers in government, industry, and academia.

## Undergraduate level research
In the College of Engineering, more than 60% of undergraduate students take advantage of the opportunity to work alongside renowned faculty researchers on innovative projects. This involvement helps students develop technical skills in a collaborative environment, which is essential in the field of engineering. Research allows younger students to explore different areas of study and identify their interests. For upperclassmen, research can lead to more advanced graduate work. Through these experiences, the College of Engineering prepares students to become trailblazers in the world of technical endeavors.
