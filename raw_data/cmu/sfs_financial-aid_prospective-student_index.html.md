# Steps to Apply for Financial Aid
## Prospective Undergraduate Students
A Carnegie Mellon education is an investment in your future. CMU offers financial aid to admitted students based on their need. We are committed to meeting full demonstrated need, which is determined through your financial aid application and your family's resources such as income and assets. Prospective students have several options for financing their education — including grants, scholarships, loans, and Federal Work-Study. 
## Step 1: Complete the FAFSA & CSS Profile
  
Timeline:**  
**Early Decision Preferred Deadline:*  
Regular Decision Preferred Deadline:*
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required to apply for federal and institutional financial aid programs. A student may need to ask one or both parent(s) to provide information on their FAFSA form based on the student’s dependency status. [Use this tool](https://studentaid.gov/fafsa-apply/parents) to determine which parent(s) information is needed on your financial aid application.
The CSS Profile is required to apply for institutional financial aid programs. Carnegie Mellon requires students to complete both documents in order to be considered for financial aid from the university. Completing the FAFSA and CSS Profile as soon as possible after they open supports the timely delivery of financial aid offers and disbursement of aid, as it allows financial aid staff time to collect and process any supporting documentation that may be required. 
*Meeting the preferred deadline supports the timely delivery of financial aid offers. Students can still apply for financial aid after the preferred deadline.

## Step 3: Receive Financial Aid Offer
Timeline: 
If you are admitted and your financial aid application is complete, including the submission of all required documents, your financial aid offer will be determined. You'll receive an email notification that your financial aid offer is available to review in My Student Aid after viewing your admission decision in your Where Am I in the Process? portal. If your family's circumstances change, then your eligibility will be re-evaluated and you will receive notification that a revised offer is available.

## Step 4: Complete MPN & Entrance Counseling
Timeline:  
Deadline:
All first-time Federal Direct Loan borrowers who enroll at Carnegie Mellon are required to sign a Master Promissory Note (MPN) and complete an online entrance counseling session. The session provides information about borrower rights and responsibilities. CMU is notified when a student has completed entrance counseling.

## Step 5: Title IV Authorizations
Timeline:
Enrolled students who are offered and/or receive Title IV funds (federal grants or federal loans) should complete Title IV Authorizations in Student Information Online (SIO)* by selecting 'Financial Aid Permissions' under the 'Finances' tab. When the amount of Title IV funds is greater than the cost of tuition, fees, housing and dining charges, the credit balance is refunded to the borrower. By completing their authorizations, students designate whether excess funds are held as payment for future semester charges or applied to non-institutional charges. Otherwise, excess Title IV funds are refunded directly to the borrower and any student account balance remaining will be due from the student. 
*Newly admitted students who decide to enroll at CMU will be able to access SIO in mid-May.

Loan funds[loan disbursement dates](https://www.cmu.edu/sfs/financial-aid/disbursement.html#disbursement).

Carnegie Mellon students have the right to request changes to their financial aid based on Special Financial Circumstances (i.e., recent unemployment, changes to income, assets) or based on Unusual Circumstances that may qualify a student for a change in dependency status.
