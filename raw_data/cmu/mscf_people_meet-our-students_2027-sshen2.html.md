## Bio
How can the care behind 100 perfect dumplings boost trading gains? At Cornell, I ran a feast for my friends. Every filling, fold, and flame had to hit the mark at once. I now bring that same tight timing to live markets. I aim to work as a quantitative researcher at a buy-side hedge fund, leveraging machine learning and statistical techniques to build predictive models over financial datasets. I add value by fusing math with modern tools. I build LSTM-AE for anomaly detection, and craft risk views with GARCH and Prophet. Few candidates speak both pandas and people. I do. A start in Hotel Admin taught me to see the client behind each chart. Dual degrees in Stats and CS set the math base. MSCF now sharpens the edge. Let's test ideas. I am free for a quick Zoom or coffee at your convenience.
