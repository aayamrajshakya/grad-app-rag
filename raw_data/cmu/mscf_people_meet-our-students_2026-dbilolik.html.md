## Bio
I am passionate about optimization and the development of optimal models and systems. Throughout my undergraduate degree and internships, I have refined my data analysis and mathematical modeling skills. All of my internships allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of the unique data structures of each respective company, which strengthened my ability to solve complex data problems. My mathematics background, leveraged by my computational skills, has equipped me with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. These skills include an understanding of statistical inference, probability, and linear algebra, as well as proficiency in Python and R to solve model development and optimization problems effectively.
