# Scenic Design
## Build Your Future
The scenic design graduate program prepares students for careers in theater, television and film, opera, dance, and emerging forms of performance-based entertainment. Emphasis is placed on developing individual artists with active voices in collaborative creation. With a dedicated team of three hands-on scenic design faculty, all of whom maintain professional careers, students learn from and develop close working relationships with the best in the business.
### Scenic Design Curriculum
The scenic design program combines established practice and innovative advancement across all subject areas. Forward-looking in its curriculum, the program undergoes regular review to determine the most current practices in training. The school’s ambitious production season is fully student-driven, cultivating a strong sense of collaboration. Production assignments are based upon individual trajectories and goals, and give students the opportunity to work in varying scopes of realized productions, all of which encourage designers to dream big.
