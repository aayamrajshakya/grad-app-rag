Bachelor of Science in Robotics - Carnegie Mellon University [Skip to content](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/bachelor-of-science-in-robotics/#content)
# Bachelor of Science in Robotics
##  Our newest primary major 
Housed within the School of Computer Science, the Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR) emphasizes problem solving and “systems thinking” across disciplines and domains. Carnegie Mellon University announced the creation of this new primary major in the field of robotics starting in Fall 2023.
Robotic technology can make cars and airplanes safer or help people with physical limitations lead healthier, richer lives at home. Robotics can clean up damaged nuclear reactors, explore the surfaces of other planets or enable sustainable agriculture. Robots can change the world for the better.
At CMU, students will learn to use robotics to solve real-world problems while mastering core concepts of computer science including data structures and programming.
While learning how to work effectively as part of an interdisciplinary team, students will also explore the greater ethical and societal implications of robotics and build critical communication and presentation skills.

## In-Depth from Day One
Built upon a solid foundation of mathematical fundamentals permeating robotic systems known as “RoboMath
The curriculum includes courses that provide a deeper understanding of control, movement, sensors, systems engineering and cognition and reasoning.
## In the Lab: Our World-Class Facilities
In addition to our exceptional faculty, Carnegie Mellon offers robotics students an incredible array of labs and research facilities in which to learn, innovate, and explore. With more than 40 labs and groups on campus, students immerse themselves in hands-on learning and gain a deeper understanding of robotics alongside peers and leaders in the field.
To explore some of the exciting projects currently under development at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, visit our [labs page](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/research/labs-groups/).
## Exciting, Challenging Courses
It all begins with Intro to Robotics (16-311) where students are encouraged to vigorously explore major concepts. Some of the most well-known projects are the creation of individual Rube Goldberg machines and a miniaturized Urban Search and Rescue mission. Other courses, like Robot Kinematics and Dynamics (16-384), currently explore methods of controlling the Hebi robotic arm, among other topics.
