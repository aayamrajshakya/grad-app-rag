# Tuition and Financial Aid
We understand that graduate school is a significant investment both in terms of time as well as money. You’re likely wondering: Is it worth it?
Is it worth investing in safety features for your car? When buying a home, is it worth investing in a property with access to great schools? What about your career? Isn't that worth investing in? 
When considering this question, it's vital to consider the cost of tuition in the context of median salaries for our graduates.

## "The MSE prepares you so well for so many challenges, technical or managerial, both inside the software industry and out. Often you don't fully realize the impact of the MSE until many years later. But without a doubt, the return on investment for me has been off the charts."

#  MSE Financial Aid Opportunities 
## James E. Tomayko Scholarship
The James E. Tomayko Scholarship is awarded to one or more students who demonstrate academic excellence, leadership potential, strong communication skills, exceptional personal initiative, and demonstrated financial need. Prospective awardees are generally identified upon the completion of one full semester in the program, with recipients chosen by committee.
## CMU Rales Fellows Program
The MSE is proud to participate in the [CMU Rales Fellows program](https://www.cmu.edu/graduate/programs-services/grad/index.html "CMU Rales Fellows Program"), a program that aims to develop a diverse community of STEM leaders from underrepresented or underresourced backgrounds by expanding access, eliminating cost barriers and providing holistic support.
## MSE Research Fellowship
The MSE Research Fellowship is a one-year fellowship extended to an MSE student who demonstrates exceptional academic performance, significant potential as a researcher, strong leadership and communication skills, and notable motivation and initiative. It provides an opportunity for a student to gain the necessary research skills needed for graduate study at the Ph.D. level. Qualified students should make their interest known to the Program Manager by their third (summer) semester of study.
## Director’s List
It pays to work hard and apply yourself. The Director’s List recognizes the top 5-10% of the class who demonstrate academic excellence, leadership potential, strong communication skills, and exceptional personal initiative. Unlike the James E. Tomayko Scholarship, financial need is not a factor. Prospective awardees are generally identified upon the completion of one full semester in the program, with recipients chosen by committee.
