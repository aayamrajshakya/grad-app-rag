#  Research 
As a teaching professor, I mostly teach introductory mathematics courses like calculus, differential equations and concepts of mathematics. Higher level courses that I teach, or am interested in, are abstract algebra, number theory, set theory and mathematical logic in general. My main field of research is mathematical logic, in particular model theory with a focus on abstract elementary classes. I am also interested in algebraic number theory, especially when doing research with undergraduate students. Most recently I guided students in a research project extending Giuga's conjecture to rings of algebraic integers.
