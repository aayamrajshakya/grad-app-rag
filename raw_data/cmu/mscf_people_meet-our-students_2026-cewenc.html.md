## Bio
I am a first-year Master of Science in Computational Finance student at Carnegie Mellon University. With a solid foundation in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from UC San Diego, I am currently exploring summer 2025 internship opportunities in Quantitative Finance and Data Science. My academic pursuits are rigorously grounded in advanced coursework in statistical analysis, stochastic processes, and data structures, reinforcing my dedication to the fields of financial mathematics and quantitative analysis.
I am deeply committed to leveraging advanced quantitative tools to address complex financial challenges and aspire to a career in quantitative research. My expertise encompasses the use of sophisticated deep learning models such as LSTM and GRU, as well as machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, machine learning, which are pivotal for robust market data analysis and prediction. As I continue to refine these skills at Carnegie Mellon University, I am enthusiastic about contributing to and advancing the field of financial technology and quantitative finance.
