## The Science of Sound 
The Science of Sound (1 semester, offered in Fall) 
Students 11+
Music Theory helps us understand certain kinds of music, but how can understanding the basic behaviors of sound show us how all types of music work? By examining how the physical behaviors of sound are manipulated, a much wider range of music begins to make sense to the student.  
This class will cover scientific concepts, including:
  * How sound travels through matter
  * Introductory concepts of acoustics
  * How different instruments make different sounds
  * How the human body detects sound
  * How sounds affect the body via the nervous system


Students in this class will be introduced to careers in sound science and acoustics research, opening up new possibilities for their interest in music that they may not have considered before.
