## Bio
Arno Zeldenrijk graduated from Wilfrid Laurier University in 2023 with a double bachelor’s degree in business finance and financial mathematics. Prior to joining MSCF, he collaborated with Professor Mark Reesor at WLU, writing a paper that integrated distortion models into credit risk modeling. He has gained experience working at prominent companies, including Fidelity Investments, Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD), where he reviewed internal aggregator models to calculate metrics such as Net Interest Income Sensitivity (NIIS) and Economic Value of Equity (EVE). Arno actively participates in sports like volleyball, spike ball, and table tennis, allowing his competitive spirit to flourish. To unwind, he enjoys spending time at New Galma Dairy, his family's farm, which produces and sells various flavors of Gouda cheese. Arno joined the MSCF program to enhance his quantitative skills essential for anyone attempting to enter the industry. Upon graduation, he plans to pursue a career in quantitative research, portfolio management, or quantitative trading.
