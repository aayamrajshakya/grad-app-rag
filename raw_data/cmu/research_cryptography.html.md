At the heart of cryptography is creating trust. Carnegie Mellon University CyLab researchers are researching state-of-the-art techniques for establishing secure communication between two or more parties in the presence of a growing number of adversaries. Strong, robust cryptography allows us to shop online, manage personal finances, and communicate with one another without worrying about criminals stealing our information.
