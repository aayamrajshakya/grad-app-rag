# Training future leaders in bioprocessing, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical engineering
M.S. in Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering Program at Carnegie Mellon University is a joint program between the Department of Biological Sciences and the Department of Chemical Engineering. Students complete rigorous coursework across the spectrum of life sciences and engineering.
There is a growing interest in cross disciplinary studies at the graduate level as well as industrial interest in hiring students trained at master’s level in pharmaceutical and biotechnology areas. The growth in this field and its potential both for research innovation and delivery of new treatments is typified by the awarding of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frances Arnold for her work in Synthetic Biology. As such, we are poised to offer an advanced 1.5-year program for students to specialize a degree in Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Engineering by combining strengths in the departments of biological sciences and chemical engineering. Our program has connections to dozens of companies who have worked with us to build the curriculum and prepare students for internships and careers.
