## Group projecs with real-world clients
Most full-time Heinz College master’s students complete a team-based project, working in close collaboration with a real-world client. These projects fulfill an actual business or operational need for our partners, giving students an opportunity to have a measurable impact while still in school.
Recent student groups have analyzed the discrepancies between organ transplant patient care handbooks across the U.S., as well as created a resilient medical-records system for a clinic in Haiti designed to withstand storms that impact power and Internet access.

##### Policy innovation lab: User-centered research, human-centered design
At Heinz College, students learn by engaging with the real world—under the tutelage of our trail-blazing faculty. Heinz's Policy Innovation Lab provides students with an avenue to gain real-world experience as they earn their master's degree. 
The Policy Innovation Lab is an intensive, applied course that prepares students to become public-interest technologists who are creative, ethical, inclusive, and responsive. Our faculty teach students how to design and build public-interest technology services with human-centered design. Working directly with a client from a government office or public-service nonprofit, students aim to develop and deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with high-impact results.
Recent projects include the development of a large language model to ensure safe employment opportunities for immigrants and asylum seekers, the creation of an open-source green investment bonds platform for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, and the support of a toolkit that helps the U.S. Census Bureau counter bias in artificial intelligence.
