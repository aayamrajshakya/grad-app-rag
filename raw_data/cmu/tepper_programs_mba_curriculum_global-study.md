# Global Capstones
## Real-World Global Experience
The Tepper School’s Global Capstone projects give you the chance to work directly with international companies on pressing business challenges. You will travel abroad, partner with global organizations, and deliver solutions that matter. These immersive experiences combine consulting, cross-cultural collaboration, and faculty mentorship, preparing you for leadership in global markets.
## How Global Capstones Work
Global Capstones are structured consulting engagements that mirror professional practice:
  * Company-sponsored projects addressing real business needs
  * On-site immersion in international markets, cultures, and industries
  * Faculty and industry mentors guiding project scope and execution


By combining classroom knowledge with applied consulting, students learn how to approach ambiguous business problems, structure solutions, and deliver recommendations directly to executives.

These projects exemplify the hands-on, global consulting experiences that prepare Tepper School graduates to lead in complex international environments.

## Global Treks
Global Treks are student-led experiences that give you exposure to international markets outside of formal consulting engagements.
  * Organized by student clubs and leaders
  * Visits to companies and organizations
  * Cultural immersion alongside business insights
  * Networking with alumni and industry leaders


Through Global Treks, you learn how global business operates at the ground level, how culture shapes decision-making, and how to build professional connections that span borders.
