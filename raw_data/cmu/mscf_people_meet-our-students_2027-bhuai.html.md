## Bio
Chengtian "Bosco" Huai earned a BSc in Quantitative Finance from the University of Hong Kong in 2025, mastering coursework in mathematics, statistics, finance, and computer science. He thrives on turning challenging mathematical problems into elegant computational models.  
  
Bosco's first taste of quantitative finance came during a 2023 internship at CICC, where he began designing systematic strategies for China's A-share market-work he continues to refine today. He later joined Fides Capital Group, a Hong Kong-based hedge fund, deepening his experience in U.S. market strategies and risk management.  
  
Now entering the MSCF program, Bosco is eager to expand his quantitative toolkit and pursue a career in quantitative research, systematic trading, or asset management.
