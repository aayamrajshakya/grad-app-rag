## Bio
Jacob Freedman graduated magna cum laude from the University of Southern California with a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. While at USC, Jacob delved into the mathematics of a variety of subjects, such as probability and machine learning, while also laying the foundation for his programming knowledge through C++. Following graduation, he joined the Allstate Corporation, where he worked as an actuary. As an actuary, he continued to hone his analytical and programming skills. During his time there, Jacob was responsible for over $1bn in premiums, managing large sets of policyholder data in order to implement new rating plans for customers.  
  
After four years at Allstate, Jacob decided to join the MSCF program to further pursue his interest in data analytics and to expand his quantitative abilities. Upon graduation, he hopes to use these skills to pursue a career in quantitative research, trading, or financial technology.
