## Academic advisors
Our team meets regularly with students to support and assist them during their time at Carnegie Mellon.
We serve as a general guide for students from enrollment through to graduation and provide assistance with academic or personal situations that students do not have the information or resources to resolve. We assist in navigating degree requirements and graduate student policies. We verify progress toward degree requirements and share available resources for course and research challenges. Students can discuss course options based on focus area with us and we can sssist with registration issues including waitlists, research units, registrar forms, etc.
We are accessible through appointments, walk-ins, email, and phone.

## Faculty research advisors
For students in the Ph.D. program, M.S. in Mechanical Engineering - Research program, and M.S. in Computational Design and Manufacturing program, faculty research advisors will: 
  * Guide the student through the successful completion of a research project
  * Discuss courses students may take that fit the research project
  * Discuss challenges students face in their courses or in research
  * Provide advise on opportunities presented to graduate students
  * Discuss research for credit and summer research opportunities in the faculty's lab
  * Discuss general technical subjects in mechanical engineering
  * Offer general advice and mentoring.


## Faculty mentors
Faculty mentors offer advice and guidance when contacted by an academic advisor with master’s students’ questions that are outside of the advisor’s expertise.
## Career consultants 
The [Career and Professional Development Center](https://www.cmu.edu/career/index.html) will:
  * Help you to create and update your resume
  * Teach you how to search for a summer internship and full-time job
