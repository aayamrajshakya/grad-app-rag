# Communication Support
Communication Support supports students in developing effective written, verbal, and visual communication skills through interactive one-to-one consultations, workshops, and dissertation writing groups. These services are available for any CMU undergraduate or graduate student from any discipline.

Dissertation Writing Groups hold weekly or biweekly meetings designed to offer focused support for doctoral students writing their dissertations, provide a collaborative space to work with CLS Writing Consultants trained in advanced research, and connect with fellow PhD candidates across CMU.

"Not only did I get a sense of how I can write more effectively, but also gained a better understanding of how to optimize my thinking process for different writing tasks."
— Graduate student in Heinz College
"This was one of the best hours spent of my academic career. I have always been insecure about my writing skills, but while working with my tutor, I got very precise and effective feedback. My consultant had already looked at the document I uploaded, had very specific queries as we started the session, and then addressed them with very specific answers."
— Visiting Scholar, Computer Science
"I didn't expect to get much done because I didn't have a draft, but we made a lot of progress with just the outline! I have a better idea of what my paper will be now."
— Undergraduate student in Psychology and Linguistics
"This is the type of personal attention you need that can sometimes be forgotten in college."
— Undergraduate student, School of Design
