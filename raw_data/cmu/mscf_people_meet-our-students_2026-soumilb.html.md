## Bio
I love taking up challenges and pushing myself to boundaries I have never experienced. This is why I have pivoted my career into the world of quantitative finance. I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Social Sciences in Economics with a Minor in Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I got more involved with programming and took up courses in Python and R. I have always been inclined to the mathematical aspect of economics and eventually took up multiple internships in Data Analytics. Upon graduation in 2021, I joined as a Data Engineer in Rackspace Technology. I have implemented projects on multiple cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud. I was inclined to join the MSCF as I wanted to use my quantitative aptitude and programming skills in the world of finance. I want to delve deeper into mathematical models that predict stock and option prices. I aim to work in quantitative trading and apply concepts of machine learning in this domain.
