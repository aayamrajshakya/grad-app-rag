## Our facilities
[ Claire and John Bertucci Nanotechnology Lab The Claire and John Bertucci Nanotechnology Lab, located in Carnegie Mellon University’s Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall, is a premier research facility in Western Pennsylvania and the Tech-Belt region (PA-OH-WV) and is home to more than 100 processing and characterization tools.   
  
Housed within the lab is the 8,500 sq. ft. Eden Hall Foundation Cleanroom, renowned for its energy efficiency. Designed to support a continuously growing and diversified set of users, the lab features state-of-the-art controls, 19 wet chemistry decks, and 3 EMI-shielded rooms. ](https://nanofab.ece.cmu.edu/)
[ Materials Characterization Facility The Materials Characterization Facility houses 13 state-of-the-art characterization tools, supports the cutting-edge research of nearly 60 groups at Carnegie Mellon University, and enables enhanced data analysis for researchers in 30 countries around the world.  
  
At the center of the Materials Characterization Facility is the Digital Microscopy Classroom. Unlike many other characterization facilities, the classroom enables students to operate the microscopes remotely. It is also used extensively for undergraduate and graduate courses, special seminars, and instrument manufacturer tutorials. ](https://engineering.cmu.edu/mcf/index.html)
[ Tartan Research Advance Computing Environment The College of Engineering’s Shared Computing Facility (SCF) is a core research facility made available to researchers within the Tartan Research Advanced Computing Environment. In partnership with the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, CMU's Trace provides cutting-edge high-performance computing capabilities and comprehensive support, including software setup, job submission, troubleshooting, and data storage. Research groups benefit from subsidized compute capacity and increased CPU/GPU counts. The SCF stands as a crucial resource for advancing research within the college. ](https://www.cmu.edu/engineering/trace/index.html)
