# Horacio Arló-Costa Graduate Fellowship
In honor of our distinguished faculty member and dear friend, and with the support of donations from many sources following his passing in 2011, the Department of Philosophy is proud to provide the Horacio Arló-Costa Graduate Fellowship.
The Fellowship is awarded every other year to an especially promising first-year graduate student, and is intended to help increase the quality and diversity of all aspects of the graduate program. [Contributions to the Horacio Arló-Costa Memorial Fellowship Fund](https://makepossible.cmu.edu/) are welcomed; please designate the funds for "Philosophy: Arló-Costa Fellowship" in the "Other" category.
