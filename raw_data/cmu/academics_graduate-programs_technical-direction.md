### Technical Direction Curriculum
The School of Drama’s comprehensive technical curriculum is enhanced by access to Carnegie Mellon’s world-class technical, robotics, and computer science programs. Technical direction students learn within a commercial shop structure, and production experiences supplement classroom learning by introducing students to a range of collaborators, theatrical environments, and resource management.
