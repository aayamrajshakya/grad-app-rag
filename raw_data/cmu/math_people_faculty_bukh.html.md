#  Research 
I enjoy searching for the largest and best combinatorial objects. Oftentimes the search brings problems of algebraic and geometric flavour, which I especially like.
Below are some of the topics and basic problems that I have played with in the past:
  * Turán problems


  * Geometric selection theoremsRd
  * Combinatorial number theory
  * Codes
