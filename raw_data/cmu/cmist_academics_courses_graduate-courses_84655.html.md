# Democracy’s Data: Analytics and Insights into American Elections
## Course Number: 84-655 
In the aftermath of the 2024 US presidential election, understanding the intricacies of electoral processes has become paramount. This course offers a unique blend of political science and data analytics, specifically focusing on the American electoral system. It places a special emphasis on the recent 2024 election, as well as the upcoming midterm and local elections. One common observation is that people often perceive the next election as the most significant. However, history demonstrates that elections can have profound and enduring impacts. From the pivotal election of 1876, which concluded Reconstruction and reshaped the nation for a century, to the razor-thin margins in the 1960 Kennedy election and the 2000 Bush-Gore contest, American politics has been profoundly influenced by electoral outcomes.
Throughout the semester, students will actively engage in data collection, statistical analysis, and interpretation. These techniques will be applied to analyze election trends, voter demographics, and the influence of technology on political campaigns. The course will also explore how data analytics can assess the health of democracy, examining metrics such as voter turnout, electoral competitiveness, and public trust in electoral institutions.
As the course progresses, students will utilize analytical tools to make informed predictions about the 2026 midterm elections, which will determine all House seats and 35 Senate seats. Additionally, they will delve into odd-year elections in various states and localities, gaining insights into their unique dynamics and implications. This forward-thinking approach ensures that participants are well-prepared to interpret and anticipate changes in the American political landscape.
Beyond the core topics, the course will cover a diverse range of additional subjects, including political advertising, campaign finance, media bias, partisanship, nationalization, mobilization strategies, vote suppression techniques, election security, voter knowledge, racially polarized voting, gerrymandering, polarization, forecasting models, and public opinion polling.
