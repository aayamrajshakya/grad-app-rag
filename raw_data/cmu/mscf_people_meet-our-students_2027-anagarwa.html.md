## Bio
What drives someone to study both computer code and market chaos? For me, it began during my engineering studies when I realized that the most interesting problems in finance required both technical skills and market intuition. My dual degree from NMIMS University (B.Tech Computer Engineering + MBA Technology Management, top 10% of class) gave me the foundation to understand both worlds. During my year as a Research Assistant at the India Gold Policy Center, IIM Ahmedabad, I put this combination to work, co-authoring an award-winning case study on bullion banking and providing strategic advice to the Government of India on reducing gold trade deficits. This experience confirmed my passion for quantitative research, where I can utilize my business and market knowledge along with statistical and coding tools to generate returns.
My combination of technical skills in Python, statistical modeling, and data analysis, paired with market understanding from studying commodity flows across countries, positions me well for quantitative strategy roles. I understand how geopolitical events move markets because I've seen how macro shifts create both challenges and opportunities. My research background means I can dive deep into complex datasets while maintaining focus on the broader market picture. I don't just analyze data, I transform it into actionable investment strategies that adapt to changing market conditions.
I'm always up for a coffee chat, an online meeting, or even a game of squash to discuss where financial markets are heading and how we can work together to develop innovative quantitative strategies.
