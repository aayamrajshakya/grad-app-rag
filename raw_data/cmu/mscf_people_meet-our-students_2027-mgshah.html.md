## Bio
I've long believed that numbers are the key to making sense of the gray in our world. With a foundation in Computer Science and Finance, I have developed a structured approach to problem solving, grounded in analysis and optimization, and a strong understanding of markets. Through projects ranging from customer segmentation to pricing models, I've learned to think critically about data and meaningfully extract patterns that drive real business decisions. I focus on solutions that work in practice, not just theory.  
  
At MSCF, I'm deepening my expertise in statistical inference and stochastic processes to understand the mathematics behind risk, return, and uncertainty. Upon graduation, I aim to join a team where I not only evaluate and design systematic strategies but bring them to life in robust, data-driven frameworks that respond to real-world complexity, just as I've always believed numbers can do.
