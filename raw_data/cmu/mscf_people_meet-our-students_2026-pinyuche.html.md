## Bio
Having graduated from NYU with a double major in Honors Math and Data Science, I have studied and practiced derivative pricing and financial data mining, including stochastic calculus and time series analysis. During my undergraduate years, I interned as a quantitative researcher at Orient Asset Management and Ruitian Investment, two top buy-side financial companies in China. There, I applied recurrent neural networks to mine and optimize alternative factors with high Sharpe Ratio and ICIR. In 2024, I joined MSCF to further study C++ and more advanced financial theories. With a keen interest in the dynamics of financial markets, I enjoy challenging myself with steep learning curves and fast-paced working environments, and I intend to intern and work as a quantitative trader or researcher.
