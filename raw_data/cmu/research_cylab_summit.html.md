## About
Digital public goods (DPGs) are an important tool for helping to realize the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The Digital Public Goods Alliance (DPGA) defines digital public goods as “open-source software, open data, open AI models, open standards, and open content that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm by design, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals.” As of July 2022, there are 116 digital solutions that have been evaluated against the DPGA standards and have been classified as DPGs. There are an additional 103 solutions that have been nominated as DPGs. These solutions span the entire spectrum of SDGs and are expected to play a major role in the digital transformation of low and medium-income countries.
However, despite the promise and significance of DPGs, there is little global coordination or consensus about how to design the technical building blocks of digital public goods and how they should interact with each other. With different projects addressing different problems and being developed independently, there is no guarantee that they will integrate well together in a cohesive ecosystem, or that they will satisfy basic quality standards. This lack of systematic oversight and coordination can substantially undermine the global value of DPGs, particularly in terms of their security, privacy, and fairness.
The CyLab-Africa Summit on Digital Public Goods will bring together stakeholders from across Africa, including government regulatory authorities, national central banks, telecommunications providers, healthcare providers, financial services companies, NGOs, and academia. The summit will explore how technology in general, and DPGs in particular, can be used to accelerate digital transformation securely, privately, and equitably. This summit will be held at the CMU-Africa campus in Kigali, Rwanda from October 10-11, 2022.
