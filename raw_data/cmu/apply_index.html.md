##  [LTI PhD/MLT Graduate Application Support Program](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/academics/phd/application-support)  

Historically, pre-college students have not had access to guidance from people familiar with the graduate application process. This initiative aims to help applicants improve their content by connecting them with students in the School of Computer Science (SCS) to provide feedback on their application materials. 
When you apply to an SCS doctoral program, you can also apply to work with a student mentor to receive input on your Statement of Purpose and general information about applying to doctoral programs. This support program is an unofficial resource independent of the SCS graduate application.
Application mentoring for the 2024-25 admissions cycle has closed and will reopen in fall 2025.
You can learn more about the application process on our[Graduate Admissions](https://cs.cmu.edu/academics/graduate-admissions) page.
