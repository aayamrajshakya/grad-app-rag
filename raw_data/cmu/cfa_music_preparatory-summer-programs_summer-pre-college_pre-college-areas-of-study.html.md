# Areas of Study
Students in the Pre-College Music Program choose to major in one of four areas.
In addition to these majors, CMU Pre-College Music offers courses in jazz studies open to any student.
## Instrumental Performance
Instrumental Performance Majors
Instrumental majors receive a one-hour private studio lesson each week and participate in seminars to explore concepts and techniques of performance, discussing topics relevant to their concentration.
All students perform on the concert stage throughout the summer in faculty-coached chamber music groups, the Millennium Symphony Orchestra, the Wind Ensemble, Jazz Ensemble, and others.
## Vocal Performance
Vocal Performance Majors
Voice majors receive a one-hour private studio lesson (with professional accompanist) and an additional half-hour private vocal coaching session each week through the summer, where they work on classical vocal technique.
Voice majors perform on the concert stage throughout the summer in the Concert Choir, vocal recital, and in voice masterclasses. They combine the skills gained from dance class, acting class, and private instruction in the performance of semi-staged opera scenes.
## Composition
Composition Majors
All composition majors meet in Composers Forum to hear lectures, participate in discussion, and present student works or works-in-progress. At the end of the summer, students participate in a recording session with professional musicians who will read student works.
Composition majors may audition for any summer instrumental ensemble to develop collaborative playing. Ensembles include the Millennium Symphony Orchestra, the Wind Ensemble, the Jazz Ensemble, and others.
## Music Technology / Electronic Music
Music Technology / Electronic Music Majors
Along with private studio lessons, these students work in a fully-equipped studio, recording live musicians. In these sessions, they are taught proper recording practices such as microphone selection/placement, advanced microphone techniques, and studio management. They learn the basics of Pro Tools as well as how to use industry-standard plugins necessary for post-production. 
Music Tech / EM majors meet in the weekly Music Tech Forum to hear lectures, participate in discussion, and present student works or works-in-progress. They also take Recording Techniques and Music Technology Lab courses, in which students study the properties of sound and learn the basics of digital audio, MIDI, sequencing, and multimedia by using several different computer programs. Basic and advanced concepts of notation software will also be covered.
Music Tech / EM majors may audition for any summer instrumental ensemble to develop collaborative playing. Ensembles include the Millennium Symphony Orchestra, the Wind Ensemble, the Jazz Ensemble, and others.
## Elective Jazz Studies
Students interested in jazz studies are encouraged to participate in the many Pre-College jazz opportunities, including:
##### Jazz Ensemble
Students in the jazz program participate in the Jazz Ensemble, lead by Grammy-award-winning saxophonist Eric DeFade. The ensemble focuses on jazz standards in a variety of styles and performs several times during the program.
##### Jazz Clinic/Combos
Mr. DeFade coaches student jazz combos and leads a course in jazz improvisation. Weekly clinics include a mixture of master classes, literature/repertoire discussion, and instrument-specific ensemble playing.
##### Jazz Choir
The Jazz Choir explores jazz vocal techniques and styles, and performs with the Jazz Ensemble during the program.​
