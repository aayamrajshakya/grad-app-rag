## Bio
Hansen (Zhenhan) Gan earned his Bachelor of Science degree with honors from Johns Hopkins University in 2024, triple-majoring in Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics. During his undergraduate studies, Hansen conducted research with Prof. Steve Hanke and applied his sentiment analysis insights using machine learning on the gold market. He led a team of students and connected with industry developers to live trade spot gold algorithmically. Before joining MSCF, he interned as a quant researcher at Huatai-Pinebridge Investments, where he helped fine-tune large language models for stock selection. He also gained experience as a sales and trading summer analyst at China International Capital Corporation in their fixed-income division, working on price-volume indicators for Chinese convertible bonds. Hansen joined the MSCF program to expand his network and leverage his skills to pursue a future career in quantitative trading and research.
