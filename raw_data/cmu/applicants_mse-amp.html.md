The IS-MSE Accelerated Master's Program (AMP) is a 5th year master's program for undergraduate Information Systems majors offered jointly by the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences and the Heinz College of Information Systems and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon. The AMP gives you a head start in earning a master’s degree while still enrolled as an undergraduate student. As a student in the AMP, you will receive your master’s degree three semesters after receiving your bachelor’s degree. Compare that to a traditional plan where a bachelor's degree takes four years, plus one and half to two years to earn a master’s degree. With the IS-MSE-AMP, you save both time and money, launching your career, ahead, above, and beyond.
