# Measuring & Managing AI Risk
Advancing the Science of AI Evaluation
# The AI Evaluation Imperative
Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have the potential to create wide-ranging benefits
Despite the extraordinary pace of innovation now underway, modern AI systems that build on Machine Learning (ML) and Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit weaknesses and vulnerabilitiessusceptible to misdirection  
  
Addressing these challenges requires innovations in the design, evaluation, testing, and monitoring of AI systemscollaborative research and experimentation
The work of AIMSEC is intended to develop and advance our national capability to develop and deploy trustworthy AI systemsreliableresilienttrustworthy
# What Is AIMSEC?
AIMSEC is a research hub based at Carnegie Mellon University
The cooperative center is designed to enable engagement between [National Institute of Standards and Technology](https://www.nist.gov/) (NIST) researchers, CMU researcherspartnersgovernment and industryharness the research ecosystem

#  Our Goals 
1. Advance modern AI risk management.  

Our goal is to advance the state of the art in the science of evaluating and mitigating the risks associated with the development, deployment, and evolution of AI-based systems for diverse applications.
2. Validate evaluation approaches through stakeholder partnerships.
We aim to convene the necessary stakeholders from academia, industry, and the public sector to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the development of AI risk management practices.
3. Translate assessment capabilities and methodologies to practice.
We are cultivating a research ecosystem that connects stakeholders and catalyzes a rich collaboration between NIST and CMU. In doing so, we hope to support a more rapid translation of emerging risk management capabilities into state of the practice, through the building of methodologies, software toolkits, and trainings, with ultimate benefit to the broader evaluation and deployment of trusted AI systems.
