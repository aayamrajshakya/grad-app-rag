EXP 
###  EXP
EXP is Northeastern University’s new eight-story, 357,000-square-foot facility that will further the horizons of science, engineering, teaching, and creating. Opened in fall 2023, it offers eight floors of occupiable space, including a top-floor executive area; a floor primarily dedicated to computational research, or research that uses computing systems to apply mathematical models for solving problems; four floors of teaching and academic research labs; 15,000 square feet of makerspace throughout the building; a cafe and “Ideation” space overlooking a ground-floor robotics area, and much more. The following College of Engineering-led research institutes and centers are located in EXP, including the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, Institute for Experiential Robotics, and Institute for NanoSystems Innovation.
