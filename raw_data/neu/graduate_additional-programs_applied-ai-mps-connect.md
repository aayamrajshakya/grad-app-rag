2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Professional Studies in Applied AI—Connect program is designed for students without prior experience in engineering, computer technology, or statistics. The program requires an additional 9 semester hours of coursework that provide the intensive, hands-on instruction necessary for students considering a career change to artificial intelligence, connecting the student's current background to artificial intelligence applications.
For the 2025–2026 academic year, the MPS Applied AI—Connect program is being offered as a collaboration between the College of Professional Studies and the Office of the Provost. During this period, students will follow Northeastern University’s Graduate Academic Calendar and be governed by the academic policies and procedures documented in the university’s [Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/ "https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/").
During the time a student is designated under the Office of the Provost, the College of Professional Studies will provide each student with full academic and student support services (e.g., academic advising services, co-op and career advising services, International Tutoring Center, etc.).
Beginning in the 2026–2027 academic year, students enrolled in the MPS Applied AI—Connect program will transition to the College of Professional Studies, and their official college designation will be updated accordingly in the academic system of record. At that time, students will be governed by the academic policies and procedures documented in the university’s [Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/professional-studies/ "https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/professional-studies/"), specifically relating to the College of Professional Studies.
