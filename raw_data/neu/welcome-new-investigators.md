## Research at Northeastern
Welcome to Northeastern University! We are pleased that you have chosen to conduct your research here, and NU-RES is ready to assist with the transition of any ongoing research.
As soon as you know that you will be transferring to Northeastern, we recommend that you start talking with all of the parties involved with your award:
### [Contact your Grant Officer by selecting your organizational unit or searching for your name](https://res.research.northeastern.edu/research-and-sponsored-programs-points-of-contact/)
Your Grant Officer will guide you through the process of transferring your grant to Northeastern.
### Talk to your Current Institution
Obtain approval from your current institution to relinquish the award(s) you intend to transfer. Awards are made to institutions and not to individual researchers.
Departmental Research Administration at your current institution needs to know that you will be transferring to NU and what the transfer date will be. Provide contact information to all Research Administrative Personnel at both institutions so they can start discussing the transfer.
### Talk to the Funding Agency
Inform them of the pending transfer and see if there are any special issues that might delay or prohibit the transfer.
### Notify All Co-PI’s and sub-awardees
All should be notified of the pending award transfer. Consider other personnel on the award. Will they continue to work on the project? Then a sub-award may be issued back to the current institution once the award is transferred so they can continue to work on the process.
