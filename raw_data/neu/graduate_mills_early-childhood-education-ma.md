2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
This program is designed to prepare our students to work as leaders in teaching or administration in early childhood settings, including preschools and child development programs. In addition, the program prepares students to teach early childhood education topics in community colleges or adult education programs. Our students often continue their education to pursue research or doctoral degrees, as well as other forms of professional leadership. The program provides a strong foundation in child development and in developmentally, culturally, and linguistically responsive practices. The full-time MA programs can be pursued alongside the following teaching credentials: early childhood special education, multiplesubject (for K–8 teaching), oreducational leadership.
## Special Education Credential 
In combination with the early childhood education MA, this program prepares students to work in early intervention and preschool special education settings with infants and young children who have developmental disabilities. Graduates see that working with families, caregivers, and communities is integral to the education and care of young children with special needs.(See program details for specificinformation on the multiple subject and administrative services credentials.)
###  Coursework
A total of 42 semester hours are required to earn the Master of Arts in Early Childhood Education with coursework leading to eligibility for the Special Education Credential. Coursework integrates theory and practice to prepare students to teach in urban settings and is guided by an overarching concern for social justice. All courses listed below, along with state-mandated fieldwork and assessments, fulfill the requirements to meet eligibility for the Preliminary Education Specialist, Early Childhood Special Education Credential, in the state of California. The final authority to grant a credential lies with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
### Fieldwork 
The early childhood education department maintains the belief that coursework and fieldwork must be integrated. Therefore, courses have assignments requiring engagement in educational settings, and students are placed in experiential learning/educational fieldwork every semester of the two-year program. During a student's first year, they are placed at the Mills College Children's School, where they are closely mentored by experienced and knowledgeable early childhood professionals. Students participate in weekly reflective circles with team members, where they discuss instructional decisions and interventions, receive feedback, and identify the next steps for supporting children and families. During the second year, student teaching occurs in an early intervention setting and a preschool/kindergarten setting. In their field placements, students have an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of effective early intervention and preschool special education. These experiential learning experiences total over 900 hours and therefore far exceed the 600 hours of fieldwork required by the state accrediting body, the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Throughout the course sequence of the ECSE program, students compile a digital portfolio, which includes course assignments such as reflection pieces, presentations, and papers. The portfolio provides evidence of varied experiences, depth of knowledge, and critical reflection around instruction gained during the program. 
Please note:(with the exception of Graduate Seminar: Research in Education 1 (EDUT 6210),Graduate Seminar: Research in Education 2 (EDUT 6211), Responsible AI (PHIL 5110),AI in Education (EDUT 6150), along with state-mandated fieldwork and assessments, fulfill the requirements to meet eligibility for the Preliminary Education Specialist, Early Childhood Special Education Credential, in the state of California. The final authority to grant a credential lies with the Commission on Teacher Credentialing.
