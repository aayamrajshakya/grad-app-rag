## Subawards on your Proposal
A subaward is the funding mechanism used when a project requires the participation of a separate, external entity (also known as a “subrecipient” or “subawardee”).
Funding would flow from the prime funding agency, through Northeastern (otherwise known as the “pass-through” entity), and onto the subrecipient. However, it’s important to distinguish the difference between a subrecipient versus a contractor or vendor:
Subrecipient | Contractor/Vendor  
---|---  
Has a programmatic, substantive role in the project | Has not participated significantly in the design of the work  
Named on publication as co-author or publishes their own work | Would not be named on publication or seek to publish on own  
Participates in design/conduct of the program | Not directly responsible for determining research or project results  
Some independent decision making | Little or no independent decision making  
More guidance on determining a subrecipient versus a contractor/vendor can be found on the [Federal Demonstration Partnership (FDP) Subaward Forms](https://thefdp.org/demonstrations-resources/subaward-templates-and-tools/) website under “Tools.”
When considering the inclusion of a subrecipient within your proposal, it’s also important to consider the funding agency’s guidelines, as the documentation requirements can vary. However, at minimum, NU-RES will always require the following elements from participating institutions being included as to be a subrecipient on any Northeastern award:
Letter of Intent or Commitment–[Letter of Intent ](https://res.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Letter-of-Intent-Commitment-1.8.24.pdf) template or their own form, Non-U.S. Subrecipients on NIH proposals must use this template.
