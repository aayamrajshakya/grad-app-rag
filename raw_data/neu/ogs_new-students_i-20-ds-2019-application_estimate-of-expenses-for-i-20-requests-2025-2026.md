All international students are required to show proof of sufficient funding for all educational and living expenses for one academic year as part of their I-20/DS-2019 request and F-1/J-1 visa process per [Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations.](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstudyinthestates.dhs.gov%2Fstudents%2Fprepare%2Ffinancial-ability&data=05%7C02%7Ca.hogan%40northeastern.edu%7Cce19e92eb66543c5b60008dc80ea22b3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638526990295899625%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=q2LHMIIvqR0EgnydHoy4QVPDBeRhQ3kYmEwDuGYPxis%3D&reserved=0) For information about acceptable types of funding, please [visit the financial requirements webpage](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.northeastern.edu%2Fogs%2Fnew-students%2Fi-20-ds-2019-application%2Ffinancial-requirements%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ca.hogan%40northeastern.edu%7Cce19e92eb66543c5b60008dc80ea22b3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638526990295913045%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=FfTMWVYD%2Br1%2BMdXbmCTnAHakC0eLIbVOr%2FGU2G%2BEoiw%3D&reserved=0).
NOTE: The below list of estimated expenses is not the same as what may appear on your tuition bill. The list of estimated expenses is strictly for I-20/DS-2019 and visa purposes. If you have questions regarding your tuition bill or payments, please [visit the Student Financial Services website](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstudentfinance.northeastern.edu%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ca.hogan%40northeastern.edu%7Cce19e92eb66543c5b60008dc80ea22b3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638526990295922273%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DNcl5itFc6Fsj3zx1QDXb2zpXYyyw9pYX2KtiUBRdA8%3D&reserved=0).
For I-20/DS-2019 and visa issuance purposes, you are only required to show proof of funding for your first academic year, however funding must be available to cover your academic and living experiences for the entire duration of your program from your personal or sponsored funding sources. Please note, international students are not eligible for U.S. financial aid. In addition, DHS regulations limit employment opportunities for F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status, as these are student and exchange visitor visas, and therefore, students should not plan to use income earned in the United States to support tuition or living expenses. Employment opportunities are ancillary benefits of being on F-1/J-1 non-immigrant status and are not guaranteed.
