She is also a Member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Professor Cross’s work investigates the long-term driving forces behind breakthroughs in international cooperation at both the elite and societal levels. She has specific expertise in space diplomacy, public diplomacy, European Union and transatlantic relations, security cooperation, and soft power ([CV](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Maia-Cross-CV-April-2024.pdf)). Her current research, supported by a major grant from Carnegie Corporation of New York, is [Transnational Political Networks and the Future of Global Order](https://maiakdaviscross.com/transnational-political-networks/ "Original URL: https://maiakdaviscross.com/transnational-political-networks/. Click or tap if you trust this link."), which will result in around 20 new case studies, including the global network catalyzed by the Polynesian Voyaging Society ([Hokule’a](https://hokulea.com/ "Original URL: https://hokulea.com/. Click or tap if you trust this link.")). She holds a PhD in Politics from Princeton University, and a bachelor’s degree in Government from Harvard University.
She is the author or co-editor of six books, including most recently International Cooperation Against All Odds: The Ultrasocial World (Oxford University Press, 2024). This book draws upon new insights about human nature from evolutionary biology, neuroscience, cognitive psychology, anthropology, among others, to examine the underlying causes and processes that have led to unanticipated instances of international cooperation across time.
Her previous books include, European-Russian Power Relations in Turbulent Times (University of Michigan Press, 2021) and The Politics of Crisis in Europe (Cambridge University Press, 2017). She is the winner of the Best Book Prize from the University Association of Contemporary European Studies for Security Integration in Europe (University of Michigan Press, 2011). In addition to these major works, Professor Cross has also written over 50 articles and book chapters.
