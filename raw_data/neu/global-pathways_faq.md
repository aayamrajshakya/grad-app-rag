#  FAQ 
You're not alone, here's a list of frequently asked questions about the Global Pathways program. 
### What grades and English level do I need for Northeastern?
You need good grades in previous academic study that are equivalent to the minimum Grade Point Average (GPA) for entry to your chosen degree, whether you join a pathway or enter directly.
You can start with a Global Pathway program if your English level does not yet meet the requirements for a graduate degree. Your English proficiency determines the length of your pathway program, 1 or 2 semesters (1 term for Accelerated Pathways for CPS Graduate Programs).
Generally, we accept scores from any of the following English language exams:
  * Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL)
  * International English Language Testing System (IELTS)
  * Pearson Test of English (PTE)
  * Duolingo


If you have advanced English proficiency, you may be able to join a graduate program immediately.
