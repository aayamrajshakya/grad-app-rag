What if I cannot start classes in the summer? 
While most students begin the MS in Accounting program in late May/early June, a September start is also available. This option follows a unique timeline, as no classes are offered during the spring term.

Are there other application requirements for international students? 
Yes. International students must meet additional requirements, including proof of English language proficiency, a valid passport, and English translations of academic transcripts.
