## Master of Public Administration Overview
The Northeastern Policy School’s MPA takes an experiential, research-based approach to leading in the public sphere. Students develop core leadership, budgeting, management, and analysis skills, which they supplement with elective courses reflecting their individual interests. Public administration graduates enter or advance in government and non-profit careers as program directors, management analysts, research analysts, town administrators, and more.
Our MPA curriculum incorporates experiential partnerships with governments and nonprofits. The Policy School partners with public and non-profit organizations to offer co-op, capstones, and internship opportunities. 
Students can take all courses online, on campus, or via a combination of virtual and in-person classes.
All online classes are offered asynchronously, and all on-campus courses take place after 5 p.m.
