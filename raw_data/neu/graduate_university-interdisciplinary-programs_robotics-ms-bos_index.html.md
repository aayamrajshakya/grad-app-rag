The multidisciplinary Master of Science program in robotics offers instruction by the faculty of the College of Engineering, Khoury College of Computer Sciences, and the Bouvé College of Health Sciences. The program is designed to provide students with comprehensive training in algorithms, sensors, control systems, and mechanisms used in robotics.
In this degree program, students will be admitted to the college associated with their concentration, and their degree is awarded by that college. The concentrations are associated with the colleges as follows:
  * Biomedical and Rehabilitation Robotics—College of Engineering 
  * Computer Science—Khoury College of Computer Sciences
  * Electrical and Computer Engineering—College of Engineering
  * Mechanical Engineering—College of Engineering


Students will follow all policies associated with their home college. 
## Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Master's Degree in Robotics with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Robotics in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 40-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 24 semester hours of advisor-approved robotics technical courses. For students who concurrently enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, 8 semester hours of the certificate coursework may be applied to this program’s elective requirements in the coursework option.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
