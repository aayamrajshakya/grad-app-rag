#  KellyGarneau
Teaching Professor in English 
Kelly Garneau joined the faculty at Northeastern in 2007 and teaches First-Year Writing and Advanced Writing in the Disciplines. She received her Ph.D. from Northeastern University, specializing in modernist American fiction, especially the role of technologies as models of memory and identity. Her interest in technologies and selves persists in a fascination with the ways the tools we use as writers shape how we express and even know ourselves. Kelly’s academic interests include online and hybrid course design and delivery, student-driven assignment development, multimodal composition, and exploring the factors that influence students’ confidence and identities as writers. In both First-Year and Advanced Writing, Kelly hopes to foster connections between students’ writing and their lived experiences, their passions, and their academic and professional work. Kelly lives on the South Shore with her family and a menagerie of pets, and spends her downtime reading old school paper newspapers, watching trashy tv, and walking dogs–anyone’s dogs.
