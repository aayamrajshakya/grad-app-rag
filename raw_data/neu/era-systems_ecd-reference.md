### Electronic Conflict Disclosure (eCD)
Northeastern University’s Compliance Department, the Office of the General Counsel, and Northeastern University Research Enterprise Services (NU-RES) collaborated to design an automated, real-time, accurate and flexible conflict disclosure system that enhances the University’s ability to manage potential conflicts within a wide range of critical functions. The result is eCD: a new electronic Conflict Disclosure system.
