## Explore the field of modern pharmaceutics.
A PhD degree in pharmaceutics is a research-focused degree. While coursework plays an important role, students become active participants in the science of pharmaceutics in the laboratory.
Students studying pharmaceutical sciences will be thoroughly exposed to the fundamentals of physical pharmacy and pharmaceutics and trained in several specialized areas, including:
  * Novel drug delivery systems
  * Nanomedical technologies
  * Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics


With exposure to these facets of the pharmaceutical sciences, successful graduates are poised to understand and assimilate the field of modern pharmaceutics. 
### Faculty Research
Faculty research in pharmaceutical sciences covers a broad range of scientific interests, including:
  * Pharmacokinetic toxicodynamics of anticancer agents
  * Use of novel biomaterials and synthetic polymeric systems in designing small-molecule drug delivery systems for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids
  * Passive and active targeting of therapeutic agents for cancer and cardiovascular diseases
  * Novel delivery systems for immunostimulating purposes; and mathematical modeling of endogenous compounds.
