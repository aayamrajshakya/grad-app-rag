Program Guidelines
  1. The Northeastern University Industry/Experiential PhD is an academic degree pathway offered by Northeastern to qualified individuals who obtain advanced-entry admission and wish to pursue their PhD degree while continuing to work full time.
  2. To participate, the student’s employer enters into an Academic Partnership Agreement, which includes an annual administrative fee that covers tuition and certain fees.
  3. In consideration of the student’s status as a full-time employee, the Academic Partnership Agreement confers certain benefits on the employer, including:
     * Permitting the student/employee to continue working full-time, and to engage in use- inspired research that is aligned to the employer’s business. In most cases, this research will take place at the employer’s site.
     * Providing favorable intellectual property rights in acknowledgement of company business goals.
     * Including an individual designated by the employer to serve on the student’s dissertation committee as an “industry advisor” and to monitor the student’s research progress.
  4. Our partnership agreement has been carefully drafted with the input of several industry partners to address the employer’s business needs while protecting academic values, the integrity of the degree program, the validity of the student’s research, and the university’s accreditation status.
  5. Because this is a Northeastern University academic program, the material terms of the Program Agreement are not negotiable. If the employer has specific operational requirements that need to be addressed by written agreement, the employer may submit an addendum to the Program Agreement, which the university will consider in good faith. However, any terms that seek to change the fundamental operation or academic components of the program or the obligations of the parties will not be accepted.


Frequently Asked Questions
How do I find a Northeastern advisor? 
You can look through faculty on the relevant program [site](https://phd.northeastern.edu/program/). Aim to identify 3-5 faculty members you would be interested in. We will ask you to submit those names in a future step. If you are deemed eligible and qualified, Northeastern will assist in connecting you with those faculty members.
Who can be my Industry Advisor? 
The Industry Advisor is someone from the company with the scientific background to provide guidance on the project and represent your organization’s interests. It is often a manager but does not have to be. We recommend the Industry Advisor has a PhD since they will be able to guide you not only on your dissertation project, but also on navigating the PhD process more generally.
When are applications due? 
Application due dates may vary by program. Many programs allow entry into any of our three semesters (Fall/September, Spring/January, Summer/May), but others only allow Fall entry. Typically, applications should be submitted one month before the start of the semester. However, they should not be submitted without having an agreed upon project and executed agreement and paperwork.
