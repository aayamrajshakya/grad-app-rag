## Training physician assistants since 1971 makes ours one of the most experienced programs in the nation.
Physician Assistants (PAs) are medical practitioners who practice collaboratively with a supervising physician. The PA scope of practice is authorized by state law and determined by the supervising physician.
PAs take medical histories, perform physical examinations, order diagnostic tests/studies, diagnose, develop and implement a treatment plan in consultation with the supervising physician, prescribe medication in all states, advise and educate patients on health promotion and disease management, provide inpatient hospital care for patients, and assist in surgery.
Physician Assistants provide care both in teaching institutions and in hospitals where there are no physician residents and are employed in health centers, multi-specialty medical group practices, emergency rooms, physician’s offices, and nursing homes.
As the role of the PA has expanded over the years, Northeastern has adapted its curriculum. While PA education concentrates largely on generalist medicine, more than a quarter of PAs now go into subspecialties. 
Northeastern has been in the forefront of creative utilization of PAs. You will be trained as a generalist provider in the traditional primary care environment and will also be prepared to work in new and emerging aspects of health care.
Northeastern University’s PA Program prepares students for national certification and meets the education requirements for professional licensure as a Physician Assistant in all 50 states and Washington, DC, enabling graduates to apply for a PA license anywhere in the country upon graduation from the program.
If you have questions or concerns regarding professional licensure, please contact program manager [Jason Parente](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#84eeaaf4e5f6e5eaf0e1c4eaebf6f0ece1e5f7f0e1f6eaaae1e0f1).

Academic Requirements, Policies, and Procedures for Enrolled and Prospective Students 
### Required Academic Standards to Maintain Enrollment and Progress in the Curriculum
Students are expected to maintain a minimum grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.0 (“B”) in all course work. If the cumulative GPA falls below 3.0, students are placed on academic probation. Only two courses may be repeated in meeting the GPA of at least 3.0 (“B”) required for the degree. “Satisfactory” and “Unsatisfactory” grades are not included in the GPA.
Students must receive a grade of “C” or better in each individual course. If a course grade is below “C,” students are placed on academic probation even if the GPA is above 3.0.
Students must obtain a GPA of at least 3.0 (“B”) in each semester. If the GPA for any semester is below 3.0, students are placed on academic probation.
Students who receive a grade of “F” or “U” in a course may make up the course based on their advisor’s recommendation and permission of the Program Director. Students are not permitted to repeat a course more than once and may only repeat two courses. As didactic courses are offered only once each year, students may have to wait at least one year to repeat a failed course or one in which they received a grade of “U.” In some cases, this could mean that students may not continue in the Program because they have not completed a prerequisite. Course credits earned in the Program are valid for a maximum of four years unless an extension is granted by the PA Program Director.
To be removed from probation, students must clear any deficient grades; maintain a 3.0 GPA in all future semesters without receiving an “I,” “F,” “U,” or “W” grade; meet the requirements listed above; and petition for removal from probationary status. Students who do not meet these requirements are subject to dismissal. Readmission to the program is at the discretion of the Program Admissions Committee.
An “I” (Incomplete) grade will be changed to a letter grade when the deficiency that led to the “I” is corrected to the satisfaction of and in the manner prescribed by the course instructor. A grade of “I” must be cleared within 30 calendar days from the date of its initial recording on a student’s permanent record. Students must sign an Incomplete Contract with the Program as required by the Registrar’s office and complete the terms specified prior to clearing the “I”.
### Requirements and deadlines for completion of the program
Students are required to pass a Summative Evaluation within the last four months of the program prior to graduation. Students are also required to successfully complete a Scholarly Paper/Capstone Project of publishable quality prior to graduation. A passing grade for the Scholarly Project is 73%
Students must have at least a 3.0 GPA upon completion of the Program to receive the Master’s degree.
Students must also meet all university requirements and deadlines as outlined in the Graduate Academic Catalog: [Graduation Requirements < Northeastern University Academic Catalog](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcatalog.northeastern.edu%2Fgraduate%2Facademic-policies-procedures%2Fgraduation-requirements%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cemilychooi.k%40northeastern.edu%7C4e7ffbfb218647a250c208ddeedf6648%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638929365455854901%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=F2PNtDt4XVbR8z%2BhuHCp1B8sMhMoFAOAhcdkIfdcGzY%3D&reserved=0)
### Policies and procedures for remediation
Remediation will be required of all students who receive a grade of 73% or below on any assignment. Remediation for grade replacement will not be offered for final exams in a course/module. The format of remediation will be decided by the Faculty Instructor of Record for each course. Successful completion of remediation will result in a maximum 10 percentage point increase in the exam grade up to 73% but not to exceed it. Remediation will be graded on a 10-point scale. The student must pass with at least a 7.3 out of 10 on the assignment. No additional points will be added to the initial exam grade if the student does not achieve a minimum of 7.3 out of 10.

Clinical rotations are a critical part of PA training. After successfully completing the didactic portion of the program in the first year, the subsequent 12 months are spent in clinical rotations. Rotations are assigned at a variety of medical settings. Because of Northeastern’s recognized focus on practice-oriented education and the PA Program’s longevity and reputation in the field, we can offer students a wide variety of clinical opportunities at hospitals, clinics, private practitioner’s offices, and multispecialty clinics. All students experience a broad diversity of patient populations and practice sites.
Students are not required to find their own clinical placements. We have long-standing relationships with many sites and supervisors and are able to place students in rotations. Every student receives an individualized rotation schedule and completes clinical rotations in each of the following areas of medicine. The sequence varies for each student.
  * Applied Clinical Study in Ambulatory Medicine (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Emergency Medicine (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Family Practice (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Medicine (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Mental Health (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Women’s Health (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Pediatrics (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study in Surgery (5 credits)
  * Applied Clinical Study Elective (5 credits)


Students may be required to complete up to three clinical rotations located up to 3100 miles from the NUPA Boston Campus, with opportunities across the country including California, Georgia, and Florida. Students are responsible for arranging travel and securing short-term housing.
Only the elective rotation is chosen by the student and may be done in any medical specialty either in this country or abroad. The Clinical Faculty must approve all elective rotations to ensure they fulfill learning objectives and provide adequate supervision.
Completion of a scholarly project by the end of the second year is required for graduation.

All other prerequisite courses taken at any other time must still have grades of solid B or better to satisfy our requirements. All other prerequisites remain the same. 
  * Prerequisite courses will not replace taking any component of the curriculum.


## Patient Care Experience
The Admissions Committee defines patient care experience as working directly with patients
  * Taking vital signs
  * Performing ECGs
  * Drawing blood
  * Changing bandages and dressings
  * Splinting, casting, removing sutures
  * Bathing and toileting
  * Scribing
  * Mental health counseling


The job title of the position is not as important as the specific duties performed. Administrative work in a healthcare setting or caring for family members will not be considered.
Patient care experience should be completed prior to applying by the August 1 deadline. Strong preference will be given to applicants who have 1000 hours or more of patient care experience prior to applying to the program. The strongest preference will be given to those with over 1800 hours of patient care experience prior to applying. Less than 1000 hours of patient care prior to applying will receive the lowest preference.
PA shadowing is not a prerequisite and does not count toward patient care hours. However, we highly recommend shadowing to acquire a solid understanding of the PA role.
Please be sure to review the FAQ section 
## Additional Prerequisites
  * **Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Providers Certification:**  
Students are required to have valid BLS certification no later than the start of the summer semester of the didactic year and prior to taking the ACLS course during that semester. Initial BLS certification must have an in-person component, and recertification may be done online. Students are required to ascertain on their own if they have taken an American Heart Association (AHA)-approved BLS certification course. Please do not contact the program about AHA approval as the program is unable to research the many local agencies that provide BLS training to ensure that they have AHA approval. BLS certification is not an application requirement.
  * **A laptop computer (PC or MAC) with a webcam is required in order to take online exams in class.**
  * _Criminal background checks are required for all students._  
This will be conducted upon matriculation.
  * _Access to a vehicle is required in order to travel to clinical sites._
  * **Travel may be required to distant rotations under special circumstances.**

  * Letters of recommendation (at least two clinically related)
  * Patient care hours  
Patient care experience should be completed before applying. Strong preference will be given to applicants with over 1000 hours of patient care experience before applying to the program. A stronger preference will be given to those with over 1800 hours of patient care experience before applying. Applicants with fewer than 1000 hours will be given the lowest preference.
  * Reflections of clinical experience in relation to future goals in healthcare in the CASPA essay
  * Evidence of alignment with the program’s mission, vision, program goals, and core values in the CASPA essay and application materials  
Stronger preference will be given to applicants who demonstrate greater alignment with the program’s mission, vision, program goals, and core values in the CASPA essay and application materials.
  * Overall impression of the application relative to the Northeastern PA Program


### Personal Interviews
Approximately 200 candidates are interviewed. Interviews will be conducted virtually and are usually scheduled in November/December.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) 
### Course Prerequisites FAQs
#### Can I apply if I still need to complete a course prerequisite?
Applicants with outstanding degree completion and/or a single outstanding prerequisite course will be considered if successfully completed by June 15th prior to matriculation. If you are completing one final course, be sure it is listed under “Courses in Progress/Planned” on the CASPA application
#### What should I do if I submit my CASPA application in the spring and still plan to take courses during the summer?
List all “in progress” and “planned” courses on the CASPA application. As soon as final grades are available, it is your responsibility to notify the program and promptly send an official transcript directly to the program so we can update your file. Electronic transcripts are preferred. We do not have early decision or rolling admissions, so there is no advantage to submitting your application early. 
If you are still taking courses in the spring and summer semesters, you might consider waiting to submit your CASPA application so that the final grades appear on your application. All applications will be considered as long as they are complete and are submitted by the August 1 deadline at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, verified by CASPA by August 31 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, and we receive the $75 Northeastern application fee by August 1 at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time.
#### Does Northeastern require any material in addition to the CASPA application?
We do not have a supplemental essay question to be completed as part of the application process. Additionally, Northeastern requires a $75 application fee in addition to the CASPA application fee. For instructions on how to submit this fee, please refer to the section entitled “Northeastern $75 Application Fee” on this page under the “[How to Apply” section](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/physician-assistant-ms/#how-to-apply).
#### What if my anatomy and physiology courses did not include a lab and are only 2-credit courses?
An Anatomy and Physiology lab is not required. The Admissions Committee does not evaluate the Anatomy and Physiology prerequisite based upon course credits. Rather it is the course content that is important. Both the anatomy and physiology of the entire bodyall body systems
Any combination of courses that covers full-body anatomy plus full-body physiology is appropriate as long as all systems have been included. The most common combinations are A&P 1 plus A&P 2 or an anatomy course plus a physiology course. Either a one semester or a two semester course is appropriate if as long as all systems have been included. All components of the Anatomy and Physiology sequence must have grades of solid B or better.
#### Will courses taken during the summer term fulfill prerequisites?
Courses taken in the summer will be accepted if they are considered equivalent courses by the school offering them and they adhere to our guidelines regarding the type and content of the course.
#### Will I satisfy the biology or chemistry prerequisite if I earned a grade below a solid B in one biology or chemistry lecture course but earned grades of a solid B or better in at least 2 other biology or chemistry lecture courses?
You need to have a minimum of 2 biology lectures plus 1 biology lab and a minimum of 2 chemistry lectures plus 1 chemistry lab all with grades of solid B or better to satisfy the biology and chemistry prerequisite. Any combination of basic and upper-level biology or chemistry courses is acceptable. For example, if you took 5 biology lecture courses and earned grades below solid B in only 2 of them, you would still have 3 biology lectures with grades of solid B or better. Any combination of biology and chemistry courses (basic and upper level) taken at a regionally accredited 2-year or 4-year institution is fine.

The job title of the position is not as important as the specific duties performed. Administrative work in a healthcare setting or caring for family members will not be considered.
#### Does volunteer work count as patient care experience?
Patient care experience can be obtained through paid and/or volunteer experience.
#### What if I have not completed the necessary hours of patient care experience by the application deadline?
Patient care experience is strongly preferred but not required. Strong preference will be given to applicants who have approximately 1000 hours of patient care experience prior to applying to the program.

OEHN will collect appropriate information and engage the doctor on call, who can help direct appropriate care depending on exposure and circumstances.

### Student Mistreatment Policy and Reporting
This policy aims to foster a respectful, supportive, and safe learning environment for PA students, free from mistreatment and discrimination. PA students should expect professional and equitable treatment from faculty, staff, peers, and healthcare professionals.
#### Definition of Mistreatment 
The PA Program is a behavior that shows disrespect for medical students and unreasonably interferes with their respective learning process. Such behavior may be verbal (swearing, humiliation), emotional (neglect, a hostile environment), and physical (threats, physical harm). When assessing behavior that might represent mistreatment, students are expected to consider the conditions, circumstances, and environment surrounding such behavior. Medical training is a rigorous process where the welfare of the patient is the primary focus that, in turn, may appropriately impact behavior in the training setting. Students should consider the context and environment when evaluating behavior that may qualify as mistreatment, keeping in mind that medical training is demanding and prioritizes patient care, which can impact behaviors in the learning setting.
Examples of mistreatment include (but are not limited to):
  * Harmful or offensive actions
  * Verbal attacks or excessively harsh language
  * Public humiliation
  * Physical harm (e.g., hitting, slapping, or kicking)
  * Assigning personal tasks (e.g., shopping, babysitting)
  * Intentional neglect or lack of communication (e.g., in a clerkship, neglecting students interested in a different medical field)
  * Ignoring student safety
  * Demeaning comments about a student’s career choice
  * Assigning tasks as punishment rather than for educational or evaluative purposes
  * Unjustly excluding students from educational opportunities
  * Other behaviors that violate the trust and respect essential to the teacher-student relationship also constitute mistreatment.


#### Reporting Process 
  * Students who experience or witness mistreatment are encouraged to report incidents promptly. Reporting options include:
  * Contacting the PA Program Director.
  * Contacting the Director of Clinical Education.
  * Filing a report through Northeastern University [Office for University Equity and Compliance](https://ouec.northeastern.edu/).
  * Contacting the University [Ombuds for Graduate Students](https://graduateombuds.northeastern.edu/).


If this is an EMERGENCY situation, CALL 911 from off-campus or contact the Northeastern University Police Department at 617-373-3333. Do not use this form to report events that present an immediate threat to health or safety.
#### Investigation and Response 
All reports are treated with confidentiality and investigated in a fair, timely manner. Actions taken may include mediation, counseling, or disciplinary measures against offending parties.
#### Anti-Retaliation and Confidentiality 
The institution strictly prohibits retaliation against students who report mistreatment or participate in investigations.
#### Resources and Support 
Students may also contact on-call campus medical and psychological professionals at UHCS by calling:  
617-373-2772 or through [Find@Northeastern](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3056595e54705e5f4244585551434455425e1e555445), which offers 24/7 mental health support via phone at   
877-233-9477 (in the U.S.) or +1-781-457-7777 (outside the U.S.).
