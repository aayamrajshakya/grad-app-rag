#  Students Studying in The United States 
As a J-2 dependent, you may be eligible to request authorization from the government to work in the U.S. The information on this page will provide you with eligibility requirements and application instructions. 
###  Changes to Paper Filing Payment Options Starting October 28, 2025 
Effective October 28th, 2025, USCIS is no longer accepting personal checks, money orders, or bank checks as payment for paper I-765 application fees. Please refer to the “Application Process” section below for updated fee payment instructions.
##  Overview 
J-2 dependents who enter the U.S. in J-2 status and are currently present in the U.S. are eligible to submit an application to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) in order to work in the U.S.
The processing time for EAD card applications varies, and can take up to 3 months. The application cannot be submitted until the J-2 dependent has entered the U.S. in J-2 status, and can only be submitted while the J-2 dependent is physically present in the U.S.
The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J-1’s DS-2019. If the J-1 principal extends their DS-2019, and the J-2 would also like to extend their work authorization, they will need to submit a new I-765 application to USCIS to renew the EAD. J-2 dependents are only authorized to work during the dates authorized on their EAD card.
Both part-time and full-time work are permitted using a J-2 EAD card, however any income earned through J-2 employment should not be for the intention of supporting the J-1 principal. J-2 dependents are encouraged to include a support letter, written by themselves to USCIS, with their EAD application to clarify how prospective future employment will not
