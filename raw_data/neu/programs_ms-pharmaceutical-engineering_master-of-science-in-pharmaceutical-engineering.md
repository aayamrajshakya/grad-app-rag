Program overview 
##  Evolve with the biotechnology industry 
The Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Engineering is an interdisciplinary program offered through the Department of Chemical Engineering and the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences at Northeastern University.
Through coursework and rich experiential learning, the program prepares engineers with a unique blend of advanced skills in state-of-the-art pharmaceutical design, manufacturing process engineering, and regulatory and quality issues to meet the evolving and growing needs of the biotechnology industry.
The program emphasizes the most current research in biopharmaceuticals-the fastest-growing segment of the pharmaceuticals field-and covers highly relevant topics, including mRNA. Students will also gain a strong understanding of Quality by Design (QbD) and its importance in FDA review.

Unique features 
  * The program is non-thesis-based.
  * Students have the opportunity to gain advanced interdisciplinary training in chemical engineering and pharmaceutical sciences with core and elective classes in both.
  * Students may choose to focus on either engineering or pharmaceutical sciences courses or on such areas as regulatory issues to balance current strengths and design their own career paths.
  * Students gain hands-on experience in modern experimental techniques, including bioreactor operation, downstream purification, and cell culture.
  * With Northeastern’s top-ranked co-op program, students may gain up to eight months of full-time work experience as part of the academic curriculum, allowing them to build their resume, develop a professional network, and gain a competitive edge upon graduation.
  * A premier location in Boston-a hub of high-tech and biotech-and its industry collaborations create innovative co-op opportunities for pharmaceutical engineering students.
  * One of only a few master’s programs nationwide combining engineering and pharmaceutical sciences.


Career outlook 
There is a growing need for engineers with advanced skills in state-of-the-art pharmaceutical design, manufacturing processes, and regulatory and quality aspects, including cross-functional pharmaceutical engineering knowledge in clinical development, manufacturing, and rigorous quantitative approaches.
This program is one of only a few nationwide that combine engineering and pharmaceutical sciences to address this market need. Upon graduation, students will be prepared for in-demand roles in bio-manufacturing, validation/regulatory compliance, quality control, and more.
Along with California, Massachusetts offers the nation’s strongest market for careers in pharmaceuticals, especially biopharmaceuticals.
Gain real-world experience 
As part of the MS program, you’ll gain real-world experience in modern experimental techniques, including bioreactor operation, downstream purification, and cell culture.
Through our signature co-op program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 2,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepares students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
