Program overview 
##  Construction management expertise 
In the last 10 to 20 years, construction in both the public and private sectors has become increasingly complex, requiring dynamic and strongly skilled construction and project managers for effective results. Along with offering a broad introduction to the principles of construction management, this graduate program also explores alternative delivery methods and controls for construction projects; safety, project risk, and quality management; team leadership; and negotiation skills and techniques. The certificate is intended for owners’ representatives, consulting engineers, architects, design engineers, contractors, and subcontractors. Individuals with a Bachelor of Science (but not necessarily in construction) and whose companies have identified them as having high potential for advancement are also good candidates for the program.
