## We prepare future speech-language pathologists for the rigors of clinical practice
With a Master of Science (MS) degree from Northeastern University’s Speech-Language Pathology program, you will influence society in profound ways — for example, enabling children with autism to communicate effectively, relieving adolescents’ fears of speaking dysfluently in the classroom, and helping stroke survivors resume activities in which they had previously participated. Our program has a strong interprofessional focus.
Our faculty consists of internationally recognized researchers
[Faculty research](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/academics/school-of-clinical-and-rehabilitation-sciences/communication-sciences-and-disorders/research/) spans everything from evidence-based practice using augmentative and alternative communication, software development for unintelligible speakers’ ability to learn to use inflection to communicate, to research focuses include speech-motor control and language and health literacy in at-risk populations.
Strong faculty links with world-recognized educational and medical institutions provide our students with the opportunity to apply classroom theory to evidence-based speech-language pathology interventions in the field.
Northeastern’s graduate speech-language pathology program is highly regarded, and off-site supervisors find our students well-prepared for clinical practice. Following graduation, many of our students are offered employment at sites where they interned.
Graduates go to work in educational settings, medical settings, research laboratories, private practices, skilled nursing facilities, and more. The academic, clinical, research, and service opportunities that comprise our SLP graduate program allow our students to acquire the knowledge and skills needed for a lifetime of professional achievement and social contribution.
## Speech-Language Pathology–Connect
For students who do not have prior experience in communication sciences and disorders or speech-language pathology, but want to embark on obtaining a master’s degree and entering the field, we have launched the Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology—Connect program, offered on our [Boston](http://graduate.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-speech-lang-path-connect/master-of-science-in-speech-language-pathology-connect-boston/) and [Charlotte](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-speech-lang-path-connect/master-of-science-in-speech-language-pathology-connect-charlotte/) campuses. During the first semester, you’ll complete prerequisite bridge coursework by selecting at least three of five available 3-credit courses. Academic advisors will help you choose which courses to take based on your remaining requirements. You may take up to all five courses if necessary. To advance to the fall semester, students must earn a grade of “B” or better in all bridge courses.
The Speech-Language Pathology—Connect program application deadline is October 15, with a Summer I entry term. As with the main Speech-Language Pathology MS program, applicants must complete their application via [CSDCAS](https://csdcas.liaisoncas.com/).

## Curriculum
The Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology requires a total of 60 semester hours at the graduate-level. Course work is required in core areas of clinical practice, scientific theory, and research/statistics. 
Clinical practica (Clinic 1-4) are in variety of settings both on and off campus. Students may choose either a thesis or a non-thesis option. Students who choose the non-thesis option must pass a Comprehensive Examination to graduate.
Throughout the Program, students must maintain a minimum grade average of B (3.0) in academic courses and in clinical work. Following graduation, students are eligible for state educator licensure and are ready to start their Clinical Fellowship Year.
SLP graduate students may also apply for admission to an Early Intervention Certificate Program. More information about the [Early Intervention Program](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/early-intervention-certificate/) may be found on their webpage.

## Experiential Learning and Clinical Opportunities
Our program’s clinical home is the Northeastern Speech-Language and Hearing Center, housed in the state-of-the art Behrakis Health Sciences Center. Individuals of all ages from surrounding communities come to the highly regarded Center for diagnostic and therapeutic services. Here, beginning in their first semester of Clinic (Clinic 1), students engage in rich clinical experiences under the guidance of highly skilled clinic supervisors. Learn more about the [Speech-Language and Hearing Center](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/speech-language-and-hearing-center/).
In subsequent clinical placements, students work multiple days a week as student clinicians in a variety of settings. Consistent with ASHA guidelines, on-campus and off-campus clinical assignments provide students with hands-on experience evaluating and/or treating children and adults with a range of diagnoses, disorders, and impairments such as language, cognitive-linguistic, and swallowing disorders:
  * articulation and phonological disorders
  * congenital or acquired hearing loss
  * developmental language problems
  * English as a second language/ accented speech
  * fluency problems
  * language and cognitive impairments due to stroke, brain injury, and progressive neurological diseases
  * motor speech disorders, such as dysarthria and apraxia, which may result in the need for augmentative or alternative forms of communication (AAC)
  * swallowing disorders
  * voice and resonance problems


While many of our external clinical sites are accessible by public transportation, not all are. Consequently, it is necessary for students to have access to a car during the semesters that they are enrolled in Clinics 2-4. Availability of a car increases the options for placement sites at which students have opportunities to gain diverse and extensive clinical experience.
Northeastern University emphasizes service to the inner-city neighborhoods of Boston and to surrounding communities. Through some of the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders’ community service links, students have opportunities to participate in speech-language-hearing screenings at local schools and hospitals and to facilitate children’s story-telling groups at local family homeless shelters.
