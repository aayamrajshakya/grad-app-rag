At Northeastern, [experiential learning](https://www.northeastern.edu/experiential-learning/) isn’t just a part of the curriculum—it’s at the core of the institution’s educational philosophy. As you explore your graduate school options, understanding the impact of real-world experiences integrated into your academic journey is crucial. Northeastern’s commitment to experiential learning transcends traditional education by connecting students with industry leaders and valuable work experience opportunities.
## What is experiential learning?
Experiential learning
“It’s an approach that’s fully embedded into the learning journey,” says Charles Kilfoye, assistant teaching professor and former assistant vice president of employer engagement and career design at Northeastern. “You get the opportunity to apply the classroom skills and theory that you’re learning to a real business problem with a real sponsor and see the results firsthand.” 
This immediate connection with major companies around the world underscores Northeastern’s approach to experiential learning across all its colleges and levels of education. With more than [3,500 employer partners](https://facts.northeastern.edu/#learning) around the world, Northeastern students have endless opportunities to transform academic concepts into industry skills. 
## How experiential learning works at Northeastern
Northeastern University offers a variety of experiential learning opportunities to students. Our curriculum incorporates hands-on learning through in-class simulations and longer-term co-ops. In addition, our experienced faculty members effectively mentors students to bridge the gap between academic studies and professional success. Northeastern prepares students to enter the workforce as dynamic professionals who can innovate within it.
At Northeastern, students can participate in experiential learning anywhere around the world. Here are a few of the many categories in which you could put your classroom studies to work.
### Co-ops
With Northeastern’s co-op program, you can step into the professional world, working full time at leading organizations for up to six months. The co-op program allows you to shine outside the classroom, applying your knowledge in a dynamic work environment.
Students who participate in co-ops are able to work on projects, collaborate with co-workers, and learn what it’s like to work in their industry of choice—all while being a fully integrated team member. Co-ops are among the most popular experiential learning opportunities at Northeastern. Within the graduating class of 2017, [97% of students](https://careers.northeastern.edu/cooperative-education/) completed at least one co-op, while nearly half completed two.

### Internships 
Northeastern also offers traditional internships, which students typically complete over the summers or while taking classes during the school year. These experiences can be an excellent way for students to test out new career options or industries. 
Through internships, Northeastern provides valuable experiences that serve as springboards into your future career. These can be your chance to explore diverse fields, apply your academic knowledge in real-world scenarios, and carve out your niche in your chosen industry.
### Experiential learning at work 
Many Northeastern graduate students must [balance a career, school, family, and more](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/grad-school-or-work/). Completing experiential projects at work can help them get the most out of their education without additional stress. A project management student, for example, may implement a new management system at their office and examine the results in class, while a computer science student may use their new programming skills to create custom software for their business. 
### Service-learning 
Service-learning combines volunteer work with learning experiences. This can take a variety of forms, from service trips abroad to helping out at a local nonprofit. No matter the type of experience, it will relate back to the student’s career of choice. Service-learning can also connect to any industry. A business student may volunteer at a tax prep clinic, while someone interested in climate change may study and support resilience efforts in a coastal community. 
Through Northeastern’s service-learning, you can be sure that each project connects deeply with your career goals while making an impact, so every experience is a step toward personal and professional fulfillment.
### Experiential network projects
Not all experiential learning must happen outside the classroom. Through Northeastern’s Experiential Network (XN), students can work on in-class projects designed to solve problems for a business partner. They can analyze business data, develop strategies, and make recommendations for global partners within their industry. These short, flexible projects are embedded into dozens of Northeastern classes, ensuring that students are always connecting with the latest information from real companies. 
### Consulting 
Working individually or in teams, students research and analyze information to provide a report directly to a sponsoring organization. These consulting projects position students as subject matter experts and give them the opportunity to implement their studies into a real-time problem of practice. 
### Practicums, clinicals, and fieldwork 
Students get the opportunity to engage in practicums, clinicals, and fieldwork in certain career paths. These supervised experiences in hospitals, classrooms, and more allow students to work in their career of choice while receiving feedback and training from established professionals. 
### Capstone projects 
At the end of their academic careers, students have the opportunity to take on a capstone project that summarizes their learning. They can choose the scope and type of project, from creating a documentary to launching a startup, and work with faculty to bring their ideas to life. 
In addition to these experiential learning options, each course at Northeastern is designed with hands-on experience in mind. Faculty ground their courses in real-world, scenario-based assignments and classroom teaching, and they provide extensive space for feedback and reflection throughout the semester. This helps students connect their studies to situations they may encounter during their careers and promotes strong critical-thinking skills. 
## The value of experiential learning
With 98% of Northeastern’s students either employed or in graduate school within nine months of graduation, the power of experiential learning is evident. Here are some of the many benefits of experiential learning you’ll find. 
### Gain confidence 
Experiential learning opportunities aren’t manufactured—they happen in real organizations and in real time, which puts your knowledge to the ultimate test. Instead of encountering this for the first time after graduation, you’ll get the chance to refine your skills and experience work in the field before graduation, building confidence as you do. 
“Students engage with employers early and often,” Kilfoye says. “They don’t need to wait until they graduate to find out whether or not they can apply their skills successfully.” 
### Improve your resumé
In a[study](https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/offices/cmc/docs/nace/2019-nace-job-outlook-survey.pdf) by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, employers listed work experience through an internship or co-op as the primary way they differentiate between candidates. Many companies expect new hires to have the equivalent of 18 months of work experience, according to Kilfoye—which can be particularly difficult to reach when balancing work, school, and family, as many students must. 
Experiential learning is incorporated into your studies at Northeastern, making it easier to gain the work skills necessary to land a job after graduation. Between in-class projects, co-ops, and the opportunity to take on additional experiences as your schedule permits, you’ll develop a strong resumé and the skills to go along with it. 
### Grow your network 
[Networking](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/networking-opportunities-northeastern/) can be critical in any industry. Having strong connections may help you get a letter of recommendation, a mentor, or even a job. This can be particularly important for adult learners who are trying to advance or change careers. 
“Experiential learning allows you to scaffold opportunities while you’re completing a degree,” Kilfoye says. “A learner might start out with an XN project early in their program that turns into a co-op with the same sponsor, and that co-op may lead to a job there.” 
## Starting your experiential learning journey
