## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Introduction to Writing Studies](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 1410
Introduces the basic theories, history, methodologies, and debates surrounding the study of how people learn to write and how writing is used in home, school, work, and civic contexts. Considers writing itself as both a practice and an object of study. Explores historical, rhetorical, linguistic, cognitive, social, and critical approaches to the teaching, study, and practice of writing, both in the U.S. tradition and in international contexts (e.g., UK, France, China). Emphasizes research on the development of critical reading and writing practices and students’ understanding of their own experiences and practices of other groups. 
  * ###  [Writing in Global Contexts](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 2760
Explores the various ways that linguistic diversity shapes our everyday, academic, and professional lives. Offers students an opportunity to learn about language policy, the changing place of World English in globalization, and what contemporary theories of linguistic diversity, such as translingualism, mean for writing. Invites students to explore their own multilingual communities or histories through empirical or archival research. 


### [Writing and the Teaching of Writing ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 7392
ENGL7392 engages MA and PhD students in the theory, practice, and praxis of teaching writing at the university level, drawing on recent scholarship in rhetoric and writing studies. We will explore theories and practices regarding the nature of written expression; the role of diversity, inclusion, and equity in writing instruction; the research on how people learn to write and how that writing might be assessed; the historical contexts for required writing in US higher education; the nature of multimodal composing; and the environments and activities best help students learn writing. The goal is for each graduate student to develop a coherent position on the teaching of writing, along with practical teaching materials that can be employed at Northeastern and elsewhere.
