Complex network analysis is the quantitative study of interconnected systems that influence every aspect of our lives—from where we get our news and who we share ideas with, to how we travel and the people we interact with, to the products we purchase and the foods we eat. Networks are ubiquitous across natural and human-made systems, and their structure and dynamics can explain and help improve the greatest challenges of the next century such as pandemics, food scarcity, cultural polarization, and climate change. Expertise in the emerging field of complex network analysis, within the landscape of the rapid growth of artificial intelligence and machine learning, forms the foundation of the next generation of thought leaders. Northeastern University leads the way in this burgeoning field, offering a unique master's degree program in complex network analysis methodologies. The program is designed to equip students with the conceptual and analytical tools needed to find patterns of connections in networked systems and apply these techniques in real-world settings. The curriculum includes industry-aligned concentration areas of focus, enabling graduates to apply complex network analysis skills in impactful careers in the public and private sectors as well as in research. The concentrations for this program correspond directly to the following industry sectors:
  1. Public health and life sciences fields such as epidemiological modeling, public policy, and behavioral research
  2. Social or urban science and research fields such as urban planning, social network research, economics, education, criminal science, or public policy
  3. Finance or technological fields such as financial analytics, market research, or network analysis for business
  4. Biological systems modeling used across research and industry including network biology, drug discovery, or multi-omics mining


In this degree program, students are admitted to the college associated with their concentration, and their degree is awarded by that college. The concentrations are associated with the following colleges:
  * Complex Biological Networks—College of Science
  * Complex Social Systems—College of Social Sciences and Humanities
  * Economic and Technological Networks—Khoury College of Computer Sciences
  * Population Health Dynamics—Bouvé College of Health Sciences 


Students will follow all policies associated with their home college.
