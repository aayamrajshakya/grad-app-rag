#  Master of
Analytics is the integration of the major theories, tools, and approaches to identify and successfully communicate data-driven insights for informed decision making in the digital age. Analysts articulate and effectively defend the significance and implications of the work in data analytics in terms of challenges and trends in a local, national, or global context. They propose an effective path to resolution of an analytical problem that may be complicated by the competitive environment, opposing interests, and divergent or uncertain data and information.
