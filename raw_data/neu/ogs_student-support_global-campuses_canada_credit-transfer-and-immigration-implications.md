##  Credit Transfer and Immigration Implications 
Graduate transfer credits may be granted for courses completed at specially accredited institutions. Policies and eligibility criteria may vary by program, so please consult your college to learn whether credit transfer applies to your situation.
If you are transferring credits from a foreign institution or from an institution that is not a Designated Learning Institution (DLI) in Canada, please be aware that there may be immigration implications. We strongly encourage you to review these considerations carefully before proceeding.
Generally, time spent studying at foreign institutions or non-DLIs does not count toward eligibility or the length of Canadian immigration programs such as the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) or the Spousal Open Work Permit (SOWP).
### **Important Considerations for Transferring Credits and PGWP Eligibility**
Transferring previously earned credits may reduce the time you study at Northeastern University in Canada, which can impact your eligibility for immigration programs such as the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). Before making a decision, please carefully review the following key points:
#### **Key Considerations**
  * Only the time spent studying at Northeastern in Canada counts toward PGWP eligibility.


  * To qualify for a PGWP, students must complete a minimum of 8 months of full-time study at Northeastern in Canada.


  * The majority of your coursework at Northeastern University-Toronto or Vancouver should be completed on-ground and in person.


  * Students are strongly advised not to accelerate their program.


  * Taking as many on-ground courses as possible is highly recommended to support PGWP eligibility.


### **Important Consideration for Transferring Credits and Spousal Open Work Permit**
The spouses and common-law partners of some international students may be eligible for an open work permit. Starting January 21, 2025, your spouse or common-law partner may be eligible for an open work permit if you have a valid study permit and you’re studying in a master’s degree program of 16 months or longer. 
#### **Key Considerations**
  * If you transfer credits from a previous program, this may reduce the overall duration of the master’s program you study at Northeastern Canadian campus.


  * If your program length becomes shorter than 16 months due to transferred credits, your spouse or common-law partner may **not** be eligible for an open work permit under the current policy.

Students should carefully consider how transfer credits may affect both **PGWP** and **SOWP** eligibility and plan their program accordingly.
