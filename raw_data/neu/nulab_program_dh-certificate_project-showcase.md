#  Graduate Certificate inDigital Humanities
The digital “Atlas of Southern Memory” created by Caroline Klibanoff for the DH certificate in 2018.
Here are some of the innovative final projects that students have completed for the DH Certificate. 
**[Traversal and Reflection: Journeys in Jhumpa Lahiri’s Short Stories](https://ishabanerjee1.wordpress.com/)**
**Isha Banerjee, Spring 2025**
This project is an attempt at tracing elements in textual corpus. For the scope of this project, the student worked with the text corpus of two short story collections by Jhumpa Lahiri. By marking the names of the characters and the geographical places that they go to in the course of each short story, this project then traces the emotional associations for each of these journeys. As an exploration into creating visualizations for certain aspects of literature like figurative or metaphorical journeys or characters and emotional arcs, this project presents different visualizations for the data, which conveys the nuanced information about the journeys undertaken by the characters and how it ties to their individual emotional progression.

[Hogwarth Networks: A network analysis of the Hogarth Press](https://hogarthnetworks.com/)
**Emma Beckman, Spring 2025**
For Hogarth Networksnode 1edgenode 2[Data Dictionary & Network Legend](https://hogarthnetworks.com/methods/data-dictionary/) has a list of all of the edges in this network. For Hogarth Networks[GitHub repository](https://github.com/eslbeckman/hogarthnetworks) where the data lives, it is represented in JSON. The [Data Collection](https://hogarthnetworks.com/methods/data-collection/) page explains how the student turned the bibliography entries into tabular data. In this project, the edges have multiple attributes for increased detail. Attributes include the year, the certainty, and the relationship type. In the unimodal network, all of the nodes are people, and the edges have the attribute of the book title that the two nodes are connected through; in the bimodal network, books are

[The Rhetoric of Language Requirements](https://languagerequirements.wordpress.com/)
**Laura Joy Clarke, Spring 2025**
This site explores the rhetoric of graduate language requirements. Specifically, the student collected a corpus of language requirement policies from the websites of 95 English and Rhet/Comp Ph.D. programs based in the USA and analyzed them to see how these texts conveyed their [programs’ underlying beliefs](https://languagerequirements.wordpress.com/language-ideologies/) about what languages are valuable and why. Using [qualitative coding](https://languagerequirements.wordpress.com/methodology-and-coding/), she analyzed the texts to see what rationales (if any) they provided for language learning. This site displays some [selected findings](https://languagerequirements.wordpress.com/common-rationales/), reflections and discussions on those findings, and a place where you can [explore the language of these policy documents yourself](https://languagerequirements.wordpress.com/explore-language-requirements/).

[Learning from Runaway Notices](https://dmdevantier.com/Historical-Background/)
**Danielle DeVantier, Spring 2025**
This project was created with the intention to bring forward the lives of enslaved persons in North Carolina, focusing on the time period between 1850 and 1869 to include the Civil War era. They appear in the archive because they chose to run away from their enslavement. They rarely appear in other places in history and are not often named. By focusing on their presence in this archive of runaway notices they are brought to the forefront of history. This project examines who was running away and how runaway notices were structured. It is important to remember that the information and data gathered from these notices to bring forward the lives and histories of enslaved individuals is created from the language of enslavers. This language and information served the enslaver and is embedded with their biases, stereotypes, and prejudices toward enslaved persons. Realizing these biases is essential to reading through them to gain more information about runaways and enslaved persons.

**[Smog in New York Times and Los Angeles Times](https://smogandnewspaper.wordpress.com/)**
**Yunhan Dong, Spring 2025**
This project looked at New York Times and Los Angeles Times from 1950 to 1980, and focusing primarily on the period between 1960-1970, too see the influence of three major smogs in New York city to the Newspaper through analyze keywords(topics) and use Los Angeles Times as secondary target, to compare the difference and similarities between the two cities when facing smog. The student also used the period between 1960 to 1980 to discuss the Clean Air Acts and other efforts to fight air pollution, and their influence on frequency of keywords in the Newspaper. Through this project, the audience could understand what topics were perceived as important based on the frequency of keywords across time and the connection in newspapers between New York city and Los Angeles in this time period when people were living and fighting the smog, and also how did newspaper journalism and editor frame these topics in the newspaper.

[Tricksters Story: Archiving Songs, Rituals, and Memories of Social Justice](https://echoes.omeka.net/)
**Kehinde Ilegbusi, Spring 2025**
This is a history matters research project with two epistemic aims. First, to create an archive using soundscapes, discographies, photographs, public space, album covers, and oral history as a tool to remember memories of social justice produced in a troubled moment. The student sees this as part of digital worldmaking efforts aimed at a just and equitable world. After all, these artists deployed social justice anthems to fight for an equitable world. While the year 1977 is significant with the emergence of Afrobeat through Fela’s music in Nigeria and the black Atlantic communities, the year 2020 marked a renewed interest in social justice movements through the ceremonies of artists. The archives also draw us to lyrics and proverbs from precolonial to colonial periods as a background to connecting with postcolonial efforts towards a just and equitable world. The second aim is methodological, they argue for a ‘’digital historical logic’’ challenging digital history/humanities to make an argument out of archiving practices. Hence, I present artists whose performances challenged structures as Tricksters who invoked the visions of social justice.

**[Marriage Manuals Digital Exhibit](https://junipermjohnson.com/marriage-manuals-digital-exhibit/)**
**Juniper Johnson, Spring 2025**
This project explores the intersections of gender, domesticity, health, and sex education in the nineteenth-century in the United States in historic marriage manuals. During a time of huge social, industrial, political, and economic change in the United States, marriage manuals gained popularity as a form of conduct manuals detailing social etiquette, duties of marriage, child rearing, domestic education, physical fitness, and health. Written largely for women throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth century, marriage manuals as a genre are situated amidst several national debates involving the education of women, abortion and sexual health and wellness, the development of sexology, and eugenics in medicine and science. To explore the connection between textural and material structures and conceptualizations of gender, sexuality, and health, this project seeks to utilize computational text analysis (word embedding models) to explore the relationship between semantic concepts and knowledge organization across a textual corpus of 30 marriage manuals published from 1836-1910. This project further uses close reading in two cases studies on 1) gender and sex and 2) authority and authorship to situate and extend the corpus-level analysis of marriage manuals as a genre. Overall, this project seeks to illustrate how different levels of textual analysis with digital tools can be used to explore and model the complexities of marriage manuals as a source of intersecting forms of knowledge in the nineteenth century.

**[Abortion Clinic Terrorism Database](https://abortionclinicterrorismdata.com/)**
**Grace Rooney, Spring 2025**
This project was conceptualized to meet the need of a searchable database for terrorist incidents against abortion clinics. The database in this project intends to be a much smaller, and more individual database to capture the experiences of those that are contained in this database. To achieve this goal, the student expanded upon the data in the Global Terrorism Database, as well as created some data of my own to address the missing data from the GTD. To this end, one of the goals of this project is to capture these individual experiences, in connection with the data. This case study is another way to tell just a few of these stories, and to make a comparative analysis of two major US cities that are common in the GTD data. The purpose of this case study is to examine both of these on a closer level than the database allows for. The two cities that will be analyzed are Cincinnati, Ohio and Pensacola, Florida.

**[Svalbardposten’s Digital News Archive: An Instance of Rodighiero& Danielou’s Weather Map](https://tinarosado.github.io/dataviz_svalbardposten_weathermap/)**
**Tina Rosado, Spring 2025**
This project is a component of a broader Master of Fine Arts thesis in Information Design and Data Visualization at Northeastern University. The thesis employs a Cultural Analytics approach to examine the visualization challenges of large digital archives, using Svalbardposten’s digital news archive as a case study. It explores and compares two distinct computational approaches and visualization techniques, analyzing their outcomes through the lens of Cultural Analytics principles. The results of the computational approaches and the visualizations of the study are intended as a concepetualization experiment and are not the intended final outcomes. The goal of this repository is to document methodologies used to visualize the newspaper archive through the implementation of [Rodighiero and Daniélou’s Weather Map (2023)](https://pure.rug.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/856541881/10.1515_9783111317779-017.pdf) and making them openly accessible.

**[Topic Modeling Early American Women’s Traveling Writing](https://github.com/rileyathompson/dh-project/tree/main)**
**Riley Thompson, Spring 2025**
This project investigates societal values in early American women’s travel writing and the possible influence the American Revolution had on societal values using the topic modeling tool MALLET. The project corpus is composed of ten travel writings, which include travel narratives, diary entries, and letters, written by white women between the years of 1704 and 1810. With of the five travel writings written before the American Revolution began and five written after the end of the Revolution, this project investigates whether or not the American Revolution influenced what societal values are reflected in women’s travel writing in early America.

[Did 2020 Alternative Music Mirror the Moment?](https://abbehar27.wordpress.com/)
**Arielle Behar, Spring 2024**
It appeared to me that 2020 was a year in which the lines between alternative and pop music seemed to blur. Thus, the student decided to dig deeper into 2020, recording the U.S. events that had transpired and the corresponding U.S. alternative music. They utilized the Billboard Alternative Airplay Chart to gather the trending alternative songs in 2020. From there, the student was able to record the chart peak and debut dates of each song. Subsequently, they researched the lyrics, bpm, key, songwriters, and producers of the songs. They were hoping that this information would show me trends between the music, such as whether songs in the key of A minor tended to chart more or whether male-written songs debuted faster on the chart after release. The student was also interested in seeing if the time between song release and chart debut was shorter than other years due to the increase in music consumption during lockdown.

Museums MA
**Samantha Frost, Spring 2024**
The Museums MA project is the culmination of a two semester-long digital humanities seminar at Northeastern University, created by a public history graduate student. The site is designed for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and early career professionals who are interested in working as public historians in small to midsize history museums, art museums, historical societies, and archives in Massachusetts. The project is scoped to include resources for those early career professionals seeking employment or schooling in Massachusetts as there are relatively few resources available to serve/support this demographic. However, while the graduate programs collection contains programs from Massachusetts colleges and universities, the remainder of the resources will be useful for anyone looking to learn more about the fields of public history and museum studies. This project also acts as a template for anyone looking to explore graduate programs and opportunities outside of Massachusetts, by serving as a community space where users can browse tags, search terms, and topics to use within their own explorations of public history opportunities.

Escaped Ads New Hampshire
**Laurel Schlegel, Spring 2024**
This project hopes to create a people-first database to understand the agency and liberation of people in New Hampshire and the greater Northeast as part of the larger Recovering Black History in Keene project. The archive is filled with the names of the newspaper “subscribers”: people with the means to purchase a weekly newspaper subscription and in a position of power that allowed them to view a person as having run away from them.

Recovering Black History in the Monadnock Region – Keene
**Ellie Witham, Spring 2024**
The Recovering Black History in the Monadnock Region is a citizen-archivist project. The lead archivist, Jenna Carroll, the Director of Education at the Historical Society of Cheshire County, volunteers, and a Northeastern University-based research team are tracing the history of African Americans in the Monadnock region of New Hampshire from the 1730s to the 1930s. This site is a digital collection of material relating specifically to the Black history of Keene, a city in Cheshire County. The material has been located in regional digital and physical archives; it includes documents from censuses, vital records, newspapers, probate records, family papers, etc. to identify Black individuals and experiences in 19th century Keene.

[Muhaddithat](https://muhaddithat.net/)
**Ayah Aboelela, Spring 2023**
Muhaddithat is the Arabic term for women scholars of hadith (verbal and practical teachings), whose work and lives are here emphasized in the data sheets and graphs. Although muhaddithat make up a minority in hadith scholarship, their role has had a lasting, integral impact. By creating open access datasheets specific to the muhaddithat, their teachers, students, and teachings, as well as visualizing their scholarly relationships and teachings in the form of a network graph, this project not only affirms the role they have played in Islamic scholarship since its earliest times, but it also uncovers the nuances of their roles–the kinds of people they taught and learned from, the trends in the types of hadiths they narrated, the cities in which their scholarship thrived the most, and so on.

[Mountain of Languages](https://mountainoflanguages.wordpress.com/)
**Zahra Aliyeva, Spring 2023**
The region of the Caucasus lying between the Black and Caspian seas has a very diverse population in terms of the languages, ethnic groups, and religions. From ancient times it has been of interest to historians and especially linguists. This research project visualizes and analyzes the sociolinguistic situation in the region of the Caucasus from the emergence of the Soviet period in 1922 to our present days. The ultimate goal of the project is to demonstrate the ways in which the Soviet policies towards the titular and minority languages and ethnic groups contributed to the current sociolinguistic situation.

The Rhetoric of Antislavery Project
**Zobeida Chaffee-Valdes, Spring 2023**
This project aims to use text analysis methods to complete a distant reading of a small corpus of abolitionist speeches delivered in 19th century Boston. Through using methods including word vector analysis and topic modeling, it will be able to find patterns in the ways Boston abolitionists spoke of slavery, abolition, citizenship, and patriotism. Factors include race of the orator, the space in which the speech was given, the occasion warranting a speech, and the time frame. While these findings will not be in any way conclusive or representative of abolitionist rhetorical trends as a whole (given my limited scope, and the small size of the corpus), the project will hopefully serve as a useful proof of concept for others doing distant readings of Abolitionist rhetoric and literature.

**[Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association Network](https://averyferro.wordpress.com/)**
**Avery Ferro, Spring 2023**
This project was born from many hours in the archives sifting through documents relating to women’s work during World War I and the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. The original purpose of this archival exploration was to study the connection between women’s work and organization’s fight for woman’s suffrage. However, as this connection emerged, so did a seemingly tangled web of committees within the organization. The project therefore expanded, rounding up all the committees and the women who made them up, untangling the web of names, subcommittees, and connections, and producing a visualization of the inner-workings of the Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association. Hopefully, this data and the visual network it produces will help scholars and create a better understanding of how the CWSA understood not only itself as an organization but how it fit into the larger, nationwide fight for woman’s suffrage.

**[The General Relief Committee of New York Project](http://annahalgash.com/the-general-relief-committee-of-new-york-project/)**
**Anna Halgash, Spring 2023**
The General Relief Committee of New York formed to collect American donations for the Irish Famine (1845-1852), which were then to be processed by the Society Of Friends (Quakers) in Dublin. This project investigates the donation patterns of the GRC’s first month of monetary donations (excluding food and provisions). International aid for the Irish Famine is a neglected historical subject, and American aid was especially intriguing considering the nation’s close connection to Ireland due to the significant amount of Irish immigration even before the Famine. By analyzing the initial donations of the GRC, this project explores how data visualizations and quantitative data can reveal trends and patterns of identity that strengthen scholarship that otherwise focuses on event summary and themes.

The key American tenets of liberty and equality have historically been withheld from certain citizens, a fact established early on in the creation of the new republic. Through an analysis of three broad categories – LGBT+, BIPOC, and Women’s History – The Unfinished History Podcast maintains that underrepresented communities played a significant role in the era of the American Revolution. Through six carefully crafted episodes featuring historical content and expert interviews, as well as digital creations and shout-outs supporting professional and amateur digital work, The Unfinished History Podcast seeks to contribute to scholarship that aims to fill the gaps in the historical narrative, especially those relying upon ‘the digital’ as a metric of analysis.

Shadows of Norumbega
**Benjamin Federlin, Spring 2022**
Shadows of Norumbega is a historical mapping project that charts the nineteenth-century commemoration of Leif Erikson and the imagined Viking city of Norumbega by the Harvard chemist Eben Horsford. The project shows Horsford’s role in preserving crackpot theories among Boston elites that Norse explorers settled in New England, and visualizes the locations of the monuments that Horsford commissioned and paid for along the Charles River. It also maps other monuments in Boston, giving information on their funding and construction to pose questions about who has financed these public monuments, and how that has shaped whose history is commemorated.

**Urmi Parekh, Spring 2022**
Decolonizing The Syllabus interrogates the composition of curricula from Northeastern University’s graduate English program to determine whether studied communities have been subjectivized, or whether they have been given agency to participate in the discourse. Drawing on a collection of syllabi from Northeastern’s English Department, the project focuses on the diversity of authors of assigned readings, how this has changed over time, and how authors from marginalized communities can be incorporated into reading lists. The metadata from these syllabi are organized and visualized in different ways to evidence how certain groups are privileged in English curricula.

**Anjelica Oswald, Spring 2021**
This project aims to showcase different ways that archival research can be presented digitally. It presents new ways to understand history by engaging with archiving and narrative storytelling. This project specifically features research on the women of both the Special Operations Executive (SOE), Britain’s espionage organization, and the United State’s Office of Strategic Services (OSS), the precursor organization to the CIA. The historical implications of women in intelligence roles are not always apparent. Though this project is not all-encompassing, this site shows examples of how widespread these espionage organizations were throughout the world and just how active women were involved, both in the office and in the field.

[Riots or Rebellions: Teaching Boston’s Racial Unrest](https://drose.org/dh2021)
**Danielle Rose, Spring 2021**
Americans have protested against injustice for centuries. When the protests turn violent, different terms are often used to classify them: civil unrest, riots, disorders, and rebellions, to name a few. What determines which term is used? Oftentimes, it is the race of those protesting. According to historian Jack Schneider, history has shown that white citizens who rise up against tyranny or inequality are honored as heroes or patriots. Conversely, when people of color do the same, they are usually labeled as rioters or troublemakers. These misnomers are generally perpetuated through mainstream media coverage that tends to focus more on the protest tactics and violence, rather than the underlying issues of the social movements themselves. Furthermore, scholars cite lack of diversity in news organizations, as well as biases against protests that do not follow the status quo, as some of the main reasons for inadequate—and at times, inaccurate—coverage of race-related protests. This, in turn, contributes to the delegitimization of the larger movements. The main goal of this project is to contribute to the larger discussion of how race-related protests are covered in newspapers and perceived by the general public.

The goal of this project is to explore the use of text analysis tools on scanned primary source journals that have been processed with optical character recognition (OCR) to see what kind of useful information can be obtained through these methods and how helpful this process can be as a research tool. This project is driven by questions of how employers within the stone industry approached workplace safety, health, and environmental issues. Are changes visible within the written record of the stone industry’s general publications? Was it a serious concern that was discussed between multiple employers within the industry or did these discussions not get a lot of attention in the general record?

Disability Media Archive
**Meg Szydlik, Spring 2021**
This archive was particularly inspired by the controversy over Bryan Cranston taking the role of a disabled person in a film. As a disabled person, Meg was actively against this decision and was seeing a lot of articles with wildly different opinions. However, Meg also noticed that a lot of these articles were not written by disabled people, but still purported to speak for them. Therefore, Meg decided to explore content that was written by disabled people about representation of disability in the media.

Topic Modeling Headline News About the Anti-Vietnam War Movement, 1964-1966
_Adam Tomasi, Spring 2021_
This project is a topic model of headline news coverage about the anti-Vietnam War movement between 1964 and 1966. Headline news shaped how a reading public understood the anti-Vietnam War movement at this time. Unlike editorials or advertisements that have a more obvious bent, headline news is ostensibly an imminent, neutral recounting of past events. But headline news is not neutral; journalists have to make choices about the selection, arrangement, and prioritization of data, which shapes the topics represented in the corpus.

[Coding the Bechdel Test](https://akblankenship.wixsite.com/codingthebechdel)
_Avery Blankenship, Spring 2020_
Coding the Bechdel Test is a comprehensive tutorial for developing a computational version of the Bechdel Test for nineteenth-century novels. Because this tutorial is invested in feminist coding practices, it does not assume that this code or this version of the test is the only solution that works, or works in the best way. As a result, users are invited to edit the code and try different methods for improving on this test. The code for this tutorial will be available as a Jupyter Notebook on Github and if any improvements are made to the code, users are encouraged to submit their improvements. This tutorial is deeply invested in feminist practice and inclusivity and welcomes feedback on the language of the tutorial as well as accessibility of material.

[remiXML: Incorporating XML in First Year Writing](http://caramartamessina.com/pedagogy/remiXML/)
_Cara Marta Messina, Spring 2020_
This project merges interest in fan studies, critical pedagogy, and DH by building an XML (extensible mark-up language) schema that asks student writers to remix shared readings and their peers’ texts. This schema, called the remiXML, is broken up into three sections: the metadata (descriptions of the file, author, remixer, and title), the original text (either the shared reading or a student writers’ assignment), and the play section (where the student writers create their interventions about the text).

[The Nastiest Cartoons](https://haileyphilbin.wixsite.com/nastiestcartoons)
_Hailey Philbin, Spring 2020_
The goal of this digital platform is to function as an exhibit space for some of the greatest American political cartoons. By analyzing how the interpretation of themes like racism and ethnicity, Presidential politics, gender roles, and symbols have evolved throughout modern political cartoon history, visitors to the site can learn how to decode cartoons from the past as well as today. As a demonstration of the evolution of political cartooning, this digital exhibit can function as a guide to gaining the skills it takes to understand generations of historical hilarity. This digital space will also serve to explore and describe a comprehensive evolution of modern American political cartooning by comparing the periods of work between three prolific cartoonists: Thomas Nast, Clifford Berryman, and Herbert Block.

[History Needs New Heroes](https://historyneedsnewheroes.com/home/)
_Megan Barney, Spring 2019_
History Needs New Heroes seeks to reveal who gets presented as a “hero” in high school American history textbooks from 1945 to the present. Through close reading and content analysis of three recently published textbooks, this project identifies missing voices. As a result, this project will write new narratives on American heroes that can inspire students to find stories that they can relate to in the present day.

[DEV 3D: A Historic Project Toolkit](https://bergnesselll.wixsite.com/dev3d)
_Lauren Bergnes Sell, Spring 2019_
Downtown Boston is brimming with historic sites and artifacts, but many of them remain inaccessible for a litany of reasons. 3D Modeling and digitization of spaces and artifacts allow greater accessibility to these spaces and artifacts that may lie behind geographical, financial, and physical barriers. This project utilizes the 18th-century tombs located beneath The King’s Chapel as a case study for exploring the role of these new technologies within exhibits and interpretive themes.
With a theoretical foundation nested in Yi-Fu Tuan’s “Space and Place: Humanistic Perspective” and 3D modeling and Public History theory, Dev 3D hopes to provide early blueprints and case studies for creating and implementing 3D models in a variety of ways within a historic/cultural space. The prototype toolkit contains a list of software, tools, and methods for constructing simple 3D artifacts that can be used to create 3D printed models, Augmented Reality apps, or digital exhibits.

[Rat(io)s in the Walls (of Text): An H.P. Lovecraft Digital Humanities Portfolio](https://haleyke.omeka.net/)
_Kenneth Haley, Spring 2019_
In recent years there has been a renewed interest in the work of H.P. Lovecraft, and a reassessment of his place in American literary history. Once relegated to the pulp magazines of the early 20th century, the past 20 years has seen Lovecraft’s work added to publishing lines such as The Library of America, Oxford World’s Classics, and the Penguin Classics line. Meanwhile, numerous “omnibus,” “definitive,” and “annotated” editions of his work have been released from various publishers. How and why has work that was published in a cheap, disposable format survived to this day and garnered such attention?
Rat(ios) in the Walls (of Text) attempts to examine the “how” portion of that question through the application of various tools developed as part of the growing field of the Digital Humanities.

[The Birth of Boston](https://nu.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Cascade/index.html?appid=e2cf8293643044b7abd736f4776fa6f5)
_Molly Nebiolo, Spring 2019_
It has been difficult to visualize Boston’s early history prior to [the first map of the city in 1722](https://www.masshist.org/database/1733). In the late nineteenth-century, Boston cartographer [Samuel Chester Clough](http://www.masshist.org/collection-guides/view/fa0276) attempted to remedy this problem by crafting maps of Boston using inhabitant data found in  _[The Book of Possessions](https://books.google.com/books/about/Bostontown_records_1634_1661_The_book_of.html?id=mP87AAAAIAAJ)_ , but never completed the project. “The Birth of Boston” is a twenty-first century attempt at reviving Clough’s venture into discerning what Boston looked like and who lived there during its settlement.
“The Birth of Boston” is an interactive webmap of colonial Boston that allows users to click on land parcels to learn about each inhabitant that lived there in 1648. Clough’s maps are the basis for the geographic information we have on the land ownership of settlers, but the second resource for this digital project comes from the [Annie Haven Thwing collection](http://balthazaar.masshist.org/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?v1=1&ti=1,1&Search_Arg=annie%20thwing&Search_Code=FT%2A&CNT=10&PID=2_uVKuHydblpvRrDfpUDf-tVS2&SEQ=20181109163728&SID=1). At the turn of the twentieth century, Thwing researched and created a corpus detailing the lives of over 50,000 Boston inhabitants from 1630 to 1822. This database of citizen information was used to give a “face” to the names that Clough has depicted on his map.

[Visualizing French Muslims](https://www.colleenlnugent.com/frenchmuslims/)
_Colleen Nugent, Spring 2019_
This project provides a new layer of context to the study of Muslims in France, through digital maps of the three French cities with at least 10% Muslim population. The laws regarding secularism in France, however, provided an immediate barrier to information, with a law from the late nineteenth century banning the collection of any data regarding race or religion. Therefore this project uses Islamic institutions, such as mosques, private Islamic schools, and halal restaurants and markets as a metric of potentially determining levels of assimilation. These maps also include the locations of public transportation stops, both buses and metro, with an assumption that accessibility to public transport can serve as an indicator of assimilation. For comparison, there is a comprehensive map that also depicts the locations of Catholic churches and Jewish synagogues.

[From Grateful Friends](https://fromgratefulfriends.com/)
_Katie and Megan Woods, Spring 2019_
From Grateful Friends explores public memory, the ways in which a collective group remembers its past. This project’s central focus is a prototype of a map that shows the physical forms of public memory (memorials, markers, museums, and a cemetery) of World War II in Luxembourg. Luxembourgers and Americans have worked to record and preserve the stories of their shared history from this time, with their mutual feelings of gratitude still present today.
A work in progress, the map will continue to grow with the addition of new stories and sites of memory. The map is joined by other tools visitors may explore: a historical timeline, blog, and resources. Through these elements, From Grateful Friends celebrates the coming together of two countries in war and reminds us of the richness of international friendship and camaraderie.

[The Digital Atlas of Southern Memory](https://carolineklib.wixsite.com/dasm)
_Caroline Klibanoff, Spring 2018_
In an era of fervent memorialization and contentious debates about who and what should be commemorated in the public sphere, the conversation has largely been limited to physical monuments such as statues, plaques, and landmarks. These structures advance narrow cultural narratives about the past, require significant capital to establish, and allow for no interaction or annotation by the public. As a result, there is little opportunity for most Americans to participate in what gets remembered – and yet the hunger is there, visible in heated debates, defaced statues, and renamed spaces cropping up in communities across the nation.
With a theoretical underpinning in collected memory studies and public history, the Digital Atlas of Southern Memory (DASM) presents a prototype for a platform that can enable broader participation in the commemoration process. It aims to be an engine for doing what public history, at its best, should do: meet modern, digital audiences where they are; help them connect with their own history, and awaken a curiosity — and usually, an opinion — about what they hope will be remembered.

[Angelenos Incarcerated: The LA County Jail Oral History Project](http://angelenosincarcerated.org/)
_Joanne DeCaro, Spring 2017_
The LA County Jail Oral History Project aims to document the conditions, culture, and recent history of the LA County jail system through the oral histories of former and current inmates. The project wishes to create an opportunity to grant an authoritative voice to the literally disenfranchised minority of the former and current local inmate population in Los Angeles County. Five oral histories have been gathered from those who were incarcerated in one of the LA County jails from the 1980s to the present day. The project’s long-term goal is to collect 80 to 100 oral histories to form a representative sample of former and current inmates, taking into account factors such as race, gender, and sexual orientation.
The underlying philosophical goals of the project are to provide an opportunity for inmates and former inmates to create authoritative narratives of their experiences in the LA County jail system in a manner that supports inmates regaining and reimagining ownership of their life stories surrounding incarceration and to foster dialogue and understanding with the inmate community and the general public.
