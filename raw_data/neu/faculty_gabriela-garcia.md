Gabriela Garcia is an assistant professor exploring the intersection between plants and people. As an ecologist, she is especially interested in how ecosystem dynamics on farms influence human decision-making, and how those decisions feed back to influence farm ecosystem dynamics. Through cross-disciplinary and collaborative research, she seeks to contribute toward an agroecological transition that preserves biodiversity and fosters socio-ecological resilience to a changing climate.
