#### Workshop Descriptions
Understanding Authorship: Ethics, Standards, and Best Practices (October 27, 2025)
Presenter: Professor Patricia Mabrouk, Chemistry, College of Science
**Workshop Details:**
Authorship is a cornerstone of academic integrity that carries both significant rewards and serious responsibilities. This comprehensive workshop explores the fundamental principles of scholarly authorship, from defining what qualifies someone for authorship to navigating complex ethical dilemmas. Participants will examine varying authorship standards across disciplines and publishers, understand the critical distinctions between different authorship roles, and learn to identify and prevent various forms of authorship misconduct.
Through case-based discussions and interactive scenarios, attendees will explore the balance between credit and responsibility in authorship, examine real-world examples of authorship disputes, and develop practical strategies for establishing clear authorship agreements. The workshop addresses contemporary challenges, including hyperauthorship, contributor roles taxonomy (CRediT), and the importance of ORCID identification in the evolving scholarly landscape.
This session is designed primarily for graduate students, postdocs, and early-career faculty who are beginning to navigate the complexities of scholarly publishing and collaborative research. While experienced faculty may find value in the content as a refresher, the workshop focuses on building foundational knowledge and practical skills for those newer to research. The session emphasizes proactive approaches to authorship decision-making and provides essential tools for addressing ethical challenges using evidence-based strategies and institutional resources.
