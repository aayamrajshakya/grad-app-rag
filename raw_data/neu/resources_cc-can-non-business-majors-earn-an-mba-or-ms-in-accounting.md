#  Can non-business majors earn an MBA or MS in Accounting? 
Published: July 13, 2024
You don't need an undergraduate business degree to pursue a [Master of Business Administration ](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/)(MBA) or [Master of Science in Accounting](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-accounting/) (MSA). While having one can strengthen your application, most MBA programs and advanced business degrees, such as an MBA or a [dual MSA/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/%20ms-accounting-mba/), welcome applicants from diverse academic backgrounds. 
This inclusivity allows individuals with varied undergraduate majors to transition into business-focused graduate programs, preparing them for careers in management, accounting, and related fields.
This article will explore the pathways and considerations for non-business majors looking to pursue these graduate programs. 
## Does your master's degree have to be related to your bachelor's degree? 
No, your master's degree does not have to be related to your bachelor's degree. While foundational knowledge in business can be beneficial when pursuing an advanced business degree, admissions committees typically prioritize qualities like leadership potential, work experience, and career aspirations over specific undergraduate majors. This allows individuals with various backgrounds including engineering, sciences, communication and other fields to pursue an advanced business degree and transition into roles that align with their professional goals. 
## Do you need a business degree to get an MBA? 
No, you don't need an undergraduate business degree to pursue an MBA. Many MBA programs accept students from diverse academic backgrounds, including engineering, humanities, economics, computer sciences, and social sciences. Admissions committees typically look for a combination of academic performance, work experience, leadership potential, and other qualities rather than requiring a specific undergraduate degree. 
While specific prerequisites can vary, most programs require applicants to have a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution. Some programs may also require prerequisite coursework in areas such as accounting, economics, or statistics for applicants without a business background, ensuring all students have a foundational understanding for MBA coursework. 
Admissions committees also value significant work experience. This work experience helps demonstrate a candidate's readiness for MBA coursework and improves their contributions to classroom discussions and group projects.

## How can you become an accountant with a different undergraduate degree? 
While some accelerated Master's in Accounting programs are tailored to students who majored in accounting during their undergraduate studies, there are pathways for individuals with different undergraduate degrees to become accountants. 
Many MS in Accounting/MBA programs are specifically designed for students without an undergraduate degree in accounting. These programs typically offer foundational courses in accounting principles and practices, ensuring that students acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to succeed in the field. 
Some programs may require prerequisite coursework in accounting or related areas to provide a solid foundation before advancing to more specialized topics. These educational pathways allow graduates from diverse academic backgrounds to pursue careers in accounting by equipping them with the essential qualifications and expertise the profession requires.
