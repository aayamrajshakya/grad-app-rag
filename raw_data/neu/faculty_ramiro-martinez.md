#  RamiroMartinez
Professor of Sociology and Criminology and Criminal Justice 
Ramiro Martínez, Jr. is a quantitative criminologist. Within that broad arena, his work contributes to violent crime research. His core research agenda asks how violence varies across ecological settings, and, whether violent crime and violent deaths vary across racial/ethnic and immigrant groups. He publishes in sociology, criminology, criminal justice and ethnic studies journals.
He and his collaborators assembled a multi-city team of researchers, graduate and undergraduate students to collect violence data directly from police departments and medical examiner offices in cities on or by the U.S./Mexican border (San Diego, San Antonio), in Miami, Florida which faces the U.S. border with the Caribbean, and other places, to answer these questions. This agenda has been funded through the NSF, NIH, NIDA, NIJ, and The Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation.
Over the past fifteen years, Dr. Martinez has received several honors and awards. In 2011, he was a recipient of American Society of Criminology DPCC’s Lifetime Achievement for outstanding scholarship in the area of race, crime, and justice. He was also honored by his alma mater (formerly known as Southwest Texas State University) in 2009 with the Texas State University College of Liberal Arts Distinguished Alumni Achievement Award and the Texas State Alumni Association’s Alumni Achievement Award. In 2007 he was a recipient of American Society of Criminology DPCC’s Coramae Richey Mann Award for outstanding scholarship in the area of race, crime, and justice. In 2006 he was a recipient of the Florida International University Faculty Award for Excellence in Research and a Visiting Scholar, Center for Mexican American Studies, University of Houston. He previously received the American Sociological Association Latinao Section Award for Distinguished Contributions to Research and a W.E.B. DuBois Fellowship from the National Institute of Justice. Since 2004 he has been a member of the National Science Foundation funded Racial Democracy, Crime and Justice-Network working group at The Ohio State University. At the national level, Martinez serves on the editorial boards of several academic journals and recently completed a three-year term as a member of the Sociology Advisory Panel at the National Science Foundation.
