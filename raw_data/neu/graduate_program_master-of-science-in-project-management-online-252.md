Accreditations 
The Master of Science in Project Management is accredited by the [PMI Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC)](https://www.pmi.org/). The GAC Accredited Program seal is a mark of Project Management Institute, Inc. In October of 2021, the Master of Science in Project Management accreditation was reaffirmed for the maximum five-year accreditation cycle (originally accredited in 2009) by the PMI GAC, the world’s leading association for project management professionals. Accreditation is achieved by meeting the GAC’s rigorous standards, which include an assessment of program objectives and outcomes, a review of onsite and online resources, evaluations of faculty and students, and proof of continuous improvements in the area of project management. Graduates of our GAC-accredited program are granted a substantial 12-month reduction credit toward the experience requirement when they complete an application for any PMI certification. This means that those applying for the PMI certification will only need 24 months of project management experience, instead of 36 months as outlined by GAC.
Unique features 
  * Students have the option to engage in experiential learning through the co-op program and/or Experiential Network projects.
  * The program curriculum can be tailored to students’ past professional experience with project management.
  * Concentrations allow students to focus their study on content-specific knowledge.
  * This is a STEM-designated graduate degree.


Career outlook 
According to PMI, through the decade ending in 2020, 15.7 million new project management roles will be created. The profession is expected to grow by US $6.61 trillion. Now is the time for professionals and job-seekers to build project management skills, as demand for these skills outstrips supply.
In the United States, this growth will mean:
  * Rising salaries
  * Growth in the project-intensive sectors of manufacturing, business services, finance and insurance, oil and gas, information services, construction, and utilities


In 10 countries (Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom) with established or quickly developing project-intensive sectors, project management roles are expected to grow by 13.4 million through 2020.
