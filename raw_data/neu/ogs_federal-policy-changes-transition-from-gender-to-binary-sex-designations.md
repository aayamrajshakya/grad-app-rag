#  Federal Policy Changes: Transition from Gender to Binary Sex Designations 
Updated July 16, 2025 (May 12, 2025) 
The Office of Global Services (OGS) is closely monitoring recent announcements from federal agencies regarding changes to how gender and sex are recorded in immigration systems and on official documents.
What’s changing? 
Federal agencies, including U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and the Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), have announced that federal systems will replace the data field labeled "Gender" with "Sex", with only two available options: male or female. This change will impact how records are created and updated in SEVIS and other immigration-related systems.
Key points: 
  * For applications submitted to [USCIS](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-updates-policy-to-recognize-two-biological-sexes) (such as for OPT, STEM extensions, change of status, etc.), individuals will only be able to select male or female as their sex marker.


  *     * USCIS will not issue blank documents or documents with a sex other than male or female. USCIS could request additional information, such as a birth certificate, which could cause delays in adjudication.


  *     * USCIS may send a notice if they issue a document reflecting a sex different than what was put on the application.


  * The "Other" option will no longer be available when creating or updating SEVIS records for F-1 students, J-1 Exchange Visitors, or their dependents.


  *     * If an existing record lists “Other” for Gender, it must be updated to male or female if any changes are made to the Biographical Information page.


  *     * This change in SEVIS will be implemented on July 18, 2025.


Supporting our community
We understand that this binary-only approach does not reflect the lived experiences or identities of many members of our international student and scholar community. These upcoming changes may feel exclusionary, and we recognize the frustration and concern they may cause.
While federal systems may soon require records to align with passport information, this policy change does not alter our values or our commitment to inclusion, dignity, and respect. OGS is a safe and welcoming space for all our students and scholars, including those who are transgender and/or non-binary. We encourage you to share the name and pronouns you’d like us to use, and we will honor and affirm your identity in all of our interactions.
We also want to emphasize that Northeastern University policy continues to allow students to self-attest their gender (including a non-binary option) and chosen name in their university record[Office of the Registrar's website](https://service.northeastern.edu/registrar?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=76dd3a7c973f25d0beddb4221153afec&sysparm_category=07325e0197487110beddb4221153afb7).
We are actively working with campus partners and national professional networks to understand the full implications of this change and to identify the best ways to support those affected.
If you have questions or concerns about how this may impact your immigration record or experience, [we encourage you to reach out.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/contact/) Conversations will be handled privately and with care.
[Current students](https://lgbtqa.northeastern.edu/about/) and [alumni](https://lgbtqa.northeastern.edu/alumni/) are welcome to contact Northeastern’s LGBTQA Resource Center for additional support.
