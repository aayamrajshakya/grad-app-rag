The pharmacology PhD enables students to specialize in the study of the actions of drugs and their effects in living systems. In addition to the opportunity for developing a sound knowledge base through coursework and seminars, the program is designed to strengthen students’ ability to understand and evaluate critically current pharmacology literature, informing the students’ independent laboratory research that advances our understanding of drugs, their actions, and their pharmacotherapeutic applications. Recent graduates with a pharmacology PhD have found employment in academic and industrial research positions.
