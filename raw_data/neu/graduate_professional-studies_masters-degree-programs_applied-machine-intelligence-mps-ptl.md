2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Humankind is on the threshold of a new era—an age of artificial intelligence (AI) as revolutionary in its global impact as the Industrial Revolution. With the proliferation of machine learning and AI across all sectors of the global society, and fields such as financial services, healthcare, and robotics, GEOINT and cybersecurity are already changing as intelligent computers take on once-indispensably human tasks. There is an immediate need for individuals to be knowledgeable in how to manage, analyze, communicate, visualize, and lead in the area of AI by being data, technology, and human literate. The experiential AI curricula includes an introductory core, as well as an advanced core with an end-to-end AI education in the areas of finance, HR, business ventures, and healthcare/pharmaceuticals. The goal is to proactively and thoughtfully prepare students for the evolving technology and the challenges it presents. The curricula framework adopts a multidisciplinary approach to problem solving by combining computer science and analytical skills with functional government and industry expertise, creativity, and leadership with program offerings on-ground and online.
The degree program is distinguished from others by:
  * Focusing on the specific but widespread field of AI that exists within a variety of industries and applications
  * Northeastern faculty experts, who have extensive and proven experience in computer science, analytics, geospatial science, information technology, etc.
  * Courses that focus on providing critical skills in data management, data analysis, data visualization, problem solving, and advanced analytical tools, creating AI-driven decision making in fields like healthcare/pharmaceuticals, finance, HR, and business ventures
