#  BenDittbrenner
Associate Teaching Professor 
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Science 
Ben Dittbrenner is interested in exploring non-traditional approaches to promote habitat enhancement and maintenance, increase ecosystem resilience, and reduced effects of climate change on riparian systems at multiple scales. He is also interested in evaluating how disturbances such as land use conversion and climate change drive species composition and life history strategies in riparian and wetland systems. His research explores how effective beaver can be at mitigating hydrologic alteration due to climate change. Changes in flow quantity, timing, and water quality are likely to drive these dynamics, creating future stable states in communities that are difficult to anticipate and manage. He is interested in identifying these types of changes to identify strategies to bolster resilience and inform management and policy decisions. Dr. Dittbrenner teaches courses in stream ecology, wetland ecology, ecosystem management, environmental science, and sustainability.
