Travel to the nation's capital to discover how public policy affects business on every scale, from the domestic market to the global economy. You'll track policy from its creation to the ethics of its outcomes to find solutions that benefit businesses, government, and our society as a whole.
> I spent five days in Washington, D.C. for an intensive elective course and joined a cohort of MBA students from across the nation to focus on the intersection of business and government. I worked on a team project to create a new healthcare bill and developed an action plan for it to pass legislation. I built many valuable connections learning from my senior classmates.

### Frequently asked questions
How do I get to Washington, D.C.? 
Transportation isn't included in your tuition, so you'll need to arrange your own travel to and around Washington, D.C.
The most convenient airport is Ronald Reagan National (DCA)—just a short ride from the city. Baltimore-Washington (BWI) and Dulles (IAD) are also options, but they're about an hour away. If you're nearby, Amtrak or bus service to Union Station is another easy option.
For more details, check out our updated [Transportation Guide (2024)](https://washcampus.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Public-Transportation-Information-2023.pdf).
Where will I stay in Washington D.C.? 
Housing isn't included in your tuition, so you'll need to book your own accommodations for the week.
There are plenty of hotels near The Washington Campus—check out our list of nearby options. While we don't currently offer group discounts, you're also welcome to explore home or apartment rentals in the area.
Looking to share a room? For privacy reasons, The Washington Campus can't connect participants directly, but you can contact [Evelyn Gonzalez](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/people/evelyn-gonzalez/) to see if other D'Amore-McKim students are attending.
How do I access the course website? 
Once you register, you'll get a confirmation email with access to your program's course page on The Washington Campus website. This page has everything you need—logistics, syllabus, readings, agenda, group project info, speaker bios, and more. It's updated regularly, so be sure to check back before the program starts.
Didn't see the email? Check your spam or junk folder. You'll log in using the username and password provided in that message.
During the program, the faculty will also post speaker slides there (if they've given permission to share them).
How should I prepare for my course? 
You'll find a set of required readings on a course website, which will provide helpful background. Please take some time to go through them so you're ready to engage with speakers and dive into the discussions.
Look up your Members of Congress in your home district and Massachusetts. You can find your representatives in the [House of Representatives](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative) and [Senate](http://www.senate.gov/senators/index.htm).
If you're an international student—or just need a quick civics refresher—it's a good idea to review how the U.S. government works. Check out [usa.gov/branches-of-government](https://www.usa.gov/branches-of-government) for an overview of the three branches of government, and [congress.gov/legislative-process](https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process) to learn how laws are made.
What is the dress code? 
The dress code is dressy business casual—think polished but comfortable. A blazer or equivalent is recommended, but no tie is needed. Because of the places you'll visit and the people you'll meet with, jeans and flip-flops are not appropriate. 
When will I receive my grades? 
The Washington Campus will finalize grading for your exams and projects within 3 to 4 weeks after the program ends. If you're wondering when your grades will appear on your transcript, the best person to contact is [Evelyn Gonzalez](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/people/evelyn-gonzalez/).
