#  Graduate Certificate inDigital Humanities
The digital “Atlas of Southern Memory” created by Caroline Klibanoff for the DH certificate in 2018.
Each student in the certificate program will develop a project that involves some kind of substantive design or implementation component. This project should use digital methods to address a significant research question in the student’s field of study and should result in both a practical component and a written reflection. The practical component could take many different forms, including but not limited to
  * A data set or digital collection (with or without an interface)
  * A prototype or wireframe
  * A program or set of scripts or processes for accomplishing or furthering some research activity
  * A game or interactive narrative
  * A schema or specification for a data set
  * A set of data analyses and/or visualizations.


Whatever the format, the project should constitute a meaningful experiment, prototype, or component that contributes to some scholarly research objective. The final project may also be an element of a larger project such as a PhD dissertation.
Projects will be approved by the DH Certificate committee. Students should prepare three components:
  * A project “artifact,”
  * A written project description
  * A project presentation
