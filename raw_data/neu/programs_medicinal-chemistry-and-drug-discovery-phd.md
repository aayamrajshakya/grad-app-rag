## Design and synthesize novel biologically active compounds to address a broad range of social needs.
The PhD Program in Medicinal Chemistry and Drug Discovery educates and trains students in the design and synthesis of novel, biologically active compounds and in delineating their mechanisms of action using biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological approaches. 
Research specializations are available in synthetic, biochemical/pharmacological, and biophysical aspects of medicinal chemistry. 
### Faculty Research
Doctoral research in these specializations will relate to faculty areas of research, which currently include:
  * Substance use disorders and addiction
  * Neuropathic pain
  * Obesity and metabolic disorders
  * Neuropsychiatric disorders (psychoses, ADHD, depression, anxiety, eating disorders)
  * Neurodegenerative diseases


The main goal of the degree is to improve understanding of how the chemical and physical properties of drugs and their dosage forms affect therapeutic performance in healthy and diseased systems. 
Students may elect to concentrate on courses focused on novel drug delivery systems; biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics; physical pharmacy and polymeric dosage form development; or drug metabolism. 
With a strong focus on nanotechnology-based advanced delivery systems that address contemporary needs, these concentrations also give students the opportunity to study with some of the world’s top researchers. 
Students have the option of performing summer industrial internships in some of the most prestigious Boston-area pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Graduates of the program will also be well prepared to enter related PhD programs at the university.
