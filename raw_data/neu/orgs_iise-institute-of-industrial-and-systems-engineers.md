#  IISE: Institute of Industrial and Systems Engineers 
IISE Northeastern is committed to optimizing our members’ college experience by fostering an environment that promotes professional and academic development while collaborating with peers and networking with industry leaders.
We are Northeastern University’s chapter of the Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers. NU IISE gives students the chance to learn more about Industrial Engineering through different industries and encounters with professionals. We provide opportunities for students to meet and discuss current issues in IE, gain valuable leadership skills in their field, and actively participate in community service, among other things. NU IISE creates an environment where IE students can grow professionally and academically while having fun, bonding with classmates, and networking with industry professionals.
Mission: The Institute of Industrial & Systems Engineers (IISE) are the representatives of the Industrial Engineering (IE) community of Northeastern University. It is our responsibility to recruit and inform the members of our chapter of the major events occurring within the realm of IE. Each week is an informal shared learning event, wherein students of any experience can comfortably attend and learn about Industrial Engineering in a format that is atypical of the classroom structure. Through events hosted by IISE, in conjunction with our faculty and potentially other student groups, we strive to forge a deeper bond among students, faculty, and Northeastern University as a whole.
