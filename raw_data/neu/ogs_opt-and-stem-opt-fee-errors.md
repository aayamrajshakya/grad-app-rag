> As of July 25, 2025, reports indicate that fees for Pre/Post-OPT and STEM OPT now match the [fees as outlined by USCIS on their Fee Schedule.](https://www.uscis.gov/g-1055?topic_id=97312#:~:text=to%20view%20details-,I%2D765%2C%20Application%20for%20Employment%20Authorization,-Visit%20the%20I)
We have been notified by several of our international students who are filing I-765s to apply for Pre-Completion OPT (C(3)a), Post-Completion OPT (C(3)b) and the STEM OPT Extension (C(3)c) through their online USCIS accounts have been charged increased fees of $1,020 (for Pre/Post-OPT) or $745 (for STEM OPT). OGS is seeking clarification about this funding increase.
There are 3 potential options international students need to consider and decide what is right for their own unique situation:
  1. **You may decide to wait** and file your OPT/STEM OPT application until things are clearer. However, you would need to make certain that you are staying within the regulatory guidelines. 
     * **Post-OPT applications** must be filed no more than 30-days after the DSO recommends Post-OPT in SEVIS and no more than 60-days after your program end date in SEVIS.
     * **STEM OPT applications** must be filed before the expiration date of your Post-OPT EAD and no more than 60-days after the DSO recommends STEM OPT in SEVIS.
  2. **You may decide to file now** , but OGS cannot guarantee that the fee is correct or incorrect, or that you will be refunded, or that there won't be an impact to the application if you request a refund. Clarification will need to come from USCIS.
  3. **You may decide to file a paper application** with the correct fee published on the USCIS website. Please see the links below to our website on how to file either Post-OPT or the STEM OPT Extension through a paper application:
