#  DanielCuenca
Associate Teaching Professor of Spanish and Portuguese 
Dr. Cuenca specializes in modernity theory from the perspective of literary and film studies and focuses specifically on the (de-)construction of the binary fictions of “First and Third Worlds” as textual and epistemological functions of mass media. He has written extensively on Guy Debord’s theories on the society of the spectacle and is currently working on updating the French philosopher’s postulations on time-space, derive and psycho-geographies as they apply to literary theory and the study of languages and cultures.
