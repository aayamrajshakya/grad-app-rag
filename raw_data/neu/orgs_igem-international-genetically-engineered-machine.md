#  iGEM: International Genetically Engineered Machine 
iGEM is a worldwide annual competition that allows undergraduates to design and create innovative approaches for a better future through synthetic biology.
Ranging from new therapeutic techniques to coming up with solutions to biological environmental issues, iGEM provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to create pioneering research and be recognized by professional biotech companies present at the Jamboree. Students spend the whole summer working on their research, computing and analyzing the resulting data, and programming a Wiki website, mastering the skills necessary for engineers in a real workplace. The participating teams are also presented with the chance to travel for the Great Jamboree, one of the most important global synthetic biology gatherings.
