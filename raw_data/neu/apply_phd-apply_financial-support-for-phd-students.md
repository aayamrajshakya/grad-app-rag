### Computer Science and Cybersecurity students
All students admitted to the [Computer Science](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/computer-science-phd/) and [Cybersecurity](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/cybersecurity-phd/) PhD programs receive a 5-year funding package which includes: 
  * 5-year graduate assistantship, or 1-year graduate fellowship with a 4-year graduate assistantship
  * Full tuition scholarship that covers 12SH each semester for 5 years
  * Student Health Insurance Plan (cost is covered for the individual health plan)


Graduate assistants are expected to work 20 hours per week teaching or conducting research. Graduate fellows are expected to engage in research, with no teaching responsibilities.
### Cybersecurity students
#### Cyber Scholarship Program
In addition to internal funding, there are several scholarship opportunities specific to cybersecurity students. The Department of Defense runs the Cyber Scholarship Program, where selected Cyber Scholars receive full scholarships in return for one year of service to the Department of Defense upon graduation for each year or partial year the scholarship was received. During the scholarship program, you’ll receive hands-on cybersecurity training in addition to your PhD studies through internships and other learning opportunities.
