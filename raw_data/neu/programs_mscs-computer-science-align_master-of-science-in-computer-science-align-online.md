Program overview 
##  Launch your tech career 
The Align MSCS online program gives you graduate-level training so you can apply computer science in your areas of expertise-or explore an entirely new career. Through Align, you’ll build skills in the core areas of CS. Then, you’ll get to explore the junctions of CS and law, music, biology, business, physics, education, biomedical science, and more through projects as well as co-op and internship opportunities.
Full-time students complete the CS master’s for non-CS majors in 2.5-3 years. This includes a two-semester bridge of graduate-level courses to prepare students without a computer science background to study alongside those with an undergraduate degree in the field. You’ll enjoy three campus visits and an optional 4-8 months of paid computer science work experience.
