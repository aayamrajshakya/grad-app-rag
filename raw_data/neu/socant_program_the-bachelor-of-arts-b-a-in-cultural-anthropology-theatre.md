#  Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) inCultural Anthropology and Theatre
This major is designed for students who want to combine a knowledge of the art of theatre, including performance, design, and production, with sociocultural theories and conceptual frameworks for understanding human behavior. It offers both classroom and experiential learning in the practice of making theatre and performance theories with cross-cultural approaches. 
Successful students develop an understanding of theatre’s impact on past and present cultures, as well as a deeper awareness of the world in which they live.
