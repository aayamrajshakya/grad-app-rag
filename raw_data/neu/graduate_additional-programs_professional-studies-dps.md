2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Doctor of Professional Studies offers learners from diverse disciplines an opportunity to obtain the knowledge, skills, and confidence to utilize research skill sets, interdisciplinary theoretical frameworks, and a professional knowledge base to create, implement, and communicate solutions to complex problems of practice in their local, professional context.
The DPS degree program is structured to accommodate a wide range of learners from the practitioner community, including working professionals from the public and private sectors (national, state, local) and from broad and professionally diverse backgrounds. Learners explore areas such as project management and leadership, positioning them for success in higher education or in other industries where doctoral degrees are valued.
The DPS program is structured so coursework and the doctoral thesis can be completed in two to three years. Classes are delivered online with biannual Boston residencies.
For the 2025–2026 academic year, the Doctor of Professional Studies program is being offered as a collaboration between the College of Professional Studies and the Office of the Provost. During this period, students will follow Northeastern University’s Graduate Academic Calendar and be governed by the academic policies and procedures documented in the university’s [Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/ "https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/").
During the time a student is designated under the Office of the Provost, the College of Professional Studies will provide each student with full academic and student support services (e.g., academic advising services, co-op and career advising services, International Tutoring Center, etc.).
Beginning in the 2026–2027 academic year, students enrolled in the Doctor of Professional Studies program will transition to the College of Professional Studies, and their official college designation will be updated accordingly in the academic system of record. At that time, students will be governed by the academic policies and procedures documented in the university’s [Graduate Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/professional-studies/ "https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/professional-studies/"), specifically relating to the College of Professional Studies.
