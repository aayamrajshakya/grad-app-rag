[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Climate Policy and Justice](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/ppua/)
#### PPUA 5267 
Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing society and requires policy responses across scales: locally, nationally, and globally. This course discusses key climate policy approaches, including market-based and regulatory approaches, as well as intersectional approaches that address underlying drivers of climate change and inequalities in climate vulnerabilities. The course is anchored in a climate justice policy perspective, and students will become familiar with a range of frameworks and tools for climate policy design, implementation, and evaluation, with an emphasis on considering how policies can promote (or detract from) social justice. Case studies from US and international contexts will be used throughout the semester to explore policy advocacy, policy design and policy implementation in practice. In addition to considering national and sub-national climate policy, the course will cover legal, political, and economic issues in international climate negotiations and explore the history and current tensions in international climate diplomacy. 
  * ###  [Senior Capstone in International Affairs](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/social-sciences-humanities/international-affairs/#coursestext)
#### INTL 4700
Offers a senior research and writing seminar that integrates and assesses the knowledge and skills developed by students participating in the international affairs curriculum, including both experiential (co-op, Dialogue of Civilizations, study abroad, internship, or other approved international experience) and classroom-based components. Requires student self-reflection as well as new research, analysis, and writing, which culminate in a final paper and presentation. Topics include contemporary global issues and draw on relevant literature in the disciplines relating to international affairs.
