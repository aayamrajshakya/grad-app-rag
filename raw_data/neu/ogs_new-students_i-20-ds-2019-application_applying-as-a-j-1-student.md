#  Students Studying in The United States 
Exchange students and some degree-seeking students may be required to apply for a J-1 visa. If you are receiving a government scholarship or are participating in an established exchange program at Northeastern, please see the information below regarding J-1 eligibility and how to request a DS-2019 to apply for the J-1 visa. 
##  J-1 Visa Eligiblity 
In order to qualify for a J-1 visa and be eligible to request a Form DS-2019 from Northeastern University, prospective J-1 visa applicants must:
  * Be financed directly or indirectly by the U.S. government, the government of their home country, an international organization of which the United States is a member by treaty or statute, or supported substantially by funding from any source other than personal or family funds (greater than 50% of your funding must be from non-personal or family sources
  * Participate in a program that has an agreement between the U.S. government and a foreign government, or according to a written agreement between Northeastern and foreign educational institutions, Northeastern and a foreign government or a state or local government in the United States and a foreign government.
  * Be able to demonstrate the required amount of funding for the entire duration of your program


##  Requesting a DS-2019 
What is a Form DS-2019?
The Form DS-2019 is a Certificate of Eligibility issued to prospective non-immigrant exchange students by a program sponsor (Northeastern University) so that they may apply for a J-1 visa at U.S. Embassy or Consulate Abroad.
Accessing the DS-2019 Request e-form
If your source of funding for your degree program requires you to apply for a J-1 visa (such as a government scholarship) or you believe you otherwise qualify to apply for a J-1 visa for your degree program, please notify your Northeastern Admissions Office, who will contact OGS. If it is determined you are eligible to apply for the J-1 visa, OGS will directly email you instructions to submit a DS-2019 request.
For incoming exchange students admitted to an exchange program through the [Global Experience Office (GEO)](https://geo.northeastern.edu/programs/incoming-exchange-program/), you will directly receive a link to request a DS-2019 from GEO after you are admitted to the exchange program.
For all other non-degree exchange programs at Northeastern, your admissions contact will provide you with a link to request the DS-2019 after your admission.
##  Required Financial Documents 
When requesting a Form DS-2019 from Northeastern, you will be required to provide funding documentation that [meets specific requirements](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/financial-requirements/), and demonstrates that you have sufficient funding for the entire duration of your program at Northeastern[here](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/estimate-of-expenses-for-i-20-requests/) for degree-seeking students.
If you have a sponsor who will support you financially (this can even be a family member), then you must attach a letter of support, in English, from your sponsor. Please view this [sample letter](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/affidavit-of-support-example/).
##  Proof of English Language Proficiency 
U.S. Department of State regulations [[22 C.F.R. §62.10(a)(2)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-22/chapter-I/subchapter-G/part-62#p-62.10\(a\)\(2\))] require that J-1 Exchange Visitors (EVs) are proficient in English to successfully carry out their J-1 program activities and function in the U.S. on a day-to-day basis. A program sponsor must verify aprospective EV’s English language proficiencyprior to issuing a Form DS-2019 through an objective measurement.
As part of your admission to a degree or exchange program at Northeastern, you will be required to provide documentation of your English Language Proficiency, which will also meet the requirements for being issued a Form DS-2019.
##  Health Insurance Requirements 
U.S. government regulations [22 CFR § 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements:
  * Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
  * Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000
  * Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000
  * A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness
  * Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period
  * Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs)
  * Continuous coverage for the duration of the program


To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following:
  * A.M. Best rating of A- or above

  * Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of ‘‘A-’’ or above

If you purchased health insurance in your home country or have insurance from your home institution or home government, please ensure that it covers all of the J-1 requirements listed above and covers you and any J-2 dependents during your entire period of time in the U.S.
The Department of State requires the Office of Global Services (OGS) to confirm that all J-1 students and exchange students have health insurance that complies with the federal regulations. OGS reserves the right to request proof of health insurance at any time during the J-1 student’s program.
The following vendor has created a health insurance plan specifically for Northeastern J-1 visitors that meets all of the J-1 visa requirements: [Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk.](http://www.gallagherstudent.com/iss)
#### _Please note that willful failure to have and maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 visa requirements is a violation of your J-1 status that will result in termination of your SEVIS record and ending your J-1 program early._
