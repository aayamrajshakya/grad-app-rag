The [Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-2/part-200) (Uniform Guidance) were released on December 26, 2013.
The Uniform Guidance streamlines and supersedes guidance that was previously contained in eight different OMB Circulars, including A-110, A-21, and A-133. The new guidance consists of definitions, uniform administrative requirements (both pre- and post-award), cost principles, and audit requirements.
The Uniform Guidance (UG) applies to all new federal awards issued on or after December 26, 2014. Modifications adding new or incremental funding to awards issued prior to that date may also include a clause updating the terms of the award to fall under the new Uniform Guidance.
Federal agencies are developing agency-specific implementation plans for the Uniform Guidance. Some agencies adopt the Uniform Guidance in its entirety, while others list specific exceptions. It is necessary to review the Uniform Guidance, the sponsoring agency’s implementation plan and the terms in the Notice of Award to determine which rules will apply to any new or incremental federal funding.
As Northeastern University revises internal guidelines and policies in response to the Uniform Guidance, updates will be communicated to the research community.
