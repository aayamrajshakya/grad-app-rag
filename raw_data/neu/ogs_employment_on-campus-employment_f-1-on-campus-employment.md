#  Students Studying in The United States 
One of the benefits of the F-1 and J-1 student visa types is eligibility for on-campus employment. There are specific requirements and restrictions for on-campus employment, however, so please be sure to carefully review this page before engaging in on-campus employment. 
##  Overview of On-Campus Employment 
F-1 students enrolled in degree-seeking programs and J-1 degree-seeking and exchange students at Northeastern University are eligible to work on-campus while attending classes. The work does not need to be related to the student’s field of study. Students must maintain lawful F-1 or J-1 status while engaging in on-campus employment.
On-campus employment includes:
  * Working for Northeastern University in the library, laboratories, residential buildings, administrative offices, or doing research on-campus
  * Employment with Northeastern based on a fellowship, assistantship, or grant (such as a teaching or research assistantship) 
    * [Learn more about Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGAs) here](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/on-campus-employment/stipended-graduate-assistantships/)
  * Employment with approved on-location commercial firms which provide services for students on campus, such as restaurants located in a University-owned building 
    * A list of approved on-location commercial firms is listed below under “Approved On-Campus Employers”


**When listing this employment experience on resumes, CVs, LinkedIn, or other professional documents, be sure to describe it accurately as on-campus employment. This will help reduce confusion during future visa applications or applications to USCIS.**
If you have questions about if something counts as “on-campus” please review the list of eligible on-campus employers below or reach out to OGS directly.
NOTE: J-1 students whose J-1 program sponsor is Fulbright or another organization other than Northeastern will need to request on-campus work permission (and any necessary authorization letters to apply for an SSN) from their J-1 program sponsor.
