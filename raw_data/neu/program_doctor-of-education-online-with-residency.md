Northeastern's Doctor of Education program is designed for experienced professionals interested in deepening their understanding of learning and education to become the next generation of leaders driving educational change.
With experiential learning opportunities, supportive faculty practitioners, and the collaboration between a diverse group of fellow professionals and alumni you'll gain a practical education that translates into driving positive change in your everyday working environment.
Designed to be completed in three to four years of study—the program's dissertation in practice process will begin at the onset of your coursework as you identify your problem of practice, learn and hone your research skills, and develop and implement an action plan to positively impact your learning context—culminating in the dissemination of your action research findings.
The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate selected Northeastern's EdD program as the 2022-2023 Program of the Year, noting the “redesigned Dissertation in Practice Curriculum and the adoption of action research as its guiding methodology …” The committee praised “the program’s efforts to move beyond the typical five-chapter dissertation and engage scholarly practitioners in the acquisition of skills to realize meaningful change in their local contexts, emphasizing social justice.”
While all EdD courses can be completed online (with optional hybrid courses in Seattle), annual in-person two-day residencies are held on campus. Residencies focus on networking and tools for career success and allow you to connect with faculty and fellow scholars to share knowledge and experience.
The Northeastern Doctor of Education degree is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).
Note: Currently students in our EdD are not supported when pursuing licensure for Superintendent. We will certify what courses they took, but we also must make explicit that these courses are not for licensure.

### The EdD Residency
As part of the requirement to complete your EdD degree program, you must attend at least two residences over the program. You'll attend residencies in your first and second years of the program at one of our campuses.
Residencies are conference-type experiences where you attend workshops and other sessions presented by faculty, staff, alumni and other students. Each session is designed to support the learning needs of EdD students, highlight emerging research, and provide strategic networking opportunities.
Residences are held across Northeastern’s global campus system multiple times per year.
