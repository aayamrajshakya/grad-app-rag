#  IDEA Student-Led Venture Accelerator 
IDEA is a student-led venture accelerator at Northeastern University that supports entrepreneurs by providing services for every stage of venture development, from business plan creation to prototype funding.
At D'Amore-McKim, we empower you to be bold and fearless and to think like an entrepreneur. Collaborate with IDEA, Northeastern's unique student-led venture accelerator, to launch and grow your startup. By working with IDEA, you'll enhance your entrepreneurial skills, connect with a vibrant network of innovators, and receive support to pitch, develop, and launch your business.
Also, if you're a graduate student or professional who would like to coach startups, IDEA may be able to connect you with entrepreneurs who need support in your area of expertise. It's a great way to share your time and talents—and possibly create a positive impact on the community around you. You will gain:
  * Real-world leadership and entrepreneurial experience
  * Skills in problem validation, business modeling, pitching, and go-to-market strategy

You'll walk away understanding how to take an idea from concept to launch, with confidence built through execution and learning from failure. Expect to be challenged, supported, and part of a collaborative and inclusive community. 
> As a first-time entrepreneur, IDEA offered some incredibly valuable, hands-on, and straightforward tools to help me think about modeling a business for success. I received tremendous value, from pitch practice to understanding the lifetime value of a customer. I highly recommend IDEA to anyone in the Northeastern network who wants to launch a venture.

That means they are proving themselves to a board of funders from IDEA, and they are capable of moving forward and growing. IDEA has been one of the coolest things I've been able to be a part of here.
