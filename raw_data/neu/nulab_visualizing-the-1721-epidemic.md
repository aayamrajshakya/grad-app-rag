# Visualizing the 1721 Epidemic
**Partially Supported by a NULab Seedling Grant**
Exactly 400 years ago, Boston suffered one of the worst outbreaks of what had, by then, become a familiar disease that struck the city every few decades. As smallpox stalked the streets of Boston, the social fabric of the city wore thin. Advocates for aggressive interventions to halt the spread of the epidemic met fierce resistance from those who thought the disease would pass on its own; between the summer of 1721 and the spring of 1722, intellectual disputes about the nature and course of the outbreak frequently turned violent, while, around the city, over 800 residents (of around 10,000) fell sick and died.
