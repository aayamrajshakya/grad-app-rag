GRE General Exam – Optional
Test scores may be helpful for applicants with little or no experience beyond the undergraduate degree.
An applicant can upload an unofficial copy of GRE General Exam scores to the online application. If admitted, official scores will be required and are to be sent through ETS (institution code 3682).
Non-Degree, Part-Time Special Students
CSSH offers a part-time, non-degree student classification called Special Student. Applicants for special student classification use the same online application system that degree and certificate applicants use. Special student admissions deadlines and materials are listed on this page.
Special students may enroll in CSSH graduate courses on a part-time basis (no more than 4 semester hours per semester). Special students may earn up to 12 semester hours over time.
After completing 12 semester hours, a special student who wants to continue in graduate coursework should apply to a degree or certificate program. See the Academic Catalog for more information about [student classifications](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/social-sciences-humanities/general-regulations/general-information/).
