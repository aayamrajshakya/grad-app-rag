## This concentration is ideal for
MBA students interested in the life sciences, biotechnology, or pharmaceutical industries
Emerging leaders interested in jobs like biotech consultant or bioinformatics specialist
Students looking to build an advanced toolset at the intersection of big data and biology
## Use big data to advance biology and technology 
In a world where the fusion of biology, technology, and data is creating tremendous change, there are limitless opportunities for emerging business leaders in the life sciences, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical industries. In the Bioinformatics concentration—offered through a partnership with [Northeastern's College of Science](https://cos.northeastern.edu/)—you'll apply the analytical principles of big data to bioinformatics projects. 
Under the instruction of College of Science professors, you'll build your programming skills in Python and R, and gain experience with the latest computational methods and key DevOps concepts like version control and Linux. You'll apply these skills as you dive into genomics and learn to analyze large amounts of genetic data with bioinformatics tools. 
You don't need a background in life sciences for this concentration. Our faculty is excited to welcome anyone looking to boost their career with some biological science knowledge.
