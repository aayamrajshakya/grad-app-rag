#  JackGreene
Professor Emeritus of Criminology and Criminal Justice 
Jack R. Greene is recognized as one of the country’s leading scholars in the field of policing. Greene has published six books, a two-volume Encyclopedia of Police Science, and over 100 research articles, book chapters, research reports and policy papers on matters of policing in the U.S. and internationally. He co-edited, Criminologists on Terrorism (Cambridge University Press) with Brian Forst and James Lynch (2011).
He has consulted for various agencies and organizations, including the Philadelphia and Los Angeles Police Departments, the Justice Department, the National Institute of Justice, the Urban Institute and the Rand Corp, and currently serves on the research advisory committees of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Police Foundation. Dr. Greene is a fellow of the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences, and has been a consultant to major police and governmental agencies throughout his career. For nine years, he was a commissioner on the Commission for the Accreditation of Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA).
Dr. Greene has written widely on matters of police service delivery, community approaches to policing, crime prevention and police management. More recently he shifted his research focus from community-oriented approaches to crime prevention and law enforcement, to the strategic and practical problems the police encounter in community building, preserving human rights and in taking on a new security role in an era of terrorism. He now writes on terrorism, human rights and the social and legal complexity of police interventions.
