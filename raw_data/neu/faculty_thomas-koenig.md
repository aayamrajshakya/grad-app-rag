  * ### Law and Society in a Digital World
#### SOCL 4518
Explores the ways in which the legal system shapes and is, in turn, shaped by ideological and political movements. For example, the bitter controversy over whether runaway juries have created “jackpot justice” by awarding huge sums to plaintiffs is a reflection of deep cultural and political divides over individual rights and corporate power. Also examines new legal principles that are currently evolving to deal with such misdeeds as systematic corporate misconduct, cyber crimes, and harassment. 


### Computers and Society
#### SOCL 4528
Focuses on the social and political context of technological change and development. Through readings, course assignments, and class discussions, offers students an opportunity to learn to analyze the ways that the internet, artificial intelligence, and other technological advances have required a reworking of every human institution—both to facilitate the development of these technologies and in response to their adoption.
