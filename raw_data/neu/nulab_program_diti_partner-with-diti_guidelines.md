#  Digital IntegrationTeaching Initiative
A presentation on [Our Marathon](https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/) for an Advanced Writing in the Disciplines course
At the core of the Digital Integration Teaching Initiative model is an ethos of collaboration: we aim to help CSSH faculty integrate digital proficiencies into the curriculum of their courses. This integrative model takes time, careful planning, and collaborative work on the part of faculty members and the DITI team.
Most DITI modules are taught by our team of graduate student Fellows, who have a broad range of expertises in digital methods, tools, and pedagogies. We at the DITI believe that our partnerships should be learning experiences for all those involved, including not just the students in the classes that we visit, but also our faculty partners and our own graduate student team. We see DITI collaborations as a chance for our Fellows to gain valuable experience in teaching for different contexts, and for our faculty partners to learn new skills and effective approaches to introducing technical subjects in humanities and social science courses. We frame all our partnerships as collaborations among experts, with the extensive pedagogical and technical expertises of DITI Fellows complementing expert faculty knowledge to expand the skills and proficiencies of CSSH students.
Our goal is for faculty partners to work closely with the DITI team so that in the future they will be able to teach the modules themselves, but DITI team members can remain available for assistance and ongoing planning.

## Partnership Roles
To ensure that partnerships are successful, we have set out a few guidelines. Faculty members should plan to:
  * Reserve time that works best for both the course and the DITI team members’ schedules; without sufficient lead time, we may not be able to accommodate a specific date.
  * Distribute the appropriate materials, arrange downloads of data/software, and send advance instructions to students so they are well-prepared for the class as needed.
  * Attend the class during workshop days. This helps faculty partners learn the material themselves, and address any course-specific questions from students as they arise.

## Types of Partnerships
We offer several types of partnerships between faculty and DITI Fellows to incorporate computational and digital skills into existing course content:
### Types of Partnerships
One-day or Several-day Workshop
DITI team members will visit the class on one or more days to teach a workshop on digital or computational skills. Workshops can either present new content—created in collaboration with the faculty partner—or be adapted from existing materials. Developing new workshop materials will require additional time. Visit our [example materials page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/modules/samples/) to explore some previous workshops.
Multi-class Assignment
DITI team members will work one-on-one with the faculty partner to develop an assignment that incorporates digital or computational skills. Usually, this involves adding a digital component to an existing assignment (e.g. mapping, text analysis, visualizations), but developing a new assignment is also a possibility. Visit our [example materials page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/modules/samples/) to explore some multi-class assignments.
Semester-long Assignment
This partnership involves a more in-depth assignment that spans the course semester and may involve multiple digital proficiencies. This sustained assignment will help students become more proficient with a particular digital or computational skill and apply it to a long-term project. DITI team members will work with the faculty partner throughout the semester.
We are also able to accommodate other types of partnerships with sufficient advance notice. Please note that some partnerships will take longer than others to develop, especially if the content is new. For all partnerships, however, both the class date and type of partnership must be specified before the semester begins

## Partnership Timeline
To ensure that we are able to accommodate all requests, we have established a timeline for DITI partnerships. Partnerships begin early in the semester before
When you have completed the CFP intake form, the DITI team will reach out to schedule a planning consultation. We will also send information on how you can reserve a week or weeks for a class visit. We can only successfully teach a limited number of class visits per week, and weekly reservations are done on a first-come first-served basis. Note that some weeks are historically more popular than others, particularly during the beginning and middle of the semester. We will make every effort to accommodate your schedule, but we may not be able to offer a visit during your desired week(s) if you are unable to meet with us or confirm the timing and logistics of your visit.
Please note that the DITI typically brings on a new cohort of Fellows at the start of the summer and we often add new team members in the fall. This means that our faculty partners may work with different DITI Fellows over the course of a partnership, and that the DITI team will bring different levels of previous experience to the very wide range of materials we teach. We strive to ensure consistency across all our partnerships, but we also ask faculty partners to remember that DITI Fellowships are a learning opportunity for our graduate students. 
### Partnership Timeline
Timeline for Fall and Summer Semesters
  * _By March 27_ : let us know if you are interested in a DITI partnership for the Fall by filling out this brief [survey](http://bit.ly/dti-CFPartnerships). You do not need to know full details about your course to submit the form. The DITI team will typically open the survey by mid February.
  * _By May 31_ : an in-person or virtual meeting will be held to collect course details and plan for the partnership. A specific date or course syllabus is not needed at this time, but the initial meeting will serve as the foundation for determining which types of partnerships best suit the class goals, creating a timeline, and clarifying expectations for what can be taught during the given timeframe.
  * If there is availability, the DITI team will circulate a second call for fall partnerships in June. These partnerships will usually be restricted to existing materials. Faculty requesting customized modules should respond by the March deadline.


Timeline for Spring Semesters
  * _By November 1_: let us know if you are interested in a DITI partnership for the Spring by filling out this brief [survey](http://bit.ly/dti-CFPartnerships). You do not need to know full details about your course to submit the form. The DITI team will typically open the survey by early October.
  * _By December 13_ : an in-person or virtual meeting will be held to collect course details and plan for the partnership. A specific date or course syllabus is not needed at this time, but the initial meeting will serve as the foundation for determining which types of partnerships best suit the class goals, creating a timeline, and clarifying expectations for what can be taught during the given timeframe.


## Data Considerations
We recommend that faculty partners select data for workshops, projects, and presentations during advance planning for the module. Faculty partners should plan to provide or point to datasets that are relevant to the course and to consult with DITI team members on what kinds of data are needed for different assignments or workshops. In some cases, the DITI team may be able to assist with data gathering. See the [DITI’s resources on data considerations](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/partner-with-diti/data-considerations/) for more information.
