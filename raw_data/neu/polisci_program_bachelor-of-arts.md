#  Bachelor of ArtsPolitical Science
In designing an undergraduate program, students have two different degree options: Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Science (BS). In comparing the two degrees, the BA includes a smaller number of political science electives – six instead of eight—and a foreign language requirement, in addition to the Northeastern University Core. Students are encouraged to talk to an advisor about which degree best fits their academic goals.
The Bachelor of Arts in Political Science provides a set of introductory courses to the discipline, followed by methodology courses, electives, and a capstone course. Students explore and analyze the many facets of American government, comparative politics, international relations, and political philosophy. With elective courses, students may choose from among a number of concentrations or follow their own curricular path. At the college level, the Bachelor of Arts in Political Science includes a foreign language requirement. 
The Department of Political Science in addition to the Bachelor of Arts in Political Science also offers combined majors in cooperation with other departments and programs on campus. Unlike a double major, in which a student completes all of the requirements of two majors, a combined major involves a shorter set of course requirements agreed upon by two different departments or programs.
