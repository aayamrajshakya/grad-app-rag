At the intersection of microscopic organisms and climate policy is the scholarly work of Stephanie Tsui, a PhD candidate in Marine and Environmental Sciences. Tsui’s fascination with ecosystems began as an undergraduate at the University of California, Davis. Her early research experiences took her across Northern California, where she studied soil microorganisms, measured nutrient cycling in agricultural fields, and investigated how changes in ocean water density and temperature affect the way crabs transport their larvae. These projects helped Tsui develop a deep appreciation for the microorganisms that drive essential ecological cycles and the ever-evolving water systems that impact them. Passion for this intersection of microorganisms and “dynamic hydrology,” as study of these water systems are called, led her to find Dr. Jennifer Bowen at Northeastern. Now Tsui is part of the Bowen Lab, where her team researches the critical roles that microbes play in salt marshes, with the findings having implications for climate change policy. Tsui’s PhD research reflects her belief that tackling environmental challenges requires both a scientific and social understanding of the problems and solutions. 
Her first project, funded by the National Science Foundation, has exemplified collaborative science at its best. Collaborating with researchers at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, and the University of South Carolina in Georgetown, SC, Tsui is investigating how different forms of nitrogen (ammonium and nitrate) influence sediment microbial communities in salt marshes. Her research addresses fundamental questions about changing ecosystems in an era of climate change. As climate patterns shift, understanding how these changes affect the microscopic communities that drive ecosystem processes becomes even more crucial for managing coastal health.
Tsui’s second research stream takes an unexpected turn into the study of human psychology and perception. Through hundreds of surveys filled out by undergraduate students along the Eastern and Gulf coasts, she’s exploring how one’s cultural upbringing and education can change the way young people value human-nature relationships. Her work recognizes that environmental protection ultimately depends on human decision-making. 
Her third area of study directly tackles the implementation challenges facing coastal restoration. Collaborating with scientists at The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries, she’s investigating social factors limiting habitat restoration. This work moves beyond identifying what needs to be restored to filling in the gaps in our understanding of why restoration efforts face obstacles on-the-ground. By examining policy frameworks, community attitudes, and institutional barriers, Tsui’s research aims to build a bridge between scientific policy recommendations and the reality of implementation practices.
**Global Relevance, Local Impact**
When asked about the broader significance of her research, Tsui framed her work within the urgent realities of climate change, “Humans are not immune to climate change. We rely on coastlines for food, land, flood protection, carbon and nutrient cycling, economics, recreation, and much more. Losing these ecosystems will have drastic consequences.” She stressed that human actions and climate change threaten coastal areas through habitat loss and degradation, nutrient pollution, rising temperatures, and sea-level rise. In addition to this, her research goes beyond environmental science to encompass its interconnectedness with humans. One of the most rewarding aspects of Tsui’s PhD experience has been the expansion of her professional network through the collaborative research she has undertaken. This collaborative approach reflects Northeastern’s interdisciplinary culture, where research crosses traditional departmental boundaries, “You’d be surprised by how many collaborations happen between departments!” 
**Life Beyond Research**
Like many doctoral students, Tsui acknowledges that her PhD journey hasn’t followed a linear path, “There are times where I’ve felt like an imposter, but looking back, I’ve seen a lot of personal growth from when I began.” Her experience highlights the importance of support in doctoral programs, as she highlighted, “I’m truly grateful for the support from my friends within my department. I’ve learned a lot from my peers and mentors.” Tsui’s career goals reflect her integrated approach to environmental science and policy; She hopes to work for an institution focused on using applied research and a social-ecological lens to advocate for and inform climate change policy on coastal habitat restoration. Her vision represents the kind of career that bridges academic research with real-world implementation by using scientific knowledge to improve environmental protection.
For Tsui, the future of coastal ecosystems lies in understanding both the microscopic processes that sustain these environments and the human factors that determine how we’ll take action to preserve them. Her research represents a new generation of environmental scientists who recognize that saving the planet requires expertise in both natural sciences and social systems. By combining microbial ecology with human perception studies and policy analysis, Tsui will be ready to tackle environmental challenges with the comprehensive, interdisciplinary approaches they demand.
