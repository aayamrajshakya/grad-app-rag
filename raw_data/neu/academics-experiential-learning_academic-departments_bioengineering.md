#### World-Renown Co-op Program
Ella Strzegowski, BS, bioengineering, embarked on a co-op at Moderna just as the company was applying for its biologics license and COVID-19’s Omicron variant was tearing through the population. Her experience placed her at the epicenter of Covid-related research even as the virus—and the world’s response to it—changed by the day.

#### World-Renowned Cooperative Education
Aanie Phillips, BS, bioengineering, says co-op puts into perspective what you learn in the classroom providing an immersive learning experience. She did two co-ops, a clinical one at a doctor’s office, and the other as a mechanical and operations engineer at Virtudent, a teledentistry startup. Aaanie is off to medical school with a full scholarship from her top-choice school.
