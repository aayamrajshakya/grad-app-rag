Program overview 
##  An integrated approach to economics 
Globalization has created a borderless economy with a host of new opportunities and challenges for those engaged in commerce and economic development. While global markets offer exciting growth prospects, navigating the world stage requires in-depth knowledge of the financial, regulatory, and economic environments and institutions that affect the global economy and international trade. To meet the need for both insight and skills development, Northeastern University’s College of Professional Studies—in collaboration with Northeastern University’s College of Social Sciences and Humanities—offers the Master of Science in Commerce and Economic Development, which integrates an applied economics study of information, institutions, and innovation to develop and hone analytical skills.
