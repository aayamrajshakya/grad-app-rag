#  NGSEA: Northeastern Graduate Structural Engineering Association, ASCE Structural Engineering Institute NU Student Chapter 
NGSEA is a group for graduate students of all majors who are interested in structural engineering.
NGSEA is a group for graduate students of all majors who are interested in structural engineering. We host a number of seminars each semester where industry professionals, academics, and students can share their work and network with their peers. Additionally, we host additional events including construction site visits, networking events with other graduate student groups, and casual get-togethers for students to get to know each other and build a sense of community within the graduate structural engineering program.
The purpose of the NGSEA shall be to:
  * Actively seek and promote the improvement of the quality of graduate student life, academic affairs and research within structural engineering at the College of Engineering for both full-time and part-time students.
  * Promote the dissemination and discussion of structural engineering research at Northeastern University as well as promoting interest in structural engineering projects and research amongst all graduate students at Northeastern University.
  * Provide a forum for networking amongst graduate students, faculty, and professionals.
  * Take an active role in promoting contacts from alumni and professional industry groups.
