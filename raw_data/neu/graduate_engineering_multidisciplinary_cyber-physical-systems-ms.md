2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The [Master of Science in Cyber-Physical Systems](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/academic-departments/mgen/ms-cyps/) with a concentration in the Internet of Things is designed to prepare our graduates for a world of connected devices. This innovative multidisciplinary program is designed to meet the demand for a new kind of specialist—one who can engineer and develop new interactive services; acquire, fuse, and process the data collected from sensors, actuators, controllers, and other devices; and develop architectures to interconnect these elements as part of larger, more diverse systems. It is expected that careers in this rapidly evolving area will encompass industry sectors ranging from energy, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure to manufacturing.
This program integrates the study of wireless networking, protocols, sensor networks, security, software development, embedded systems, data analytics, and Big Data to provide students with the knowledge and tools to develop IoT applications, to analyze and design IoT architectures for different application domains, and to develop data analytic tools to analyze the large amounts of data generated by the massive deployment of IoT devices.
## Degree Requirements 
Students in the program must complete 32 semester hours of approved coursework with a minimum grade-point average of 3.000. Students can complete a master's degree by pursuing any one of the three options: coursework option, project option, and thesis option. Specific degree requirements for each of these options can be found under the Program Requirements tab. Although there are some dependencies among the core courses, the program may be started in either the fall or spring semester. 
Master's Project and Thesis options must be carried out under the supervision of a professor and must have prior approval of the program director. Proposals for a Master's Project or a Thesis need to be submitted at least one month before the start of the semester.
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
