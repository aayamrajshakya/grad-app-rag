2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Today’s cross-functional teams and organizations require a leadership style that capitalizes on the collective expertise and capabilities of the group. The development and mastery of collaborative leadership skills are not typically part of one’s focused discipline preparation; hence, leadership requires deliberate development by those who assume leadership roles.
The Graduate Certificate in Leadership starts with the premise that everyone is capable of leadership. The program studies every aspect of leadership dynamics from the leader as an individual to working in teams and from the organization itself to the development of strategic leadership techniques. Course work exposes participants to a series of alternative perspectives of leadership, including collaborative models. Using the course’s action-learning methods, participants build a personal model of leadership that they can put to immediate use in their workplace.
