# Scholarship Opportunities for Master’s Students
## Khoury College Scholarships
The scholarships listed below are awarded by Khoury College to students who meet the eligibility criteria.
### Align Scholars Program 
Students admitted to an Align program at Khoury College must complete the scholarship question on the admissions application to be considered for our Align Scholars program. Students are notified of awards by the first day of the semester. Align Scholars are selected on a semester-by-semester basis; students who defer their start date will lose their scholarship and need to reapply to be considered again. Available scholarships are limited and will be considered case by case.
Align Scholars eligibility requirements:
  * Incoming student to any Khoury Align program
  * Domestic student (US citizen or permanent resident)
  * Students who identify as underrepresented in technology and those with high financial need (verified by FAFSA) will be prioritized
  * Must maintain a 3.0 GPA and remain in good academic standing while in the Align program


### Additional scholarship opportunities
Khoury College may occasionally receive scholarship funding from private donors, who often set the criteria for the recipients of the funds. Generally, there is no application required for this funding. Students who meet the criteria for these awards will be notified before the start of the semester.
