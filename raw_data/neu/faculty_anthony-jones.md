Associate Professor Emeritus of Sociology and International Affairs 
Anthony Jones received his undergraduate education in England before coming to the USA to do an MA at Brown and a PhD at Princeton. He has spent most of his professional life doing research on the Soviet Union and Russia, but in recent years has extended his focus to include Europe and the Mediterranean region.
His current research interests focus on issues of long-term global change and how nations and populations respond to change. He is working on a book that looks at this issue in the Mediterranean region, focusing on how countries are influenced by their “neighbors” in the region; at the forces of continuity and change in political, social, economic, and cultural life; at the ways in which security and development are influenced by regional conditions; at attempts to create regional integration; and at the environmental and population problems that affect all of the Mediterranean nations.
He is also interested in the theoretical issues of continuity and change as they relate to the notion of “neighborhood effects”, looking at how events and trends in one nation can spill over into neighboring nations. Jones is also interested in the current debate on the causes and consequences of a shift in world power from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and in how Europe and North America might adapt to this shift.
Jones is vice president and executive director of the Gorbachev Foundation of North America and is a co-founder of the Club of Madrid, serving on its Board of Directors. He has been a visiting professor at the Université de Paris I (Panthéon-Sorbonne), is a visiting researcher at the University of Versailles, a Membre d’Honneur of the Center for Mediterranean Studies at the University of Nice, an occasional speaker at the Mediterranean Academy of Diplomatic Studies in Malta, and an affiliate of the Center for European Studies at Harvard.
