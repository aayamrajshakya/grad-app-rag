## About the program
Prepare for a career on the frontier of data analytics, with the online Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering (DAE) program from the College of Engineering at Northeastern University.
Whether you’re an experienced engineer or brand-new to data analytics, this program will immerse you in specializations such as data visualization, database design and data mining, giving you the skills to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.
Once you’ve mastered essential data analytics techniques such as data normalization and data mapping, and become proficient in multiple programming languages such as R, SQL and Python, you’ll be ready to take on roles like predictive modeling analyst, advanced software engineer, data integration engineer and more, to help shape the evolution of data as a transformative force in modern society.
Designed with 100% online flexibility for working professionals.

## Skip the application—let your performance pave the way
With the DAE program’s [Fast App pathway](https://online.northeastern.edu/degrees/fast-app/), you can skip the application process and use your performance on two initial courses to secure your place in the DAE program.
Complete two performance-based courses from the DAE program, get a ‘B’ grade or better, show proof of your bachelor's degree by the time you complete the two courses, and you’ll join the next cohort in the full master’s degree program. All credits earned in the DAE performance-based courses apply directly to the DAE degree program.

### How to prepare
Although there aren't any prerequisites for the DAE Fast App Performance-Based pathway, you'll need to be familiar with Python Programming Proficiency, Fundamentals of Probability Theory, and Linear Algebra in order to succeed in the DAE performance-based courses.
We recommend reviewing the following preparatory courses to fill in any gaps in skills and knowledge before enrolling in the DAE performance-based courses. This series of courses has been hand chosen by College of Engineering faculty and is designed to equip you with skills and knowledge to enhance your success in the PBA pathway courses.
  * [Crash Course on Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-crash-course)
  * [Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-linear-algebra)
  * [Probability & Statistics for Machine Learning and Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-probability-and-statistics?specialization=mathematics-for-machine-learning-and-data-science)


You can also apply to the program using the standard graduate application for direct admission consideration.
