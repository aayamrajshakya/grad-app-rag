## How to find the best co-op for you
Yes, getting your dream co-op is competitive.  
But we’ve got you throughout the process.
Meet your co-op coordinator
  * Connect with co-op peers and mentors at welcome events, orientations, and co-op info sessions throughout your first year. 


  * Identify first-year experiences—clubs, research, summer internships—to build out your resume. 


Enroll in our co-op prep course 
  * A one-time course that meets weekly throughout the first semester of your second year, taught by a co-op coordinator.


  * You’ll explore career paths, get your resume and cover letter reviewed, practice interviewing, learn job search strategies, and more.


  * Graduate students can use this course to refine their CV and brush up on interviewing skills.


1:1 advising 
  * We’ll help you define—and redefine—your career aspirations and connect you to resources.
  * What’s a video game designer vs. a game developer? Small life sciences startup or global pharmaceutical company? For graduate students, what’s the best option for switching careers? We help demystify it all.


Search and apply 
  * Apply for your first co-op during your second year (same for graduate students doing just one co-op) using our online job search platform, NUWorks. Co-op cycles begin in either January or July.


  * Dive into all the employer recruitment events and career workshops we offer.


  * Respond to and schedule interviews promptly and professionally. Then prep and practice interviewing—with your coordinator, a mentor, your roommate, your partner…


  * Apply for any co-op, regardless of major or college, as long as you meet the job qualifications. Explore widely and keep your options open.


Accept an offer 
  * When you receive responses, work closely with your co-op coordinator to navigate and negotiate offers. You should acknowledge all offers within 48 hours.


  * Once you accept a position, you’re committed. Connect with your employer to confirm start and end dates, and work schedule. 


  * Work with Northeastern to arrange logistics around transportation or housing if you’re moving to a new city or country.


  * International students should confirm visa requirements.


During your co-op
  * Once the position is confirmed, work with your co-op coordinator to establish learning goals and objectives. Review those with your work supervisor. 


  * You’ll have a mid-point check-in with your coordinator, as well as regular meetings with your supervisors and mentors on the job. 


  * You must complete three reflective writing prompts at regular intervals throughout your co-op.


Final performance assessment 
  * Your employer will submit a final assessment of your performance. You’ll also complete a self-assessment.


  * Review the assessments with your coordinator against the goals and objectives you set at the start.


  * Your grade—satisfactory or unsatisfactory—will be based on assessments and reflections.


  * Undergraduates: when you’re ready for your second co-op, you’ll skip straight to 1:1 advising and finish again with the assessments.
