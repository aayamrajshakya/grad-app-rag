## Data Analytics
### Predicting College Success through Online Engagement
Course: Integrated Experiential Learning For Analytics
Instructor: Umesh Hodeghatta
Nearpeer, a web platform and mobile app, partners with colleges to improve student belonging and enrollment. They tasked students with identifying behaviors predictive of college success. XN students analyzed 65,000+ data points using predictive analytics, logistic regression, and statistical modeling. They hypothesized that students committed to Nearpeer but with low engagement (e.g., few chats, sessions, or group posts) are likelier to drop out before the census. Nearpeer aims to use this data to identify at-risk students early, enabling timely interventions by their organization and college partners to improve retention and success rates.

## **Bioengineering**
### Universal Socket for Myocontrol in Upper Limb Amputees
Course: Bioengineering Capstone Design
Instructor: Helen Markewich
Prosthetics is an evolving industry expanding into new fields of technology and medicine constantly. Some of the most promising research in prosthetics is the use of surface electrodes and pattern recognition software to control upper limb prosthetics in an intuitive way, known as myocontrol. In this project, students were challenged by the Regenstein Foundation Center for Bionic Medicine at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab to design and create an open-source fitting socket that can fit a range of transradial amputees, incorporate EMG electrodes for myocontrol, and connect to a range of terminal devices (myoelectric hands) so that it may be used as a realistic proxy for a definitive myocontrol socket.

## **Digital Media**
### Mobile App UI/UX Design
Course: Digital Media Capstone
Instructor: Michael Flint
The Healthy Wallet, a Boston-based financial coaching service, empowers women of color to achieve debt freedom and generational wealth by organizing their finances and shifting their money mindset.
As part of their expansion, the company is developing a mobile app for financial coaching. In this project, students designed a wireframe for the app, focusing on the overall look and feel, user experience, and key features. The wireframe was carefully crafted to ensure it could seamlessly transition to mobile app developers for the next stage of implementation.

Course: Leading Teams Strategically in a Global Environment
Instructor: Nancy Robbie
1 Acre of Trees, a woman-owned nursery, specializes in growing New England native and non-native trees, offering bare-root, air-pruned saplings for autumn planting.
The company sought student assistance to expand its customer base and stabilize its seasonal revenue model. Students analyzed the nursery’s market position and recommended strategic partnerships with New England municipalities, landscaping companies, and environmental organizations. These recommendations aim to strengthen the business’s revenue streams and address the cyclical nature of its operations.
