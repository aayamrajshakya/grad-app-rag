The Graduate Certificate in Construction Management offers students a broad introduction to the principles of construction management, including:
  * alternative delivery methods and controls for construction projects
  * safety
  * project risk
  * quality management
  * team leadership
  * negotiation skills and techniques


Through a targeted curriculum designed for owners' representatives, consulting engineers, architects, design engineers, contractors, and subcontractors this certificate program addresses an urgent industry need for dynamic and skilled construction focused managers - a need that has only accelerated as construction projects become increasingly complex.
Northeastern’s construction management certificate is intended for those who have already earned a Bachelor of Science degree, (but not necessarily in construction), and who have been identified by their companies as having high potential for advancement while also being good candidates for the program.
###  Program objectives
  * To increase the skills and knowledge of a wide range of construction professionals
  * To help students with strong professional backgrounds and a BS degree - in fields other than construction - seeking to advance their careers
