#  Students Studying in The United States 
F-1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) work authorization, which allows actively enrolled students to gain relevant work experience within their field of study. 
##  What is Pre-Completion OPT? 
Optional Practical Training (OPT) is an employment authorization benefit for F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their major field of study. It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the accepted employment is related to their program of study. Students may engage in Pre-Completion OPT (or Pre-OPT) while actively enrolled in an academic program. To request Pre-OPT work authorization, students must:
  1. Request an I-20 with a recommendation for Pre-OPT from OGS
  2. Submit an application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for review and adjudication


Students are eligible for a total of 12-months
Important Considerations
If you are considering applying for Pre-OPT, it is important to understand how this may impact your future eligibility for Post-Completion OPT (Post-OPT). U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) does not allow two OPT applications to be pending at the same time. This means that your Pre-OPT application must be fully processed—either approved or denied—and your Employment Authorization Document (EAD) received before OGS can recommend Post-OPT. Because we cannot predict how long USCIS will take to process your Pre-OPT application, choosing to apply for Pre-OPT may cause delays in your Post-OPT application timeline.
Additionally, if you apply for Pre-OPT during your final term, you must confirm your graduation timeline with your Academic Advisor before submitting your application. Once Pre-OPT is approved for your final term, your program end date and Pre-OPT end date cannot be shortened in SEVIS. Because periods of OPT cannot overlap, having Pre-OPT approved through your final term could make you ineligible for Post-Completion OPT if your program end date changes unexpectedly.
##  Eligibility 
A Bachelor’s or Master’s degree student may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT prior to completion of studies both during the academic year and during the annual vacation period.
PhD students may be eligible to apply for Pre-OPT any time during the program of study if all course work other than the thesis/dissertation has been completed.
To apply for Pre-OPT, all of the following criteria must be met:
  * You must be maintaining lawful F-1 student status
  * You have studied as a full-time degree-seeking student in the U.S. for at least 1 academic year at an SEVP authorized school 
    * Time spent in language training and non-degree programs does not count toward the one academic year requirement
  * You have not exceeded 364 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the current degree level
  * You have not previously engaged in 12 months of full-time Pre- or Post-OPT at your current degree level
  * You have registered for a full-time course load with appropriate on-ground presence during the entire period of requested Pre-OPT 
    * This does not apply if the requested Pre-OPT will take place during the annual vacation period


##  Full-time vs. Part-time Pre-OPT 
A student may be eligible to apply for part-time (less than 20 hours per week) or full-time (more than 20 hours per week) Pre-OPT. Please see below for eligibility requirements for both options:
Part-Time Pre-OPT
  * During an academic term
  * During annual vacation and other official school breaks


Full-Time Pre-OPT
  * During annual vacation and other official school breaks
  * For PhD students who have completed all coursework except thesis/dissertation
  * NOTE: full-time pre-OPT is NOT


##  Special Considerations for PhD students 
If a PhD student has completed all coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing the thesis/dissertation.
In this case, the PhD student and his/her college need to determine the program completion date, which will be reflected on the I-20.
If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing your thesis/dissertation:
  * You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-OPT
  * The days you do not have a job count towards your 90 days of unemployment time
  * You cannot request a program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-OPT is expired


Note
###  Notice about Social Security Numbers 
As of April 25, 2025: If you do not already have a Social Security Number (SSN) OGS recommends that you do not attempt to apply for a SSN within your I-765 Application to USCIS for Pre-OPT. If you need an SSN, please wait for your Employment Authorization Document (EAD), apply for the SSN online, and make an appointment at the Social Security Administration (SSA).

  * You can [check current processing times on USCIS’s website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)


After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for Pre-OPT, you should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS.
##  What Happens After I Submit my Application to USCIS? 
  * You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can [look up your case status online](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do) using the case number.

Note
OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.).
##  Unemployment During Pre-OPT 
There are no restrictions on unemployment during Pre-OPT.
Students are not required to have a job offer to apply for Pre-Completion OPT; however, it is advantageous to have prospective employment opportunities since any time authorized for Pre-OPT is subtracted from the time available for Post-OPT, whether the student obtains employment or not.
##  Important Reminders 
  * USCIS must receive the Pre-OPT application within 30 days of the issued OPT recommendation by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days after the issuance of the OPT I-20, the application will be denied (this is the most common reason for the denial of Pre-OPT
  * If your entire application is returned to you, consult with an OGS Advisor before resubmitting the application; your application may not be considered “received” and you may need a new I-20 with OPT recommendation
  * Do not submit a Pre-OPT application to USCIS prior to obtaining an I-20 with the OPT recommendation
  * Make sure that the address on your OPT application is valid for receiving mail at all times during OPT processing
  * If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and are simultaneously applying for [Post-OPT](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/), OGS will not issue a Post-Completion OPT Recommendation I-20 until: 
    * Your Pre-Completion OPT application has been approved by USCIS and you have received your EAD, or
    * OGS receives confirmation that your application has been withdrawn by USCIS (or was never submitted to USCIS).


##  Travel While on Pre-OPT 
During Pre-OPT, travel restrictions remain the same as they are during normal F-1 study. You should carry the following documents when re-entering the U.S.:
  * A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S.
  * Unexpired F-1 visa
  * I-20 with a valid travel signature (travel signatures are valid for 1 year)

If you have a pending Pre-OPT application and you would like to apply for Post-OPT, then you will need to deduct the entire requested Pre-Completion OPT period from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT. If your Pre-Completion OPT has been approved, the entire approved period will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT.
Part-time Pre-Completion OPT is deducted at half the rate from your Post-Completion OPT. For example, if you are approved for 4 months of part-time Pre-Completion OPT, then 2 months will be deducted from your 12 months of Post-Completion OPT.
####  [ I am doing Pre-OPT and want to do Post-Completion OPT right after. Do I have to apply twice or can I apply for both at the same time? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-pre-completion-opt/#collapse-10)
