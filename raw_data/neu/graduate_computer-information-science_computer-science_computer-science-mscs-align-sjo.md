2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Master of Science in Computer Science—Align students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, with undergraduate majors including math, biology, history, engineering, and classics. The program begins with a two-semester introductory sequence, which provides the foundational knowledge for students from nontechnical backgrounds to succeed. Students have an opportunity to acquire both the knowledge needed to transition into a new career and the practical skills to build the next great app. 
## MS Thesis Committee 
The MS thesis committee must satisfy the following conditions:
1. A total of three members, including the advisor.
2. Two members from Khoury College of Computer Sciences (or affiliated to Khoury).
3. At least one member who is at “arm’s length” from the particular work in the thesis. This means that there should be at least one member who isn’t a co-advisor on the thesis.
4. External members are allowed but not required.
More members (internal or external) can be added as readers to the committee, so long as the above minimum requirements are fulfilled. 
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
## Align Bridge Coursework 
Students are required to take all bridge courses unless otherwise determined by the program.
A grade of B or higher is required in each course.
