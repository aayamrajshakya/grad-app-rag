Program overview 
##  Leaders in climate solutions 
Offered jointly by the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, the MS in Climate Science and Engineering prepares students to tackle the inherently multidisciplinary challenges that climate change presents for both natural and engineered systems.
The program provides training in the fundamental science of climate systems, as well as the engineering strategies and technologies required for decarbonization and adaptation to climate change. The curriculum includes a core set of courses that build essential knowledge and analytical skills, with restricted electives that allow students to explore climate-related topics from low-carbon energy systems to nature-based solutions to urban adaptation planning.
