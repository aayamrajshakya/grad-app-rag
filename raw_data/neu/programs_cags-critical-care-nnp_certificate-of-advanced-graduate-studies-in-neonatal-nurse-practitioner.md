Experiential learning opportunities 
The Neonatal Nurse Practitioner Program at Northeastern University is an online program that prepares seasoned neonatal nurses for the opportunity to earn their MSN degree and to sit for the national Neonatal NP board certification exam.
A clinical practicum will begin in the first semester of the second year of the program. During the clinical practicum, students will be working with an NNP preceptor to acquire the knowledge and skills to provide neonates with acute care as an advanced practice nurse in the intensive care setting. Students will work with their advisor to arrange clinical placements in neonatal ICUs within their geographic area.
The Northeastern University NNP program connects students to multiple preceptors in order to expose them to various practice styles and clinical settings. Our outstanding reputation in experiential and nursing education means that we have established clinical sites at a variety of prestigious institutions.
