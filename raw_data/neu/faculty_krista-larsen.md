#### CRIM 4120
Examines the role of criminal courts in the United States, the structure and organization of the court system, and the flow of cases from arrest to conviction. Focuses on the key actors in the courtroom-prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges, and court clerks-and the decision-making processes in charging a person with a crime, setting bail, pleading guilty, going to trial, and sentencing. Addresses prospects for reforming courts. 
  * ###  [Criminal Due Process](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/crim/)
#### CRIM 2100
Focuses on an historical evaluation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and its use in making rights prescribed under the Bill of Rights applicable to the individual states. Examines constitutional requirements in the administration of criminal justice with particular emphasis on the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendment requirements and their implications on police practices in the areas of arrests, searches and seizures, right to counsel, and eyewitness identification. Expects students to be familiar with basic concepts and legal language as well as the Court’s changing interpretations of the law. Briefing of cases is required. 
  * ###  [Introduction to Criminal Justice](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/crim/)
#### CRIM 1100
Surveys the contemporary criminal justice system in the United States. Students examine the phases of the criminal justice system beginning with the detection of crimes by the police, the handling of the case through the courts, and, finally, the disposition and sentencing of offenders. Issues and characteristics of each of the phases (police, courts, and corrections) are examined as well as identifying the key actors (police, judges, prosecutors, correctional officers, and so forth) of each phase of the criminal justice system. Also introduces students to the U.S. juvenile-justice system.
