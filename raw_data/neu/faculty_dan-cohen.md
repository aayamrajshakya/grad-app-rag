Dan Cohen is the Vice Provost for Information Collaboration, Dean of the Libraries, and professor of history at Northeastern University. His work has focused on the impact of digital media and technology on all aspects of knowledge and learning, from the nature of libraries and their evolving resources, to twenty-first century research techniques and software tools, to the changing landscape of communication and publication. He has directed major initiatives that have helped to shape that future.
Prior to his tenure at Northeastern, he was the founding Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America, which brought together the riches of America’s libraries, archives, and museums, and made them freely available to the world. Through a partnership with President Obama and other nonprofits and publishers, DPLA also distributed thousands of award-winning ebooks for free to millions of in-need children.
Before DPLA, Dan was a professor of history in the Department of History and Art History at George Mason University and the director of the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media. There he oversaw projects ranging from PressForward to the September 11 Digital Archive to the popular Zotero research tool.
