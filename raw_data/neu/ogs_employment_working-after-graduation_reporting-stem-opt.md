##  6, 12, 18, & 24-Month Validation Reporting Requirements 
Every six months during your STEM Extension (at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months), you are required to submit a validation report to confirm your employment information and contact information. Validation reports may be submitted as early as 30 days before the due date. Validations submitted to OGS by the due date are considered “timely” submitted and students should await confirmation from OGS that their validation report has been submitted to SEVP.
All validations must be [reported directly to OGS via the STEM Validation e-form.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/stem-validation-6-12-18-and-24-months/) Please do not email
**Note** : If you have more than one employer while on the STEM Extension, you will need to submit validation reports for each employer. Please use the “Additional Comments” section in the STEM Validation e-form to make a note of this so the assigned OGS advisor can reach out to you directly for confirmation, as the e-form will only allow reporting on one employer.
####  [ 6-month validation report ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78510803-1)
Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment.
You will also be required to upload a copy of the front and back of your STEM EAD card to the e-form.
####  [ 12-month validation report ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78510803-2)
Confirm to OGS the validity of the following information: legal name, residential address, employer name and address, job title, and status of current employment
Submit the Form I-983 with “Evaluation on Student Progress” section (top half of page 5 of the I-983) completed and signed
  * If signing digitally, parties may sign all signature fields on the Form I-983 using electronic signatures produced with software programs or applications or use digitally reproduced copies of a signature.
    * Typed signatures on the I-983 will not be accepted


**Note** : Even if you have not completed 12 months of employment with your current employer you must still submit the 12-month evaluation 
####  [ 18-month validation report ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78510803-3)

    * Typed signatures on the I-983 will not be accepted


Note:
##  Failure to Meet Reporting Requirements 
There typically are no immediate consequences for failing to submit the validation reports. However, there are two potential consequences for missing these reporting requirements:
  1. An automatic system termination of your SEVIS record for “Failure to Report While on OPT” is possible. This decision is at the discretion of USCIS/SEVP officials. **Note: OGS will NOT terminate your record due to a missed validation report**
  2. USCIS/SEVP may question your failure to submit validation reports during an application for future immigration benefits (e.g. H-1B). Your attorney would be advised to assist you with these inquiries


Even if you know that you missed the deadline and that your STEM Validation e-form will be denied, the OGS recommends submitting the e-form anyways as evidence that you made an effort to comply with the reporting requirements.
##  Changing Employers During the STEM Extension 
###  You may decide to change employers while your STEM OPT Extension is pending with USCIS and/or after the STEM OPT Extension has been approved by USCIS. Anytime you decide to change employers, you must report all changes within 10-days. 
####  [ Changing Employers while the STEM Extension is Pending with USCIS ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78536148-1)
Changing employers while your STEM OPT application is pending can cause delays and complications, so it is generally not recommended. However, if that you do need to change your employer while your application is pending, the new employer must also be enrolled in the [E-Verify program](https://www.e-verify.gov/) and the position must meet all STEM requirements. You must report the change of employer to USCIS by doing the following:
  1. The new employer and the student must complete a new Form I-983
  2. The student must submit the [STEM Extension I-20 Request](https://myogs.northeastern.edu/istart/controllers/client/ClientEngine.cfm?serviceid=EFormGroupProvider&eformGroup=31) to OGS and select the option ‘ _My STEM is pending and my employer has changed_ ’
     * This e-form will require you to upload the completed I-983 for your new employer as well as the I-983 for your previous employer. Students must complete the final evaluation for their previous employer (page 5) only if they worked for that employer after the end date of their Post-OPT EAD. 
  3. If you applied onlineubmit the following documents to USCIS via the myUSCIS account by uploading them under “Your Cases” > “Documents”> Unsolicited Evidence
     * Copy of STEM OPT I-20 with new employer information (remember to sign the I-20!)
     * Letter of explanation regarding the employer change including USCIS receipt number, your full name, the new employer’s name, and the employer’s E-Verify information
  4. If you applied using a paper applicationSend the documents listed below to USCIS (to the address on the STEM OPT application receipt notice, not to the lock-box address where the original application was mailed)
     * Letter of explanation regarding the employer change including USCIS receipt number, your full name, the new employer’s name, and the employer’s E-Verify information
     * Copy of USCIS receipt notice 
     * Copy of STEM OPT I-20 with new employer information (remember to sign the I-20!)


####  [ Changing Employers Once Your STEM Extension has been Approved ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78536148-2)

###  You are permitted up to 60-days of unemployment during the STEM OPT period. While on STEM OPT you may use unused unemployment days from your Post-OPT period (up to 150 days of total unemployment). 
####  [ Can I travel outside of the U.S. while I'm unemployed? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78615663-1)
If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S.
####  [ What happens if I exceed my available days of unemployment? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78615663-2)
If you exceed your available days of unemployment, then you are considered out of status and your SEVIS record may be autoterminated; there is no additional grace period.
####  [ I am nearing the maximum number of days of unemployment - what are my options? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-78615663-3)
If you are close to exceeding your available days of unemployment, you may have a few options:
  * Leave the U.S. before you have exceeded your unemployment days.


  * Apply for and be accepted to a new academic program and request a SEVIS transfer before you’ve exceeded your unemployment days. The new program would need to start within 5 months of the last day of your OPT (based on the transfer out date) in order for you to remain in the U.S. with the same SEVIS record.


  * Submit an application to USCIS for a change of status to another immigration status that allows you to remain in the U.S. while the application is pending. The application must be filed before you exceed your unemployment days.

####  [ When do I need report my 6 month validation? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/#collapse-1)
Once your STEM period has started (the day after your OPT EAD expires), then you must complete the [STEM OPT Validation e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/stem-validation-6-12-18-and-24-months/) every 6 months.
At the 12 and 24 month mark, you will need to include an Evaluation on Student Progress along with your 6 month validation. These evaluations are found on the final page of your I-983 document. The boxes should only be completed at the 12/24 month mark of your STEM authorization.
The SEVP portal will now send students reminders regarding their STEM validation, so make sure to add SEVP to your safe sender list. Furthermore, you can calculate your own validation periods by adding 6/12/18/24 months from your original STEM approval date.
The STEM validation function is only available to DSOs for a specific window of time, so make sure to submit your validation either before or on the day it is due.
