  * Upon receipt of your form data, the appropriate faculty admissions committee will review your academic records.
  * After that, admissions staff will notify you of your status and/or will let you know if additional information or action is needed.


The process can take about a month from the time you submit your form data until you receive a response regarding your program of interest. You may submit more than one request if you have multiple programs of interest.
Students who are currently pursuing their BS degree should submit the form preferably at the beginning of their final term of undergraduate study for graduate admissions consideration beginning the following term (e.g. for current students graduating in May, submit the form in January for graduate admissions consideration for Fall term entry).
