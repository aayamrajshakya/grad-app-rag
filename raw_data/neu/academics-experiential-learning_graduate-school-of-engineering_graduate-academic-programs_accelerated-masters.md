#  PlusOne Accelerated Master's Program 
##  Earn a Master's Degree in a Year 
A master’s degree can provide you an additional level of expertise in an area aligned with your career goals. As a currently enrolled Bachelor of Science (BS) student at Northeastern, you have the opportunity to earn a Master of Science degree (MS) in an accelerated time period with the PlusOne program. Once accepted into the program in an approved [PlusOne pathway](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=PlusOne), which is a BS and MS PlusOne combination, you can earn an MS degree with, in most cases, just one extra year of study beyond your undergraduate degree program.

## How It Works
PlusOne is either a five-year program, including opportunity for two six-month co-op positions as part of the undergraduate curriculum, or a six-year program with three six-month co-op experiences as an undergraduate, or two co-ops as an undergraduate and one as a graduate student.
First earn your BS degree in your chosen four or five year plan, and, in most cases, graduate with your MS degree the following year. To earn an MS degree in one year in the PlusOne program rather than the traditional two years, you will use either two or four MS courses to fulfill some of your BS requirements, thus using those courses to meet both sets of degree requirements.
Students can apply for the PlusOne program in their undergraduate academic year that they will begin taking PlusOne graduate courses. Students cannot apply for the PlusOne program in the final semester of their undergraduate degree program. Students must have an overall GPA of at least 3.0 to be eligible for admission to the PlusOne program.
View the [PlusOne Details and Policies page](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-academic-programs/accelerated-masters/plusone-details-policies/) for eligibility, how to apply and more information.
## The PlusOne Advantage
_Accelerate Learning._ Earn your BS degree, and, in most cases, one year later (rather than the traditional two years) graduate with an MS degree. Participate in co-op as an undergraduate for real-world experience.
_Reduce Costs._ Use some classes during your undergraduate program toward your master’s degree cutting the cost of earning your masters. Also take advantage of the [MS for PlusOne COE Tuition Scholarship](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-tuition-financial-aid/#plusone).
_Get Two Degrees._ BS conferral is independent of the MS degree so earning your BS degree is not affected by progress in the MS program.
_Specialize or Pivot._ Gain advanced knowledge in your field, specialize in a complementary high growth area, add management knowledge, or take a new path.
_Gain a Competitive Edge._ Select from a broad array of BS and MS PlusOne combinations within the College of Engineering and across the university to personalize your path and stand out with an advanced degree.
## Pick Your PlusOne Pathway
There is a broad array of BS and MS PlusOne combinations within the College of Engineering and across the university, for you to choose. Students can take a master’s in their current field (e.g., BS in mechanical engineering and MS in mechanical engineering), specialize in a high growth area (such as robotics, data analytics engineering, information systems, and others), add management skills with the MS in engineering management, or pursue a new path altogether.
### How To Find Your PlusOne Pathway
  * View your [BS degree program web page](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=BS;BS/JD) to see the PlusOne pathways available with that BS degree.
  * Then, view the MS degree page(s) of the pathway(s) you are interested in to learn about the programs and select one that interests you.
  * Contact your [academic advisor](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/undergraduate-studies/undergraduate-academic-advising/) for assistance in selecting a pathway and your courses.
  * Schedule a meeting with our [PlusOne Ambassador](https://outlook.office.com/book/MeetingwithCOEPlusOneAmbassador@northeastern.onmicrosoft.com/?ismsaljsauthenabled) to hear a current student’s perspective on the program.

> “What’s so valuable about the PlusOne Program is that it gives you the most potential to succeed. You can tell employers right off the bat, ‘Hey, this is where I worked [on co-op],’ and on top of that you have a master’s.”  Daniel Simpson, E'24, mechanical Engineering, ME'25, robotics 
> "[Co-workers] admitted to me that they found the prospect of going back to school daunting. It seemed more in line with my goals to keep going [with the PlusOne]." Derek Smith, E’20, chemical engineering, ME’21, chemical engineering 
> “The PlusOne program is an incredible opportunity for anyone interested in continuing their education, as it gives the flexibility to pursue advanced coursework at the undergraduate level, maximizing your time while at Northeastern." Michael Parrish, E'20, ME'20, bioengineering 
> “I think that you learn a lot of foundational knowledge at the undergraduate level, but then in the master’s program, you have the chance to apply this knowledge." Sarah Adamo, E'22, E'23, electrical engineering
