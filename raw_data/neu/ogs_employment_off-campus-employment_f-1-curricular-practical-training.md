#  Students Studying in The United States 
Curricular Practical Training (CPT) is a benefit for eligible F-1 students to authorize approved experiential learning that takes place in the U.S. or with a U.S. based employer. 
##  Understanding Curricular Practical Training (CPT) 
CPT is a form of curricular training authorization available for eligible F-1 students during their program of study for experiential learning opportunities that are necessary and integral, or required, as part of an academic program at Northeastern University.
  * CPT authorization must be obtained
  * CPT authorization is required prior to the intended start date of the experiential learning
  * CPT can be either full-timeor part-time
  * CPT can be either paid or unpaid
  * CPT is employer, location, full-time/part-time, and date specific. 
  * Students must maintain on-ground presence


Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted. Any extensions, cancellations, or changes to authorized CPT must be first approved by the academic advisor/co-op coordinator and OGS.
Non-curricular based on-campus activities (commonly referred to as “on-campus employment”) do not require CPT authorization. If you have any questions about how this applies to you, please contact OGS.
If you are a student considering volunteering or engaging in unpaid internships at Northeastern or a staff/faculty looking to hire a volunteer or unpaid intern, please review [this guidance](https://generalcounsel.northeastern.edu/about/volunteer-and-intern-toolkit/) from Northeastern’s University Office of General Counsel.
##  Eligibility Requirements 
###  In order to be eligible for CPT, students must meet all of the following requirements 
####  [ Comply with all college academic and enrollment eligibility requirements and policies for experiential learning ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-13996949-1)
This includes every co-op, internship, practicum, clinical rotation, corporate residency, experiential PhD, or other experiential learning opportunity, whether the activity takes place on-campus or off-campus
####  [ Enroll in a course that requires an experiential learning component in the syllabus. ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-13996949-2)
  * This will usually be a Co-op course or another program-required course
  * Enrollment must be maintained for the entire period of authorized CPT


####  [ Complete at least one academic year as a full-time, degree-seeking student with an active SEVIS record* ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-13996949-3)
  * One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters while maintaining on-ground presence
  * Time spent in Prematriculation and Pathway programs (including N.U.in, Foundation Year, NU Immerse, Global Scholars, and Global Pathways) will not accrue time toward CPT eligibility. Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program


*Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances:
  * For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion
  * For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify 
    * Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review “Change of Status and Transfer Students” below for more information


####  [ Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-13996949-4)
Review the OGS [Guidelines on Maintaining Status](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/) for more information
A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits.
####  [ Make normal progress towards degree completion ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-13996949-5)
CPT authorization must not cause a delay in the completion of a student’s academic program
##  Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT 
F-1 international students must maintain **on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status**. This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization.Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms.
Defined Practical Experience Methods: 
  * In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location 
  * Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer’s physical location
  * Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer’s physical location


Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization 
To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options:
  * Option 1
    * Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer
  * Option 2
    * Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. 
    * **Co-op students only** : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements.If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor.


Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization 
F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. 
As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are **not eligible** to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term.
Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization 
F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above.
Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence 
If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student’s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated.
Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience.
Travel during Experiential Learning 
Engaging on-site at your employer’s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status.
Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. 
If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits. 
_F-1/J-1 students who are physically located outside of the U.S. do not require work authorization from OGS. However, F-1/J-1 students participating in a [Global Co-op](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/study-research-abroad-global-coop/#:~:text=the%20instructions%20below.-,REPORTING%20ACADEMIC%20ACTIVITIES%20OUTSIDE%20OF%20THE%20U.S.%20TO%20OGS%20AND%20MAINTAINING%20F%2D1/J%2D1%20STUDENT%20STATUS,-International%20students%20may)should report their activities to OGS in order to receive an updated I-20/DS-2019._
##  Application Process 
###  To participate in an experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., F-1 students must obtain CPT authorization from OGS. All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. 
####  [ Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14072926-1)
The student
  * [Electronic I-94 ](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)(“Class of Admission” must be F-1 and “Admit Until Date” must indicate “D/S”)
  * Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization


When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form.
[CPT Authorization Request e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/cpt-authorization-request-form/)
####  [ Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14072926-2)
The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS.
If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision.
See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists

  * [Graduate Students](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/authorized-cpt-secondary-approvers-for-graduate-students/)


####  [ Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14072926-3)
Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student’s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request.
####  [ Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14072926-4)
If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to:
  * Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete
  * Print and sign your I-20
  * Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20


##  Updating or changing your CPT authorization 
While on CPT, any updates, extensions, changes, or cancellations to your employment must be reported to and approved both by your academic/co-op advisor and by a DSO in OGS.
  * Employer
  * Location
  * Date
  * Number of hours worked per week (full-time/part-time)
  * Cancellations
  * Other corrections


Once authorized for CPT, F-1 students must comply with the authorization granted.

##  How CPT affects OPT Eligibility 
If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPTdoes not
  * When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization.


It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this [e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/cpt-authorization-history-request/).
As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may

####  [ Change of Status Students ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14111926-1)
Full-time students who have applied to change their immigration status to F-1 within the U.S. (application through USICS) or by traveling (via consular processing) may be eligible to use time from a previous immigration status towards accruing benefits, such as CPT, as long as the student has previously maintained full-time enrollment requirements.
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and bring all applicable documentation with you (e.g. official transcripts, a copy of your I-797 approval notice if you changed status within the U.S.).
####  [ SEVIS Transfer Students ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/#collapse-14111926-2)
International students with Active F-1 records who transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University may be eligible to use enrolled time at the previous institution towards the one academic year requirement for CPT eligibility.
Please contact OGS to make an appointment with a DSO to discuss CPT eligibility and have all applicable documentation available (e.g. official transcripts and your previous I-20)
