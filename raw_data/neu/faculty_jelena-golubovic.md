## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ### Peoples and Cultures
#### ANTH 1101
Surveys basic concepts in cultural anthropology by looking at a range of societies and the issues they face in a globalizing world. Examines the manner in which cultures adapt to, reject, or modify all of the changes they face. These changes impact everything from traditional family structure, to religion, gender, all the way to patterns of joking and concepts of beauty the world over. 
  * ###  [Security, Culture, Power](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/social-sciences-humanities/international-affairs/#coursestext)
#### INTL 3450
Offers a critical and interdisciplinary approach to the study of security. Analyzes the politics, culture, geography, and history of security as a major force shaping the contemporary world. Aims to develop a critical analysis of how power operates in and through security by examining questions of how security shapes cities, states, space, and society from the cultural and psychological terrain of fear to the international terrain of war, capitalism, migration, and transnational conflicts. 


### Anthropology of Eastern Europe
#### ANTH 4210
Explores the societies, cultures, and politics of Eastern Europe, focusing on social upheaval and cultural change after the fall of state socialism. Examines themes including capitalist transition, European integration, ethnic and religious conflict, nation-building, and state contestation, maintaining a focus on the everyday realities of Eastern Europeans. Covers key theoretical debates about East-West geopolitical polarity, drawing on decolonial and postcolonial perspectives to challenge representations of Eastern Europe as transitional, peripheral, or backwards.
