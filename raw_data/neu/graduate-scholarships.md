For additional information regarding the Full Circle Scholarship, including eligible programs, please visit the [Graduate Programs website](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/full-circle-scholarship/).
### Merit Scholarships
Students in graduate programs may also be considered for available merit-based scholarships through their application for admission as well as available scholarship opportunities through their department or college. Please note that scholarship eligibility criteria may vary depending on the scholarship and the program or college. To be considered for merit-based scholarships through your college or program, you must submit your application for admission by the applicable deadline date.
If you have questions regarding merit-based scholarships for [graduate programs](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/programs/) please contact the department, college, or school to which you are applying to or are currently enrolled.
### Outside Scholarships
You must report all private sources of student financial aid to the Northeastern University Office of Student Financial Services in writing. Please complete the Outside Scholarship Recipient Form in the Student Hub to do this
Outside awards are considered part of your aid package and, in most cases, will be applied first to unmet financial need, then to replace loans and/or work-study, and if necessary, to reduce institutional grants and/or scholarships.
If you have a scholarship payment, please forward it to the address below. If the external organization requires a billing statement or other verification from the University, please send a copy of the organization’s request to the address below:
Northeastern University  
Student Financial Services  
ATTN: General Scholarship, 354 Richards Hall  
360 Huntington Avenue
