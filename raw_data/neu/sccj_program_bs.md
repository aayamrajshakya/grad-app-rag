#  Bachelor of ScienceCriminal Justice
### Your Criminal Justice Experience Starts Here
Through our curriculum, criminal justice majors will be able to understand, predict, and explain crime and contribute to the development of public policy within communities. Our students will develop intellectually and ethically while engaging with the curriculum through hands-on experience. In addition to a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, we also offer unique combined majors and the ability to minor for those whose interests extend beyond the components of the criminal justice system. Minors can also specialize further in their elective courses. These may include courses in security, policing, corrections, and juvenile justice. A minor in criminology and criminal justice in combination with a student’s major can enhance the student’s career possibilities.

Our undergraduates can pursue co-ops, research projects, study-abroad placements, directed studies, and service-learning in their chosen field of interest.
