# Artificial Intelligence at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
The science behind the AI technology that is revolutionizing everyday life
Artificial intelligence has opened new frontiers in computing — and changes in how our world works — that are comparable to the advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s. Computer scientists are at the heart of this transformation, refining theoretical and formal knowledge, as well as building the tools and programs that underpin AI.
As AI becomes more prevalent, not just in our direct interactions with computers but also in transportation, health care, robotics, entertainment, and other sectors, it is critical that research and understanding extend past the technical aspects to consider how the augmentation, or “sixth sense” that AI may provide, can be developed safely, ethically, and in service to humans. Khoury College researchers are leading the way in their exploration of the technical foundations of AI, as well as the human implications of its recent explosive growth.

## Transforming the way we design, build, teach, and communicate
AI research is affecting daily life for many, as more and more computer tools embed AI capacity. This is transforming work by transferring tasks that once required humans to automated programs. AI assistants are also aiding human work across technical, editorial, logistical, and everyday contexts. 
In addition to the transformative impact on work, Khoury College’s AI research is helping develop methods that fuel scientific breakthroughs. Tasks that require analysis of massive datasets (far beyond the capacity of non-AI programs) can now be designed, bringing the promise of completely new approaches in medical research and materials science among others.
AI research is also having a considerable impact on computer science itself. It touches every research area at Khoury College, at the same time shifting the focus of software development as a profession, AI automates many burdensome tasks in development, freeing up time to work more strategically and creatively, leading to better programs. 
## Sample research areas
  * Machine learning
  * Sensing
  * AI in health care
  * AI in software development
  * Large language models
  * Cognitive, emotional, social, and physical behavior models
  * Application of human behavior modeling to the design of health interventions
  * Social skills training to simulate social systems
  * Robotic systems capable of flexibly interacting with the world
  * Design of virtual humans capable of interacting with people using verbal and nonverbal behavior


## Khoury researchers: At the forefront
Timothy Bickmore discusses how his lab’s research aims to increase health-care access for patients and decrease the cost of care.
Rob Platt talks about his work in exploring machine learning models that is advancing the development of self-learning robots.
## Current project highlights

The Relational Agents Group 
##  The Relational Agents Group 
The Relational Agents Group at Khoury College is developing AI-based tools to help computers provide simulations of face-to-face behavioral health care. They are pioneering how to build chat tools to provide health coaching, psychotherapy, health education, and virtual agents that can improve management of chronic diseases.

Improve the planning and decision-making abilities of robots 
##  Improve the planning and decision-making abilities of robots 
Researchers at Khoury College are studying how to improve the planning and decision-making abilities of robots. How can AI help in situations where robots have limited information (partial observability) and need to interact with other robots or agents (multi-agent systems)? Their goal is to develop methods that allow robots to reason, coordinate, and learn even in these challenging environments.

## Recent research publications
**[On robot grasp learning using equivariant models](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10514-023-10112-w)**  
Authors:
Khoury researchers are tapping AI and related areas to create new methods to help robots learn to pick up objects. Symmetric Grasp helps robots focus on the symmetries in many common objects when trying to figure out how to grasp something, speeding learning and making robots more efficient.
**[Improving Deep Policy Gradients With Value Function Search](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=6qZC7pfenQm)**  
Authors:
This research improves a technique used to train computers. Deep policy gradients refer to the elements that computers used to control robots or other agents. Khoury researchers are developing ways to improve how the model estimates value, which helps a system learn faster and achieve better performance. 
**[HITSnDIFFs: From Truth Discovery to Ability Discovery by Recovering Matrices with the Consecutive Ones Property](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00013)**  
Authors:
This research introduces a new way of using AI to determine the correct answers. If you look at large groups of user responses, how can you rank users based on their overall ability to answer questions accurately? Khoury researchers and colleagues propose an algorithm called HITSnDIFFs (HND) that takes tools from standardized test research to analyze responses and rank them, potentially opening up more accurate and efficient ways for AI to work.**[
