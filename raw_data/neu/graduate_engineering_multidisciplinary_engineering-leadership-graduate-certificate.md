The Gordon Engineering Leadership Program is a transformational, technical, and challenging graduate-level learning experience targeted for engineering professionals.
The Gordon Engineering Leadership Program directed by the Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership offers a graduate certificate that pairs with over 25 master's degrees in the College of Engineering, College of Science, and Khoury College of Computer Sciences. The Gordon Program is a transformational graduate program designed to build a future corps of engineering leadership professionals.
Pursuing the graduate certificate allows participants to:
  * Take part in a hands-on curriculum taught by industry-experienced professors
  * Work with peers from across engineering fields on leadership skills development
  * Receive one-on-one mentoring from industry experts and faculty


The Gordon Engineering Leadership Program anchors around an intense, market-worthy challenge project based on your organization’s strategic needs. This is a unique opportunity to apply your classroom experience in a professional setting, potentially further accelerating your career.
## How to Earn a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
If you already have a Master of Science, then you can complete the one-year program to earn a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
If you do not have a Master of Science, then you can still be considered for the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership if you have at least three years of engineering work experience.
Additional information can be found on the [Gordon Engineering Leadership Program website. ](https://gordon.northeastern.edu)
## Beyond a Graduate Certificate
Most candidates pursue the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program as part of a Master of Science degree in the engineering discipline of their choice. Upon completion, they earn both a Master of Science degree and a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
