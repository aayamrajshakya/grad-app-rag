When Diyali Goswami moved from the bustling streets of Mumbai to the tranquil city of Portland, Maine, she didn’t know exactly what to expect. She had come from a city known for its chaos and heat, and Portland felt like a complete change—quieter, cooler, and filled with new opportunities.
“I came from Mumbai, which is a very big city, very crowded, very chaotic. Portland is completely the opposite,” she says. The change, however, was exactly what she needed as she set out on a path to pursue a [Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-electrical-and-computer-engineering-boston-5265/) at Northeastern.
## The draw of Northeastern University and Portland, Maine
For Diyali, Northeastern wasn’t an unknown name. “I have had a lot of friends and family members who have studied at Northeastern,” she explains. After researching the university’s programs, she knew it was the right fit.
But what really sealed the deal was the opportunity to study at the [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/) on the [Portland campus](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/global-campus-network/portland-campus/). “I learned that, in Portland, they were offering the same course with a lot more flexibility, and they have the Experiential AI Institute, which was really interesting to me,” she adds. On top of that, the tech opportunities in Portland were growing, and a scholarship offer made the decision even easier.
## A co-op that changes everything
One of the most impactful experiences for Diyali during her time at Northeastern has been her co-op, a term she was previously unfamiliar with. “I just knew internships,” she admits, but the [co-op program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/academics-outcomes/our-learning-model/experiential-learning/) offered something more immersive—a full-time role where she could gain real-world experience.
“You’re a regular employee. You go there, do your nine to five, attend meetings, and you’re not just seen as a newbie,” she says. Working with the startup Freya, a Techstars partner at the Roux, she’s been deeply involved in meaningful projects, like researching the relationship between women’s cortisol levels and their stress, as well as helping with marketing, SEO, and product development.
“I’ve been helping them with everything from data science to social media marketing and even designing handouts for an expo,” Diyali says. The breadth of her responsibilities reflects the flexibility and collaborative environment of working with a startup—a setting she specifically sought out with the help of her co-op advisor.

## Growing in every way
Diyali’s experience at the Roux Institute and in her co-op has been more than just academic—it’s also been deeply personal. As an international student, one of her biggest challenges was transitioning to life in a new country. “There’s a huge sense of community here and collaboration,” she reflects.
Beyond mastering new technical skills in AI and data science, Diyali has seen growth in her confidence and ability to work in a team setting. “I’ve learned to be more confident in speaking up, working with team members, and presenting in meetings,” she says.
In a startup environment, she’s also been able to join meetings with higher-ups and learn how to interact with investors—critical experiences that have helped shape her understanding of the professional world.
“I think grad school can be very intimidating, but I would tell anyone coming here to enjoy the experience. You’re here to learn, meet new people, and carve your career.”
## Life outside of school in Portland
Despite being focused on her academic and professional growth, Diyali finds time to enjoy the unique lifestyle Portland offers. “One of the best things about Portland is that it’s very walkable,” she says, a welcome change from Mumbai. Portland’s natural beauty has led her to become more active, whether she’s walking, hiking, or exploring the city’s vibrant food scene.
“Portland is known for its restaurants, and my favorite thing to do in my free time is find new cafes and go thrifting,” she adds with a smile. The city’s flea markets and antique stores have become a regular weekend pastime.
## A bright future ahead
Diyali believes the co-op experience and the education she’s receiving at the Roux Institute will set her up for success. “I think I have a competitive edge now,” she explains. The hands-on work in a real-world setting has allowed her to apply the theoretical knowledge she’s gained in her classes, and she’s confident that this will make the transition into the job market smoother.
With a growing network, practical experience, and new skills in data science and AI, Diyali’s journey from Mumbai to Portland has been one of personal and professional transformation.
