Program overview 
##  Bring a scientific eye to decision-making 
This program seeks to train students in the basic techniques and theory of operations research and their applications to real-world problems. Graduates develop their analytical skills to attack complex, large-scale optimization problems of both a deterministic and stochastic nature.
Eight 4-semester-hour graduate courses are required for this degree. Previous coursework will be evaluated to determine proficiency in certain content areas, and the degree plan may be tailored accordingly. In some cases, a student may be required to take an assessment exam to determine content and knowledge proficiency. No course can be used to satisfy both a requirement and an elective. To qualify for degree conferral, a minimum cumulative average of 3.000, equivalent to a grade of B, must be obtained. Some courses listed for this program are offered in the College of Engineering or the College of Computer and Information Science.
