## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
[ How do children succeed? How do risk and protective factors impact child development? This class considers how best to support children and family success through an exploration of theory, research and hands on service-learning. Child Intervention and Treatment ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/husv/)
#### HUSV 3520
This course compares and contrasts primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of intervention as they pertain to child welfare systems. Course themes may include child development, impacts of poverty on development, child maltreatment, educational inequality, disability, play, and delinquency. Specifically, this course will examine the effectiveness and efficiency of home-visiting based interventions, school-based interventions, child welfare interventions, and programs and practices targeted to reduce and eliminate juvenile delinquency. The availability, distribution, and effectiveness of these prevention, intervention, and treatment programs will be considered as they apply to children and their families. Hands on service learning in the field of child intervention will be completed to link the coursework on research and theory to human service practice.
