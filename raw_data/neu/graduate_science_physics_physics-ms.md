2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Department of Physics offers a Master of Science degree with several options. The standard physics MS can be earned by taking a specified set of courses without an MS thesis. Alternatively, an MS thesis may substitute for 8 semester hours of coursework. Both of these options may be pursued either full time or part time. Upon completion of the MS degree in physics, students should be able to apply graduate-level knowledge and solve problems in the areas of electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, and advanced mathematical methods.
## Grade Requirements
To qualify for the MS degree, a cumulative average of 3.000, equivalent to a grade of B, must be obtained. No more than two courses or 6 semester hours of credit, whichever is greater, may be repeated in order to satisfy the requirements for the MS degree. A student who does not maintain a 3.000 cumulative average for two consecutive semesters, or is otherwise not making satisfactory progress toward the MS degree requirements, may be recommended for termination at the discretion of the graduate committee.
Within the above limitations, a required course for which a grade of F is received must be repeated with a grade of C or better and may be repeated only once. Elective courses in which an F has been received may be repeated once to obtain a C or better.
## Transfer Credit
Students must petition, in writing, through the graduate committee to the director of graduate student services for all transfer credit. An official transcript must be attached to the Request for Transfer Credit form. A maximum of 9 semester hours of credit obtained at another institution may be accepted toward the MS degree provided that the credits transferred consist of a grade of B or better in graduate-level courses and have not been used toward any other degree. Grades are not transferred.
## Current MS Students Interested in the PhD Program
Physics MS students interested in applying to the [Physics, PhD](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/science/physics/physics-phd/) program must submit a complete application for admission.
## Special Student Status
Special students are allowed to earn credit for a maximum of 12 semester hours. Students interested in taking more than 12 semester hours must make a formal application to the degree program online.
## Coursework
The MS degree requires successful completion of a minimum of 32 semester hours of coursework. There are three options for the MS degree:
The first option is the standard physics MS without an MS thesis, requiring a minimum of 32 semester hours of coursework.
The second option is the standard physics MS with an MS thesis, requiring a minimum of 1 semester hour of thesis. Up to 8 semester hours of thesis can substitute for coursework.
The third option is the physics MS with thesis and specialization in applied physics, engineering physics, biophysics, chemical physics, material physics, mathematical physics, and computational physics.
Graduate students desiring the MS with thesis option should arrange a thesis with a faculty advisor. The thesis must demonstrate the individual's capacity to execute independent work based on original material. The thesis must be approved by the graduate committee. The thesis may be completed in one semester (e.g., summer semester) or in consecutive semesters. Students who have not completed their thesis after the required number of thesis credits must register for Thesis Continuation until the thesis is approved by the graduate school and submitted electronically to Proquest.
The degree requires a minimum of 32 semester hours of graduate credit. The 32 semester hours may include up to 9 semester hours of transfer credit, as approved by the department's graduate committee and the graduate school.
