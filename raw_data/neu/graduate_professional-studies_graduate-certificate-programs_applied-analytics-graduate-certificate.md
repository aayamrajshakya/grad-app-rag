2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
In a global environment characterized by digital transformation, rapid change, and high levels of uncertainty, the ability to hire, reskill, and upskill analytic talent is a major driver of organizational performance. The Graduate Certificate in Applied Analytics in the College of Professional Studies is designed to prepare students to develop analytical skills that will support decision making in an organization's strategy. The certification focuses on data discipline: navigating the sea of information that's generated by machines; technical ability: understanding how machines function and how to interact with them; and the human discipline: what humans can do that machines, for the foreseeable future, cannot emulate—all with an emphasis on experiential learning. Students also will have the opportunity to tailor their studies to support their specific career objectives.
To address the needs of students who are currently in an analytical role, as well as those who are new to the field, the certification curriculum incorporates a broad menu of course options and a pathway through the program based on a student's experience level, as well as concentrations that are aligned with student career objectives.
