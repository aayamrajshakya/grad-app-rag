#  Major inReligious Studies 
The program in religious studies offers the opportunity to acquire an understanding of religion within various cultural, historical, and political contexts through comparative approaches and an engagement with religion in everyday life. The major is designed to enable students to not only gain a breadth of knowledge across a variety of religious traditions but also to pursue in-depth mastery of particular traditions in their practical and cultural dimensions, including the various normative and ideological issues that arise out the manifestation of religion in human affairs. In addition to the study of particular traditions, religious studies majors will gain a general knowledge of the theoretical and methodological approaches employed in the academic study of religion. Through the major, a student will enhance the ability to think, interpret, and write critically about a range of religious traditions through diverse methodological approaches.
