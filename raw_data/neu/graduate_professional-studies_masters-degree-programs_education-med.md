2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
## ESL Instruction Concentration
The English as a Second Language Instruction concentration allows teachers with an initial teacher license in Massachusetts to earn an additional license in English as a Second Language (grades PreK–8 or 5–12). The coursework engages graduate students in subject-based knowledge and field experiences. There is a need for more Massachusetts teachers licensed in English as a Second Language, which makes this concentration an essential pathway for teachers to deepen their expertise to meet the broad range of students they work with.
## Learning and Instruction Concentration
The learning and instruction concentration in the MEd program is designed for teachers and leaders in K–12-focused schools and community organizations that want to lead change and expand equity in their classrooms, schools, or educational communities. Graduate students examine the impact of local, national, and global changes on educational policy and practice. They deepen their ability to effectively engage diverse students in meaningful learning through coursework focused on curriculum and assessment, teaching and learning, and experiential education.
Students pursuing Massachusetts ESL, preK–12, initial licensure: This program meets Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education standards and competencies for licensure as an English as a Second Language Teacher, pre-K–6 and 5–12.
## Special Education Concentration
Demand for graduate-level-prepared special education practitioners is on the rise, driven by heightened degree requirements and a shortage of licensed, qualified teachers. In response, the College of Professional Studies is pleased to offer the Master of Education with Concentration in Special Education. Designed for educators who are licensed in Massachusetts at the initial or professional level in another discipline, this innovative master’s degree program seeks to prepare you to meet the special needs of students across a variety of school environments.
