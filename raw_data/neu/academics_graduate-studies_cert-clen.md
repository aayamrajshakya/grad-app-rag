## Overview
The Graduate Certificate in Climate and Engineering will provide students with foundational knowledge in the climate system and our ability to mitigate or sequester emissions and adapt to climate change. The three-course program is geared towards STEM students and pairs well with MS and PhD programs within the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering
Climate change will be a defining challenge of the 21st century. Its effects are already being felt across the world and its burdens will especially fall on younger generations. Meeting the decarbonization goals proposed by many companies and countries will entail massive shifts toward low-carbon technologies and large-scale implementation of carbon sequestration and climate engineering solutions. At the same time, adapting to climate change and sea level rise will require re-engineering our coastlines, buildings, and transportation systems.

## Innovative Curriculum
The Graduate Certificate in Climate and Engineering is designed to provide students with a deep technical understanding of how climate change will impact engineered systems, as well as the analytical skills needed to evaluate designs that are climate-effective, safe, and minimize other environmental and social impacts.
Participating students will complete a total of 12 Semester Hours of courses to earn the Certificate in Climate and Engineering.
Certificates may be pursued in conjunction with a graduate degree, or independently. Students can double count up to three eligible courses for a graduate degree and this graduate certificate.
