## General admissions requirements
GRE 
##  GRE 
Northeastern University is GRE test-optional and does not require applicants to submit standardized testing to be considered for admission. However, the Khoury College PhD program in computer science highly encourages PhD applicants to submit GRE scores. Please note if you decide to self-report the GRE on your application, it will be considered as part of the admissions review process, and you will need to submit official verified test scores to complete your application file once accepted.
Transcript requirements 
##  Transcript requirements 
Transcripts from all previously attended post-secondary education institutions are required. For applicants who have graduated from any post-secondary education program(s), degree certificate(s) are also required. If transcript(s) and/or degree certificate(s) are issued in a language other than English, an English translation must accompany the native language documents. An English translation only will not be deemed sufficient. For applicants who are pursuing or have completed a four-year undergraduate degree program, a minimum of six semesters of courses, grades and credits must be reflected in uploaded documentation (for three-year undergraduate degree programs, a minimum of four semesters must be present).
For applicants who have obtained credentials from India, semester mark sheets and degree certificate(s)/provisional certificate(s) are required in addition to the consolidated transcript. If semester mark sheets are unavailable, an official communication on institutional letterhead must accompany the consolidated transcript indicating any retakes/backlogs associated with the program.
For applicants who have obtained credentials from China, the degree certificate and graduation certificate are required.
Please include the reverse side of the transcript(s) when uploading your documentation; specifically any grading scale information, legend, or university instructions included on the reverse side of the transcript(s) should also be included in the scanned copy.
English proficiency tests 
##  English proficiency tests 
An English language test score is required to apply to a PhD program. There is no minimum score required, but most successful applicants have a minimum score of 100 on TOEFL or 7.5 on IELTS.
**An exception can be made to the TOEFL/IELTS requirement if the student has received a bachelor’s degree, master’s, or PhD in a country where English is the official language.
