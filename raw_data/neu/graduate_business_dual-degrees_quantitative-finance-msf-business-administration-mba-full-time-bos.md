2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business is designed to position students to become leaders ready for the rapidly changing financial services industry. The [MSF Quantitative Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-finance-mba?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=ftmsfmba) dual degree integrates business knowledge with advanced mathematical and technical skills.
## Integrating Classroom and Professional Experiences
Learning by doing is a hallmark of a Northeastern MBA. Students apply their knowledge to actual business challenges through experience-fueled electives and class projects. Students gain invaluable experience at the intersection of business and finance through a corporate residency, translating ideas into action for three, six, or up to 12 months. Far removed from the typical internship, students work full time at a leading firm or startup in their field and have significant responsibilities as they work to deliver on organizational goals. 
## Cultivate Advanced Quantitative Finance Skills
Students pursue a major in quantitative finance that emphasizes the intersection of technology and business analytics with finance. Coursework integrates economics, mathematics, and computer science with financial theory and application. Students have an opportunity to develop mathematically demanding quantitative skills and fintech expertise.

By participating in the Fund, students may earn 1 semester hour per semester with the option to fulfill a 3-semester-hour elective course requirement by participating for three terms. 
## Concentrate in Analytics
