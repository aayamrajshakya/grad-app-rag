##  Do I need a travel signature? 
A travel signature is an endorsement on your I-20 or DS-2019, given by a Designated School Official (DSO) or Alternative Responsible Officer (ARO), after screening your immigration record and academic enrollment to verify lawful status.
  * If you are on an F-1 visa, this is the signature at the bottom of Page 2 of your current I-20. A travel signature is valid for 12 months during your academic program, and for 6 months during Post-Completion Optional Practical Training.
  * If you are on a J-1 visa, this is on the bottom right of your DS-2019. A travel signature is valid for 12 months.

##  How do I register my travel? 
Northeastern University highly recommends all students, faculty and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations abroad in “[My Travel Plans,](https://provost.northeastern.edu/international-travel/travel-guidance/travel-registry/)” also called the “Travel Registry.”  
This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create pose health or safety risks. In addition, it enables on-campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students, faculty, and staff who may need medical or security assistance.
