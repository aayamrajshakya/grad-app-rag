Direct-entry students enrolled in the dual PharmD/MPH degree are able to graduate with both a PharmD and MPH degree in just five years, saving one full year of study.

Accreditations 
[The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/pharmacy/programs/pharmd/)[/](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/pharmacy/programs/pharmd-mph-direct-entry/)[Master of Public Health](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/master-of-public-health-mph/) program at Northeastern University School of Pharmacy is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE). [The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE)](http://www.acpe-accredit.org/) is the national agency for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy and providers of continuing pharmacy education. ACPE (until 2003 known as the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education) was established in 1932 for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy, and in 1975 its scope was broadened to include accreditation of providers of continuing pharmacy education. The mission of ACPE is to assure and advance quality in pharmacy education. ACPE is an autonomous and independent agency whose board of directors is appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP), the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). Since the inception of its accreditation agency recognition program in 1952, ACPE has been recognized continuously by the U.S. Department of Education, and it gained recognition by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation in April 2004. State boards of pharmacy require that licensure applicants from the United States have graduated from an accredited pharmacy degree program to be eligible to sit for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination TM (NAPLEXÂ®).
Unique features 
  * Earn two advanced degrees simultaneously.
  * Broaden your academic training to include a public health perspective.
  * Save time and tuition.
  * Graduates are eligible to sit for the Certified in Public Health (CPH) Exam, the only professional certification specific to the field of public health.
  * PharmD/MPH students use one of their advanced practice study experiences to complete their rotation in a public health setting.
  * PharmD/MPH graduates fulfill the same competencies that guide [the MPH program](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/health-sciences/programs/master-public-health/) and the [PharmD program](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/programs/pharmacy-pharmd/).


Career outcomes 
There is a widely recognized need to increase training of students in an interdisciplinary manner or to be trained to participate in interdisciplinary work. The PharmD/MPH increases opportunities for pharmacists to expand their scope of practice and contribute to societal needs in public health. Need for public health pharmacists are expected to increase in areas including quality assurance, medication effectiveness, cost control, drug safety, and all-hazards planning, as well as in pharmacy education.
Experience-based learning 
The Northeastern co-operative education (co-op) model is the only program of its kind among U.S. pharmacy schools. PharmD/MPH students participate in up to three co-op experiences (two required pharmacy co-ops and one optional public health co-op), providing one full year of invaluable real-world experience. During the final year of the program, students complete Advanced Pharmacy Practice Experiences (APPEs) required of all PharmD programs. Of the six, six-week required rotations, one can be a public health-orientated placement. Additionally, in year five, students take a public health practicum in the fall and public health capstone in the spring.
