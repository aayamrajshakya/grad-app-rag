Program overview 
##  Advanced PNP career training 
This specialization is designed to prepare nurses with the specialized skills needed to care for at-risk children living in urban settings, across the continuum of care. For nearly two decades, our pediatric nurse practitioner (PNP) program has prepared primary care PNPs to provide community-based, culturally sensitive primary care. We are the only graduate nursing program in New England to prepare acute-care PNPs.
The School of Nursing offers two tracks for the pediatric nurse practitioner student. The primary care track prepares students for the role of pediatric nurse practitioner, focusing on well-child care and prevention and management of common acute and chronic illnesses. The dual track prepares students for the primary care role as well as the acute care role.
This program is appropriate for licensed nurses who possess a master’s degree in nursing.
