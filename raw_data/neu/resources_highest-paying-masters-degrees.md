People choose to pursue graduate degrees for [many reasons](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/reasons-to-go-back-to-grad-school/). Some are hoping it will give them the skills and experiences needed to advance in their field. Others want to [change careers](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-change-careers/) or industries altogether and enroll in a program to get the educational expertise required to make the switch. Other professionals pursue an advanced degree for the financial incentive, whether it be a higher-paying role in their current field or a new career in a more lucrative industry.
These financial benefits can be the deciding factor for prospective students, and with good reason. According to the [Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/data/#?subject=wage-education), graduates of advanced degree programs earn about 25% more than those with just a bachelor’s degree. While differences in salaries vary greatly by industry, location, experience, and other factors, the economic advantages between a bachelor’s and master’s degree are significant enough to inspire many to continue their education.
## Are master’s degrees still worth it?
Master’s degrees can provide a wide variety of benefits, including aiding in career advancement and boosting long-term earning potential. They also provide specialized skills and expertise, making graduates more competitive in their chosen field. In fact, employers in a variety of industries, such as healthcare, education, and business, require or strongly prefer candidates with master’s degrees for specific roles.
Apart from career and financial benefits, master’s programs offer valuable networking opportunities and personal growth. Ultimately, this advancement could open doors to leadership positions or exciting new job opportunities. Pursuing a master’s degree should therefore be based on individual goals, circumstances, and financial incentives.
## Analyzing the best master’s degrees
Many available resources list the highest-paying jobs in the country or an individual industry. As an educational institution, we’ve decided to break the data down even further. By analyzing the degrees that correlate with the highest-paying careers, alongside data on salary and projected job growth, we’ve established a list of the eight master’s degrees with the highest salary potential in America.

### Master of Business Administration (MBA)
A [master’s degree in business administration](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/) takes the coveted first spot on the list of the top eight highest-paying master’s degrees, primarily due to the broad array of concentrations and high-paying careers that recipients of this degree go on to pursue. The annual median starting salary for MBA graduates is [$115,000](https://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/employment-outlook/2021-corporate-recruiters-survey-demand-of-graduate-management-talent), making the pursuit of an MBA a natural choice for those looking to advance in a variety of business-related fields.
