# AI and Information Literacy: Data Visualization
## People in this story
  * [ Brian Ball ](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/faculty/brian-ball/)


**Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant.**
Data and theory visualizations (including animations) are extremely powerful in communicating otherwise dry academic research. This project seeks to develop novel ways of communicating key findings emerging from AI & Information Literacy research currently being conducted under the auspices of Computational Philosophy Lab (CPL) at NU London. This includes research in information sharing via computer simulations (project: PolyGraphs), automating proof construction for the purposes of scientific discovery and education (project: Consilient Reasoning), and mapping AI ethics co-authorship and citation networks (project: Network Analysis of the AI Ethics Field).
The CPL is the UK’s first and premier academic research unit for computationally-enabled and AI-enhanced philosophy. Serving as a London hub for related work within the broader Northeastern University network, and acting as an institutional bridge to Europe, the CPL fosters collaborations with partners to deliver impactful research for academics, policymakers, practitioners, and civil society. Its four main areas of research are: AI Ethics, AI Creativity, AI & Information Literacy and Philosophical Simulations.
