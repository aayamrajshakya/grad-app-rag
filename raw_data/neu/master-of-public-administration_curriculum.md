The Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree program consists of 40 semester hours (SH)
  * 28 semester hours of core courses (7 courses total)
  * 12 semester hours of electives


Full-time students can complete the requirements for graduation in as little as 1.5 years. For those who choose to complete optional cooperative education experience, they will graduate with a total of 41 or 42 semester hours based on the length of the co-op.
All core classes with the MPA curriculum are available online or offline, and students are welcome to move between modalities at their preferred home campus (Boston, Arlington, or Oakland). Both the online and on-campus courses reflect Northeastern University’s high standards for excellence and offer a dynamic, interactive experience.
All online courses are asynchronous, so that students can complete coursework on their own schedules, but all work must be completed by specified deadlines each week.

## Cooperative Education (Co-op)
Co-op is a signature offering of Northeastern’s MPA program. This optional experience allows students to get credit for full-time employment (minimum 32 hours/week) in a role related to public policy.

Throughout the co-op program, MPA faculty and staff are available to mentor students on their work experience.
Students can choose from the two co-op cycles: January–June or July–December. Co-op participants must take a required “[Experiential Integration](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/master-of-public-administration/curriculum/#opt-co-op)” course.
