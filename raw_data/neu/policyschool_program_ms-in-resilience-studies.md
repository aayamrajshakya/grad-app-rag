#  Master of ScienceResilience Studies
This field of studies explores how strategic doctrines, organization processes, bureaucratic behaviors and security tools and tactics are adapting to these challenges by placing greater emphasis on resilience. Resilience is a concept rooted in multiple disciplines that is gaining widespread currency at the community, societal, and global levels given the prevalence of human-made and naturally-occurring threats that do not lend themselves to preventive and protective measures. Strategies for dealing with these threats emphasize measures that mitigate, respond to, recover from, and adapt to risk so as to safeguard essential functions and societal values. Many of these measures involve the role of technologies, system design, and engineering as well as policy, regulatory, and governance issues. Students at Northeastern who enroll in the MS in Resilience Studies will be prepared to inform and support domestic and international efforts to deal with the major sources of turbulence in 21st Century.
