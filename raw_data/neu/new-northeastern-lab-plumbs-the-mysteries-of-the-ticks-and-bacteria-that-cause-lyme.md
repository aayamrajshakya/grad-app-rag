A sign at the entrance to the newly established laboratory of Northeastern University assistant biology professor [Constantin Takacs](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/constantin-nick-takacs/) warns visitors of the tiny menaces that dwell within.
“There are ticks present in the space,” it says. “Do not enter this room without the knowledge and permission of the Takacs lab.”
To make sure the poppyseed-sized black-legged ticks recently arrived from a breeding facility don’t escape, the doorway to the testing room is lined with a white double-sided sticky mat.
