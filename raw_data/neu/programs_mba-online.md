Here, you'll take on projects with classes attached, which emphasizes your decision-making—how you gather and analyze information, whose input you need, and how you influence stakeholders. Very few Online MBA programs can say they offer this.

## Applicant FAQs
Should I use performance-based admissions or the standard application? 
If you're looking for a quicker, more hands-on way to get started, the Fast App (our performance-based admissions option) might be the perfect fit. You'll skip the traditional application process—no essays, no recommendations—and instead, jump right into two MBA courses. Earn a B or better in both, submit your bachelor's degree transcript, and you'll move directly into the full program. It's a great way to prove you're ready by doing the work.
Prefer or require the traditional route? The standard application is for you. You'll submit all your materials up front and, once admitted, you'll be fully matriculated from day one—no need to take the two initial courses first.
