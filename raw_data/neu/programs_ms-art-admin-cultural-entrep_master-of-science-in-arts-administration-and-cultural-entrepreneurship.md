Program overview 
##  Leadership in arts and culture 
The interdisciplinary Master of Science in Arts Administration and Cultural Entrepreneurship prepares arts leaders to both convey the human necessity of creative expression and apply creative thinking to manage resources, inspire audience engagement, and sustain financial support.
Today, traditional institutions for visual and performing arts face critical sustainability challenges. Leaders in the arts must adopt the creative thinking and problem-solving skills of an entrepreneur to envision new models for creative practice, audience engagement, and funding. Arts leaders must also be equipped with the administrative, analytical, and technological skill sets necessary to excel within the complex, interdependent arts ecosystem.
