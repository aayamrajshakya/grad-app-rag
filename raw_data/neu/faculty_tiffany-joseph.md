  * ### Race and Global Human Mobility
#### INTL/SOCL 2500
Examines the relationship between race and the movement of people around the globe.

Ethnoracial-related conflicts connected to migration (i.e., rebellions by the enslaved during the Atlantic slave trade, Rwandan genocide, Syrian civil war) may also be explored.
