2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
We offer cutting-edge expertise in a variety of courses that combine technological advances and business practices. We stress creative and inventive approaches to problem solving, which necessitates empowering students so that they can take charge of their own software projects to become originally productive. Our [information systems program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/academic-departments/mgen/ms-insy/) is as much an art as a science. It bypasses mechanical learning and highlights the value and excitement of engineering thinking that gets things done efficiently as well as imaginatively. We balance theory and practice, on the premise that they are always intertwined and interdependent.
We seek to provide a basic foundation for our students and then seek to push them to new heights to advance their information technology skills in a way that keeps up and, better yet, exceeds the necessarily fast pace of this progressive field. It is not for us just a question of not being left behind; we strive to be at the forefront of software innovation in an effort to transform contemporary society even more radically than technology has already done—to take gigantic strides in business, medicine, education, and security. 
The program offers a wide range of courses that reflect current and future industry trends:
  * Cryptocurrency and Smart Contract Engineering
  * Engineering of Big-Data Systems
  * Business Intelligence and Data Analytics
  * Cybersecurity Engineering and Development
  * Digital Business
  * Full-Stack Software Engineering
  * User Experience Design
  * Data Science and Machine Learning Systems Engineering
