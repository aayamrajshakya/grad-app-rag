Global Co-op
Students can pursue a six-month global co-op in over a dozen countries. New industry and research opportunities for engineering students have been added in such countries as Germany, Singapore, Panama, Tanzania, Italy. Please discuss a global co-op with your [engineering co-op coordinator](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/co-op-coordinators#global) as you formulate your comprehensive co-op program.

Dialogue of Civilizations
The [Dialogue of Civilizations Program](https://geo.northeastern.edu/programs/dialogue-of-civilizations/) is a series of “global student exchanges” between students at Northeastern University and students around the world. Several engineering dialogues are offered—from climate change in India to design and innovation in England. Each Dialogue of Civilizations program has its own eligibility requirements.

Study Abroad
Students can choose to study abroad at a number of different universities throughout the world through the Northeastern-sponsored study abroad program. This experience can be for either a semester or could even be a short-term, faculty-led program. Informational programs are offered to students in the Study Abroad Office in 401 Richards Hall weekly. Past students have studied engineering at such schools as Queens University of Belfast, Ireland, and Swinburne University in Melbourne Australia where a specific curriculum plan has been developed for engineering students.
Engineering students who wish to pursue study abroad should contact their academic advisor.

Student Organizations
The Engineering Without Borders student organization aids communities in developing countries by using engineering solutions to address basic human needs, such as the need for potable water—all the while supplying student members with educational, transformative experiences. Students have traveled to Panama, Honduras, Uganda, and other places.
