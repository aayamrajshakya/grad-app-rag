# Be a Part of Research at Khoury College
Make your mark on the next great innovation as a student or industry partner
Research is an integral part of Khoury College’s mission of CS innovation and leadership. Along all levels of students’ educational journeys — from undergraduate to postdoc — Khoury College provides numerous and varied opportunities for students to play leadership roles in groundbreaking research.
Khoury College also partners with industry leaders as they tackle research projects across a breadth of domains.
## Postdocs: Research fellowships
### Khoury College Research Fellowship Program
If you’re completing your PhD or are at the early stage of postdoctoral training, the Khoury College Research Fellowship Program provides an accelerated pathway to guaranteed tenure-track faculty appointments while allowing you to focus on your research program under the mentorship of Khoury faculty. Specifically, you complete a one- or two-year funded research fellowship and then transition to your tenure-track assistant professor position. The Research Fellowship Program is particularly interested in candidates who understand the experiences of those who are traditionally underrepresented in computing and higher education.

### Khoury College Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowships
A new and distinctive research opportunity for researchers in computer science and adjacent fields who have completed their PhDs and want to launch their independent research career, the Khoury College Distinguished Postdoctoral Fellowship is a unique and prestigious fellowship that offers the chance to pursue research interests with the financial backing of the College. While the fellow will be part of a research group at Khoury College — providing opportunities for collaboration and for initiating new research projects — and will be assigned one or more faculty mentors, they will not have a traditional postdoctoral advisor who directs their research. This model allows researchers the independence, flexibility, and support required to solve the fields’ most complex problems.
