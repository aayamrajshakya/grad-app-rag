## We want to hear from you
The PhD Network, initiated in 2017, grew out of a planning process that took almost two years. Over the coming year, the Network and its opportunities for Northeastern PhD students will grow. As we expand, we want to learn what is important to you. Please submit your feedback by emailing <[[email protected]](https://phd.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)>.
