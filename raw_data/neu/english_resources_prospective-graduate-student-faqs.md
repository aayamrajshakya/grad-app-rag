### Application Questions
Confirmation of Submission
The application system allows you to check the status of your application at any time. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s [Admissions FAQ page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/cssh-graduate-office-admissions-faqs/).
Deadlines
Please see the College of Social Sciences and Humanities’ [Deadlines & Required Materials page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/graduate-admissions/) for application information.
GRE
The GRE is optional for students applying to either our MA in English program, or our PhD in English program.
For those submitting GRE scores, we do not have a minimum score requirement, and we evaluate all parts of the application in the context of the whole. Test scores may be helpful for applicants with little or no experience beyond the undergraduate degree.
Personal Statement
The personal statement is a brief description of your background, your research interests, and your reasons for wanting to enroll in the graduate program. You may include any other information that you feel might be useful, such as prior research experience, teaching/tutoring/editing experience or specific resources/offices/research projects at Northeastern that draw you to the university. For Ph.D. applicants, this statement can also serve as a space to identify faculty you’re interested in working with for your dissertation, though this is not required.
The personal statement should not exceed two pages for the M.A. program or three pages for the Ph.D. program.
PhD and MA (dual application)
If applying initially for the PhD program, you will have the option within the online application to indicate that you are also interested in the MA. You may also include this in your personal statement.
Required Materials
Please see the College of Social Sciences and Humanities’ [Deadlines & Required Materials page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/graduate-admissions/) for application information.
Writing Sample
Writing samples should be academically based and 10-20 pages in length. Creative writing or professional samples may accompany your academic sample, but should not serve as a substitute for it. Ideally your writing sample should reflect your preferred research area.
Letters of Recommendation
The English department requires submission of 3 letters of recommendation. Your letter writers should be able to speak to your academic training or professional skills that prepare you for graduate study. Letter writers typically come from higher education institutions, however, they can be outside of academia as long as they can speak to your character and skills. Ideally, a letter writer should be someone who you have worked with in the last 3-5 years. Please encourage your letter writers to be as specific as possible about how they know you and what qualities your possess.
### Other Questions
Admissions Per Year
Each year, around 10-20 new students enter the graduate programs in English. Approximately 2-4 of those students enter the Ph.D. cohort.
Application Fee Waiver
Students who attend any English graduate recruitment event are eligible for an application fee waiver for our MA or PhD program. Events include the University-wide Open House, the [CSSH Welcome Day](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/welcome-day/), and department-specific program overviews. When you submit your application, please check “yes” in response to the question, “Did you attend an admission event?” Please enter the date of the event and your application fee will automatically be waived.
Cost to Attend

MA/PhD Course Modality
Most courses are taught in-person. Occasionally, we do offer online synchronous courses, but they are not frequent or the standard course modality. Students are expected to be on the ground (on our Boston campus) during the duration of their program.
MA Part-Time Enrollment
Part-time degree completion may be a possibility, but please note this program is not designed to accommodate students working a full-time 9am-5pm job. We cannot guarantee evening availability for courses, and completing the degree as a part-time student may affect your financial aid status. Please reach out to gradenglish@northeastern.edu to discuss your options in further detail.
Summer Courses
At this time, we do not offer summer graduate courses.
