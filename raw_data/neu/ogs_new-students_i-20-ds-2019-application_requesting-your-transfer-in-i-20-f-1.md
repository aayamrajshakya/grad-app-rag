# Requesting Your Transfer-In I-20 (F-1)
##  Who is a transfer student? 
If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. Transfer students must:
  1. Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
  2. Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University


##  Transferring your record 
It is important that you work with the Designated School Official (DSO) at your current school’s international office on the specific process and required documentation needed to complete your transfer-out request. As your current school holds your SEVIS record, you must first start the transfer process there.
After completion of the transfer out process, your current institution will set a transfer release date for your SEVIS record. This is the date that your record will be transferred to Northeastern University. In general, your transfer release date has to be within 60-days from the expiration date on your I-20.
Please be sure to confirm with your current school that your record will be transferred to the correct campus at Northeastern. Campus locations include Boston, Seattle, Silicon Valley, Oakland, Arlington, Portland, Miami, and Charlotte.
Your I-20 form from Northeastern cannot be issued until you complete the required steps of requesting a Transfer I-20 with OGS. In addition, your I-20 cannot be issued until your SEVIS record has been released by your transfer out school to Northeastern.
##  Applying for the transfer I-20 
You can submit a Transfer I-20 request only **after** you have been officially admitted to a full-time program of study.At that time, you will then be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS. OGS encourages you to submit your Transfer I-20 request as soon as possible to provide ample time for the issuance of the I-20 prior to your enrollment.

##  How to prepare and submit an online request: 
###  After confirming your enrollment and completing all required tasks in your admissions portal, you will be able to submit an electronic I-20 request through myOGS.

You are required to confirm your enrollment by following the instructions on your official decision letter, which may include arranging to pay (e.g. by credit card) an enrollment deposit. This transaction is required of all admitted students before they initiate the I-20 process.
2  Complete all required tasks in your admissions portal 
Some students may have additional requirements in their admissions portal that will need to be completed before being eligible for an I-20. If your admissions portal indicates that you must complete a foreign credential evaluation, this must be completed before being eligible for an I-20.
