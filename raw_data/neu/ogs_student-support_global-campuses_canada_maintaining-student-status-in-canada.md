##  Maintaining Student Status in Canada 
###  As a study permit holder, there are a number of conditions you need to meet. If you don’t meet these conditions, you may lose your student status and study permit. You may also have to leave Canada. 
As a study permit holder, you must:
  * be enrolled at a [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLI), unless you’re exempt
  * show you’re actively pursuing your studies, unless you’re exempt by:
    * being enrolled full-time or part-time during each academic semester (excluding regularly scheduled breaks)
    * making progress towards completing your program’s courses
    * not taking any [authorized leaves longer than 150 days](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare-arrival/study-permit-conditions.html#s01.1) from your study program
  * tell IRCC any time you [change post-secondary schools](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools/account.html)
  * end your studies if you no longer meet the requirements of being a student, and
  * leave Canada when your permit expires


You may have other conditions listed on your study permit. You must follow these conditions, which could include:
  * the level of studies
  * if you’re allowed to [work on or off campus as a student](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work.html) in Canada
  * if you need to report for medical procedures
  * if you’re allowed to travel within Canada, and
  * the date you must stop studying.


##  Assessment of Study Permit Conditions 
IRCC Officers should exercise their best judgment and take into account all relevant factors when assessing a student’s compliance with their study permit conditions.
Enrollment at a DLI:
A foreign national who applied for a study permit on or after June 1, 2014, must be enrolled in a [DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html).
Actively Pursuing Studies:
As of June 1, 2014, all study permit holders must actively pursue their course or program of study, while they are in Canada.

##### Frequently Asked Questions
×
####  [ Can I study in a part-time course in Canada? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/maintaining-student-status-in-canada/#collapse-1)
From an Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) perspective, at a minimum, students must have part-time status with their institution to be considered to be actively pursuing their studies. However, one of the eligibility requirements for Post Graduation Work Permit is the student must maintain full-time status in every academic session. Part-time course load may affect the student qualifying forforPost Graduation Work Permit.
####  [ How can I prove that I meet the study permit conditions? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/maintaining-student-status-in-canada/#collapse-2)
IRCC might ask you to prove you’re meeting your conditions, as part of a random check or if they have reason to believe you’re not meeting them. 
IRCC might ask you for the official documents from the university confirming:
  * your enrolment status
  * the reason for and start date of any leave you’ve taken
  * the date you withdrew from a school or study program
  * the date you were suspended or dismissed from a school or study program
  * the date you stopped studying at the school
  * official transcripts
  * references from people who know you
  * proof from a medical professional confirming the medical need for a leave from your study program
  * document confirming your school has closed and no longer offers your study program
  * any other document an officer finds relevant


####  [ What does “non-compliant” mean? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/maintaining-student-status-in-canada/#collapse-3)
Non-compliance with study permit conditions may result in enforcement action; that is, an [exclusion order](http://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/security-securite/rem-ren-eng.html) can be issued for non-compliance, per[Canadian Immigration Law](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-228.html). 
Non-compliance with study permit conditions or engaging in unauthorized work or study may also negatively affect future applications that are made under the IRPA and IRPR. For example, a subsequent study permit or work permit may not be issued until a period of 6 months has passed, since the cessation of the unauthorized work or study or failure to comply with a condition, per Canadian Immigration Law [section R221](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-221.html) and [subsection R200(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).
####  [ What if I take a leave of absence from my studies, how will this affect my status? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/maintaining-student-status-in-canada/#collapse-4)
Students may be required or may wish to take leave from their studies while in Canada. Office of Global Services Canada does not approve or authorize leave of absence. Students who wish to request leave of absence are strongly recommended to familiar themselves with the immigration implications with regard to taking the leave. For the purpose of assessing if a student is actively pursuing their studies, any leave taken from a program of studies in Canada should not exceed 150 days from the date the leave commenced and must be authorized by their DLI.
Examples of reasons for leave include but are not limited to the following:
  * medical illness or injury
  * pregnancy
  * family emergency
  * death or serious illness of a family member
  * change in program of study within the same institution, outside a regularly scheduled break
  * dismissals or suspensions (dependent on degree of severity)
  * postponed program start date (see [Deferred enrollment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html%22%20/l%20%22deferred) for more information)


A student on leave who begins or resumes their studies within 150 days from the date the leave commenced (that is, the date the leave was granted by the institution) is considered to be actively pursuing studies during their leave. If a student does not resume their studies within 150 days, they should do either of the following:
  * change their status (that is, change to [visitor status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay.html) or [worker status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/work-permit.html))
  * leave Canada


If they do not change their status or leave Canada, they are considered non-compliant with their study permit conditions.
Students studying at Northeastern University Canadian campuses are advised to work with their Academic Advisor if they wish to take the leave. They are also advised to keep a copy of any emails/confirmation regarding the authorized leaves that are granted, in case they need it for their PGWP application. 
####  [ What is maintained status? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/maintaining-student-status-in-canada/#collapse-5)
[Maintained status](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html#maintained-status) (formerly called “implied status”) refers to a legal extension of an individual’s immigration status while waiting for IRCC to process an application for a new permit to remain in Canada. To have maintained status, you must submit your application to IRCC for a new permit before your current status expires.
For continuing students, this means that you may be able to continue to study (and [work if eligible](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/working-while-studying/)) beyond your study permit expiration date as long as you applied to extend your study permit before your previous permit expired.
