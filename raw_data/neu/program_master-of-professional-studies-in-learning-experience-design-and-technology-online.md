### What do our Alumni Say?
"Each course in the master's program encouraged me to connect course content and assignments to the real-life learning challenges I face in my full-time role. This marriage of theory and practice required me to assess my current thinking, integrate new theoretical constructs, and appreciate new methodologies. As a result, the learning I gained in the classroom was immediately applicable (and still is!) to the professional role I have outside of it."
"This LXDT program has greatly facilitated me in my career transition. Its’ Skill Building Labs and Experiential Network projects, in particular, provided me with many practical opportunities to put my theoretical knowledge into deliverables, making me more comfortable demonstrating my professional competencies in interviews."
"The discussion board conversations I had with my professor and colleagues helped me engage more deeply with the content, filled in gaps in my understanding, and gave me new ideas for my projects and about my interests within the field as a whole."
"This program prepared me for the current and future realities within the eLearning and instructional design fields. By using the experiential learning opportunities within my coursework, I have created high-quality projects using relevant learning theories, digital course integration, and research based instructional design practices."

Learning and design models provide a solid grounding as students create authentic learning experiences while building skills of immediate relevance to their professional lives.
> - Dr. Elizabeth Mahler, Teaching Professor and Lead Faculty, LXDT Programs
> Our learning design faculty bring serious expertise to their classrooms, but what really sets them apart is their genuine commitment to the learning design field. These aren't just academics in ivory towers—they're seasoned professionals who've been in the trenches across every setting you can imagine. They are learning design experts, master teachers, training pros, and tech leaders who've shaped how people learn in universities, elementary schools, nonprofits, government agencies, and Fortune 500 companies. Mix in some learning scientists who actually understand how brains work, textbook authors who know how to make complex stuff stick, data analysts who can spot what's really working, researchers pushing the boundaries, and strategy experts who see the big picture. What ties them all together? They're genuinely passionate about the field of learning design and in figuring out how to help people learn better, no matter where that learning happens.
