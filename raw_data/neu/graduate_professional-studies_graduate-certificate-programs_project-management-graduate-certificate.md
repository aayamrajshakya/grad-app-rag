2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Technical and managerial employees at all levels of organizations are being asked to manage small and large projects. Many of these professionals have not been specifically trained to effectively and efficiently manage projects. The task of managing projects has its own body of knowledge. This program seeks to provide the practical and theoretical knowledge for which the Project Management Institute tests, and it is expected that individuals who successfully complete this program will be capable of fulfilling the education requirements of the Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam.
This certificate program in project management is designed with sufficient course flexibility to accommodate professionals with various levels of project management experience. Project management principles are applicable to both manufacturing and service industries, including professionals in fields such as software engineering, construction management, and financial services.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
