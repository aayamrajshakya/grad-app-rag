We here in the Center for Student Involvement love nothing more than giving you that extra boost of support that you need to get through your day. During the dark winter months, we invite all graduate and professional students to stop by CSC 240 (the Programming Lab) for free tea and muffins! We offer a wide assortment of caffeinated, decaffeinated, and herbal teas, accompanied by relaxing music as well as a pleasant atmosphere. Whether you want to grab and go or stay for a spell, all are welcome–just be sure to bring your Husky Card. Start your early morning off on a positive note. 
We look forward to seeing you every Wednesday starting at 9:30am in Curry Student Center 240, Spring 2025. Specific dates to be determined. _All tea and pastries are while supplies last._
