Concentrations 
Clinical Nurse Educator 
In many states, nursing registration boards now mandate that clinical nursing faculty and all BSN-prepared instructors serving as clinical faculty must have a minimum of a master’s degree with coursework in education or an education certification. This concentration allows you to meet employer requirements and pursue more advanced roles as a healthcare educator.
Administration/Nurse Executive 
Hospitals and healthcare facilities are looking to enhance the level of leadership and business skills in nurses who serve as nurse managers and departmental directors with unit, team, or service line influence. This interdisciplinary concentration prepares beginner nurse executives to meet the need for healthcare leadership on a unit and departmental managerial level. The concentration provides skills related to fiscal responsibility, budgetary management, communication, and organizational culture within a variety of healthcare settings.
Patient Safety 
Patient safety is integral to healthcare quality and financial viability. While patient safety is the responsibility of all healthcare providers, nurses who are the direct care providers have the opportunity, with an expanded knowledge base, to serve as the leaders and designers of organizational patient safety programming and quality improvement initiatives. This concentration will prepare you to succeed in roles that uphold this critical nursing component.
AI Applications 
Explore foundational concepts of AI and its applications in healthcare, public health, pharmacology, and pharmaceutical sciences. The concentration covers the history of AI, common AI approaches, and state-of-the-art applications across the health sciences. You’ll learn to discern between AI’s capabilities and limitations while examining ethical and regulatory considerations.
Career outlook 
Nursing leaders with advanced degrees are in demand as:
  * Educators
  * Nurse managers
  * Nurse executives and officers
  * Clinical and nursing professors
  * Quality improvement specialists
  * Patient safety innovators
  * Nurse faculty
