#  KarinaSembe
Postdoctoral Teaching Associate, English 
Karina Sembe is a scholar and educator in cultural studies, history, and race and ethnicity studies. She holds a Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies from Boston University. Prior to joining BU, she received a Ph.D. in Literary Studies and worked as a journalist and editor.
Sembe’s work adopts comparative, interdisciplinary approaches to critical theory and area studies, situating its methodological framework at the intersection of history, rhetoric, and cross-cultural criticism. Sembe’s book project, under the working title Making Moves: Upward Mobility and Scripts of Masculinity in the Black Atlantic (1500-1865), investigates upward mobility of the African diaspora as a product of geographic movement and social exchange.
