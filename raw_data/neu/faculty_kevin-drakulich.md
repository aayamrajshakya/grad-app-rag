#  KevinDrakulich
Associate Director and Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice; PhD Program Director; Director of Race and Justice Lab 
Professor Kevin Drakulich’s work is concerned with how Americans think about crime and justice, both within communities and as tied to broader social issues. In this work he has a particular focus on dynamics of race and racism. At the local level, these questions are critical to understanding social processes relevant to crime and justice. More broadly, this work sheds light on the political processes relevant to crime and justice policy. His current work focuses on three broad questions: 1) how context influences perceptions of crime and justice, 2) how perceptions of crime and justice influence political behavior, and 3) how racial and intersectional threat influence perceptions of crime and justice. This work is necessarily interdisciplinary, engaging with the field of criminology, sociology, law and society, and political science. Professor Drakulich is a 2014 recipient of the National Institute of Justice’s W.E.B. Du Bois Fellowship as well as the 2014 New Scholar Award from the American Society of Criminology’s Division of People of Color and Crime. In 2016 and 2023, the students of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice awarded him the Robert Sheehan Excellence in Teaching Award.
