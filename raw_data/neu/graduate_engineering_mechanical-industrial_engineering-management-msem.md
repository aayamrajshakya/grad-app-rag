2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The [Master of Science in Engineering Management](https://mie.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/ms-engm/)offers graduate students an opportunity to develop both technical expertise and business competence that is in high demand among prospective technology-based employers. Industry leaders are seeking qualified and talented individuals who are not only able to guide research and design teams but also able to direct and supervise development and production processes. The combination of technical proficiency and business skills fostered in the engineering management program is designed to provide a competitive edge for graduates seeking a wide range of positions in technology-based product or service industries, as well as in comparable local, state, and federal agencies and programs.
The program was designed by experienced high-level managers and academic leaders as an option for engineers and scientists to broaden their skill sets to include management tools and techniques that are applicable to technology-based industries. Graduates of the engineering management program work as project managers or leaders of teams in technology-based industries. Upon completion of the program, students find that their acquired skills are applicable to a wide range of industries, primarily those focused upon the development of technical products and the management of technical projects.
Graduates may assist companies in bringing a product from an idea through its development phases to its introduction to the marketplace. They may also be involved in forming and managing teams for assessing cost-effectiveness, formulating strategies to improve production, or analyzing a company’s supply chain. Most of these projects cannot be successfully completed without the skills of those possessing a background in management decision making and engineering expertise; therefore, the engineering management graduate is often a technical liaison to all levels of management. As a result, many of the assignments held by engineering management graduates have actually proven to be a gateway to upper-level management positions.
The current program of study can be taken on a part-time or full-time basis on-ground or online. There are four core courses required of all students, which have been formulated to satisfy the foundation requirements of economic decision making, decision-making mathematics, and project management. In addition to these required courses, the curriculum consists of electives that allow students to choose either a broad-based program of study or one centered on a particular concentration. Some students may elect to refresh or enhance their technical skills in engineering-based subjects such as information systems, computer systems engineering, or graduate courses from the traditional engineering disciplines. Other students may prefer to broaden their knowledge base by selecting coursework in management subjects such as engineering organizational psychology, financial management, logistics and warehousing, supply chain engineering, or lean systems design. Additionally, students may also elect to complete the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program as part of their engineering management degree.
One recent graduate has observed that “Northeastern’s MSEM is like an MBA for engineers, with high-quality, dedicated professors who are proficient in their field yet are able to convey information in a way that’s easy to understand.” This graduate also noted, “My courses in project management have been key to understanding the subtleties that affect Project Managers while technical courses provide a strong background in fundamentals as well as specialty topics. My experience with co-op has been outstanding and has truly helped me further my career.”
## General Degree Requirements
To be eligible for admission to any of the MS degree programs, a prospective student must hold a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, science, mathematics, or an equivalent field. Students in all master’s degree programs must complete a minimum of 32 semester hours of approved coursework (exclusive of any preparatory courses) with a minimum grade-point average of 3.000. Students can complete a master's degree by pursuing any of one of the three tracks: coursework option, project option, and thesis option. Specific degree requirements for each of these tracks can be found under the Program Requirements tab. Students may pursue any program either on a full-time or part-time basis; however, certain restrictions may apply.
## Academic and Research Advisors
All nonthesis students are advised by the faculty advisor designated for their respective concentration or program. Students willing to pursue the thesis option must first find a research advisor within their first year of study. The research advisor will guide the students' thesis work, and thesis reader(s) may be assigned at the discretion of their research advisor. The research advisor must be a full-time or jointly appointed faculty. If the research advisor is outside the MIE department, before the thesis option can be approved, a faculty member with 51% or more appointments in the MIE department must be chosen as co-advisor, and a petition must be filed and approved by the co-advisor and the MIE Graduate Affairs Committee. Thesis option students are advised by the faculty advisor of their concentration before they select their research advisor(s). The research advisor and co-advisor must serve as thesis readers.
## Plan of Study and Course Selection
It is recommended that all new students attend orientation sessions held by the MIE department and the Graduate School of Engineering to acquaint themselves with the coursework requirements and research activities of the department as well as with the general policies, procedures, and expectations.
In order to receive proper guidance with their coursework needs, all MS students are strongly encouraged to complete and submit a fully signed Plan of Study to the department before enrolling in second-semester courses. This form not only helps the students manage their coursework, but it also helps the department to plan for requested course offerings. The PS form may be modified at any time as the students progress in their degree programs. 
Students pursuing study or research under the guidance of a faculty member can choose project option by taking Master's Project (EMGT 7945). An MS project must be petitioned to the MIE Graduate Affairs Committee and approved by both the faculty member (instructor for Master's Project) and the student's academic advisor. The petition must clearly state the reason for taking the project course; a brief description of the goals; as well as the expected outcomes, deliverables, and grading scheme.
## Options for MS Students (Coursework Only, Project, or Thesis)
Students accepted into any of the MS programs in the MIE department can choose one of the three options: coursework only, project, or thesis. Please see the Program Requirements tab on the top menu of this page for more information. MS students who want to pursue project or thesis options must find, within the first year of their study, a faculty member or a research advisor who will be willing to direct and supervise a mutually agreed research project or MS thesis. Moreover, students who receive financial support from the university in the form of a research, teaching, or tuition assistantship must complete the thesis option. Students are strongly encouraged to complete 4 semester hours of Master's Project (EMGT 7945)Thesis (EMGT 7990)
Students who complete the thesis option must make a presentation of their thesis before approval by the department. The MS thesis presentation shall be publicly advertised at least one week in advance and all faculty members and students may attend and participate. If deemed appropriate by the research advisor, other faculty members may be invited to serve as thesis readers to provide technical opinions and judge the quality of the thesis and presentation. 
## Change of Program/Concentration
Students enrolled in any of the MIE department programs or concentrations may change their current program or concentration no sooner than the beginning of their second full-time semester of study. In order for the program or concentration change request to be considered by the MIE Graduate Affairs Committee, the student must not be in the first semester of their current program, must have a 3.300 GPA, and have completed at least 8 semester hours of required coursework in their sought program at Northeastern.
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree.
