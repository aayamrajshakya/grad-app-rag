Our expertise in action
## Using AI to transform mobile networking
AI-RAN ALLIANCE
### Problem
Artificial intelligence continues to transform the tech world. But the telecommunications industry remains significantly behind in speed and efficiency.
### Solution
AI-based mobile networking systems could shorten development times, increase data speeds, and enable new mobile experiences for consumers. The newly formed AI-RAN Alliance studies emerging technologies and develops new AI applications. Northeastern, with its unique expertise in radio access network technologies, is the only U.S. university and research institute selected as an alliance founding member.
