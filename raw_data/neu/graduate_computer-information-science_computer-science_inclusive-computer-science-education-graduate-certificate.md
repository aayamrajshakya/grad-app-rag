## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Inclusive Computer Science Education is designed to prepare students to teach computer science principles and concepts in the context of a K–12 environment. Building on the successful Computer Science—Align program, this certificate assumes no prior computer science experience. Through coursework and project-based learning, students have an opportunity to obtain the foundational knowledge necessary to teach basic computing concepts and programming at a variety of educational levels both as stand-alone courses and integrated into other disciplines. The certificate emphasizes how teachers can create an inclusive classroom environment, actively work to dispel stereotypes, and build student confidence. Students who finish this certificate will be well positioned to obtain K–12 certification in computer science.
