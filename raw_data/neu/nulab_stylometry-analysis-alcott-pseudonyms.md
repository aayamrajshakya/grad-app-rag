# Stylometry-based Analysis of Potential Louisa May Alcott Pseudonyms
**Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant.**
Before writing Little Women
First, the project will develop the corpus of texts, very few of which are digitized (early Alcott texts, Gould texts, and contemporary control texts), by turning the nineteenth-century image files of crumbling newspapers into text files. The digitization process itself will enrich the existing nineteenth-century periodical archive. Next, the project will bring to bear stylometric analysis to compare the three groups of stories. The analysis of the digitized texts promises to provide new evidence to suggest whether or not Alcott wrote under this additional pseudonym Gould.
