# Labor, Work, and Occupation
Dramatic changes are occurring in the work lives of people around the world. This field considers the changing experiences of workers in an increasingly globalizing, digitizing, and automated economy. Explores emerging labor markets, as well as how gender, race, and technology shape labor relations, worker autonomy, income inequality, and the types of work people do.
