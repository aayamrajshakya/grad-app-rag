On Thursday, March 28, the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice proudly celebrated the reinstatement of the Omega Epsilon Chapter of Alpha Phi Sigma, the National Criminal Justice Honor Society. After a pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the chapter has been officially re-recognized at Northeastern University.
At this year’s induction ceremony, 29 seniors and 20 juniors were welcomed into the society, recognized for their academic excellence. The event also acknowledged the contributions of SCCJ student workers and celebrated graduating students across undergraduate and graduate programs.
> Although not an easy task, it was a pleasure working with Director Amy Farrell and CJSAC President Giovanni Falco to reinstate this time-honored and esteemed organization showcasing the academic excellence of our SCCJ students. I look forward to the upcoming class/year in not only seeing, but being a part of, all their accomplishments.

SCCJ is excited to see Alpha Phi Sigma grow in the years ahead and continue to foster leadership, scholarship, and community within the field of criminal justice.
