Thinking about earning a doctoral degree in education? One of the biggest decisions you’ll make is choosing between a Doctor of Education (EdD) and a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Education. Each path leads to exciting opportunities—whether you want to transform education through leadership or shape the field through research.
Choosing between an EdD and a PhD is more than just a degree decision—it’s a defining moment in your career. Each program offers unique benefits, whether you aspire to lead organizations or conduct groundbreaking research. By understanding the differences in curriculum, career opportunities, and long-term impact, you’ll be empowered to choose the path that aligns with your goals.
Read on to learn about the defining qualities and key differences between an EdD and a PhD in Education to determine which program is the right fit for you.
## EdD vs. PhD in Education
A Doctor of EducationDoctor of Philosophy in Education, on the other hand, is designed to prepare graduates for research and teaching roles.
“With a PhD, [students are] reviewing the research, seeing a gap in the literature, and generating new knowledge based on a theory or hypothesis,” says [Joseph McNabb](https://cps.northeastern.edu/faculty/joseph-mcnabb/), a professor of practice in Northeastern’s[Graduate School of Education](https://cps.northeastern.edu/academics/schools-centers/graduate-school-of-education/). “Conversely, an EdD student starts with a problem of practice and [works to learn] the skills it will take to resolve that complex problem of practice.”
### Is an EdD better than a PhD?
An EdD is not inherently better or worse than a PhD—it all depends on your career aspirations. If you aspire to lead organizations, implement educational reforms, or solve real-world challenges, an EdD is the better choice because it focuses on practical application and leadership in education, nonprofits, government, and corporate settings.
On the other hand, if you want to conduct academic research, publish scholarly work, or become a university professor, a PhD is the better fit since it emphasizes theory, research, and teaching. Ultimately, the best degree for you is the one that aligns with how you want to impact the field of education.
## What is an EdD degree?
A Doctor of Education is a [professional doctorate](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/professional-doctoral-degrees/) best suited for experienced educators and mid- to senior-level working professionals who want to lead and implement change within their organization.
EdD candidates work in a broad range of fields ranging from K-12 and higher education to nonprofits, government, healthcare, and the military. What each share is a desire to transform their everyday environment and apply the lessons learned through their doctorate to a complex, critical issue facing their workplace. 
The EdD is practice-based. Students in an EdD program don’t want to just research their area of interest, but leverage that research in ways that could positively influence their community or organization’s decision-making process.
