# Graduate Clubs and Organizations
Find your community while furthering your education
Khoury College is home to a wide variety of graduate student clubs and organizations. Groups like the Arlington Explorers’ Society and the Roux Outdoor Club offer opportunities to get outside and explore the unique beauty surrounding Northeastern’s network campuses, while organizations like First Flight Devs give extra support to Khoury students making the leap to grad school. 
> My Graduate Women in Science and Engineering community has given me so much support during some difficult times, reminding me of what I am capable of accomplishing
> Miyuki Gomez, vice president of Graduate Women in Science and Engineering
Through clubs like the Roux Chinese Culture Club and Namaste, students can bond over a shared culture or learn about their peers’ cultures. Graduate students can also find community with other computer scientists who face the same barriers they do, and can collaborate to level the tech industry’s playing field. Organizations like Rainbow NU Seattle, the Graduate Women Coders Club, and Khoury SHEROs of Color focus on axes of oppression ranging from race to gender to sexuality and beyond.
Students can also join groups like the Vancouver Game Developers Guild and the Bay Area Golf Club to work on developing the specific skills and connections they’ll need to become industry leaders. Whatever you want to pursue, you can find like-minded students at Khoury College to help you to take your passion beyond the classroom.
