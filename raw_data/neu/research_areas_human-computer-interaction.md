# Human-Centered Computing at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Bridging the gap between people and technology
Computer science research in human-centered computing focuses on understanding people and designing new technologies that meets their needs. Researchers study how we work with our devices — computers, smartphones, speakers, appliances, and vehicles — and how that work changes when embedded in networks and systems. Such research provides insights about people, technology, and systems that impact how future systems to support work, play, health, and communication are designed.
At Khoury College of Computer Sciences, researchers study how to make such interactions effective, safe, and ethical. This entails developing and testing interfaces, device sensors (for fitness and other apps), data visualization tools, and the digital data that fills our lives.

## Revolutionizing the way we interact with technology
By improving human interaction with computers — making it more intuitive, efficient, enjoyable, and ethical — research in human-centered computing has positive impacts on interfaces, usability, and user experience, including making technologies that are inclusive and accessible to all users. This field also fuels the development of cutting-edge technologies, such as virtual and augmented reality devices and experiences, and is revolutionizing the way we interact with technology. This research also is critical to developing AI agents that have the potential to revolutionize health care, education, and training. 
Ethical and social impacts of human-centered computing are an important area of research as well, addressing such issues such accountability, privacy, security, bias, equity of access, and how to shape policies on the responsible use of computer technology.
## Sample research areas
  * Advanced sensing and natural language processing
  * Automatic detection of human behavior and context
  * Data visualization tools and methods to communicate insight and support new scientific discovery

## Khoury researchers: At the forefront
Timothy Bickmore discusses how his lab’s research aims to increase health care access for patients and decrease the cost of care. Rébecca Kleinberger’s extensive research on voice — both human and animal — aims to “transform otherness into togetherness.” Saiph Savage’s research on the gig economy has at its heart a goal of “reinventing the future of work for [gig and rural] workers.”
Matthew Goodwin discusses his work in developing AI techniques for predicting behaviors in people on the autism spectrum. Alexandra To discusses inclusive game design: “What does it look like to make a game more inclusive from the start?”
## Current project highlights
Accessibility in ability-diverse collaboration 
##  Accessibility in ability-diverse collaboration 
Khoury researchers are investigating how accessibility is created and negotiated within ability-diverse teams in the contexts of collaborative writing, creative making, ideation, and remote work. Some examples of our recent projects include developing auditory techniques for enhancing accessibility in asynchronous and synchronous collaborative writing, an audio-enhanced loom for accessible weaving, and an audio-tactile system for accessible pattern generation. Through our work, we also critically interrogate what roles technologies play in reshaping group dynamics and redistributing the labor of creating access in ability-diverse teams. (PI: Maitraye Das)
The Physical Activity Using Wearable Sensors (PAAWS) study 
##  The Physical Activity Using Wearable Sensors (PAAWS) study 
Accurate measurement of human behavior using devices could significantly advance current knowledge on the dose-response relationships between chronic diseases and behaviors such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. The objective of this project is to develop new algorithms to accurately measure behavior 24/7 using wearable sensors. We are collecting wearable sensor datasets from people as they go about their normal lives, labeling the data second-by-second, and using the labeled data to develop and test new machine learning algorithms that will more reliably detect activities and habits. We aim to help the larger research community perform comparisons between algorithms on realistic datasets of behavior. (PI: Stephen Intille)

Relational Agents Group 
##  Relational Agents Group 
Khoury College’s Relational Agents Group studies and creates computer programs designed to build and maintain long-term, social-emotional relationships with their users, which includes providing mental health care, performing genetic counseling, and helping manage chronic pain. Such agents go beyond just providing information, aiming to build rapport, trust, and engagement with users. This highlights the interdisciplinary nature of HCI, bringing together social psychology, design, and public health, among other disciplines.

Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health 
##  Crowd-Sourced Annotation of Longitudinal Sensor Data to Enhance Data-Driven Precision Medicine for Behavioral Health 
This research investigates if mobile game players can help improve the usefulness of health data collected from wearable devices by adding additional annotations.
Could our clothes be computer interfaces? Khoury faculty research on 4D Fiber Interfaces (the 4th “D” is for time, as these textiles change over time) explore how computer technology could create interactive, responsive, and adaptable materials, such as garments that adapt to different weather conditions.
