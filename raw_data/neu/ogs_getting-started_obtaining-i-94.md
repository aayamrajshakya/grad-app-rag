##  Electronic Arrival Record/Form I-94 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) inspects all foreign national students, scholars, dependents, and visitors to the U.S. arriving at an air, land, or sea border and grants admission to the U.S. in an appropriate immigration classification status (including F-1, J-1, etc). Admission to the U.S. in a specific immigration status is documented via an entry stamp in the passport as well as an electronic or paper Form I-94 arrival record. [Electronic Form I-94 records can be downloaded and printed here.](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
Occasionally when entering the U.S., errors may occur on the passport stamp notation, electronic Form I-94 record, or paper Form I-94 card. These errors must be corrected to ensure that the status of the student, scholar, dependent, or visitor is documented properly and that immigration benefits (such as permission to study or work) are correctly applied.
##  What Should the Form I-94 Say? 
##  How Can I Correct My Form I-94 Record? 
###  There are two ways to correct an I-94 card/record or a passport stamp notation. If you need immediate assistance or if the error was made on your paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp, then you must go in person to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office. However, if your passport notation is correct and the error was made to your electronic Form I-94 record, then you may be able to resolve this matter by e-mail.

[Deferred Inspection](https://www.cbp.gov/about/contact/ports/deferred-inspection-sites) is part of Customs and Border Protection. Deferred Inspection sites provide assistance to individuals at the time of entry or after their entry if an immediate decision was not determined. Typically, this is where F-1 or J-1 students and scholars go when they need to get an I-94 correction or a passport entry stamp.
If you’re based on the Boston campus, to correct an I-94 card/record or passport stamp in person, go to Logan International Airport – Terminal E and look for the Customs and Border Protection Office.

If you are seeking correction to the I-94 card/record, or passport stamp of your dependent spouse or child, then your dependent must accompany you to the Deferred Inspection Office. Your dependent must take all of their original immigration documents with them.
####  [ Option #2: Requesting an I-94 Correction by E-Mail ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/obtaining-i-94/#collapse-33866010-2)
NOTECorrections to a paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp can only be done in person.
However, if your passport admission stamp is correct, and there is an error on your Form I-94 electronic record, you may be eligible to request a correction of your Form I-94 record. Email: [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#caa9a8bae4a8a5b9bea5a4e4a3f3fe8aa9a8bae4aea2b9e4ada5bc)
To request a correction to your I-94 electronic record, send a clear e-mail request to Boston Customs and Border Protection explaining the situation and the correction that is being requested. You will receive a notification telling you that your correction has been made.
