2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’s [Graduate Certificate in Corporate Renewal](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/corporate-renewal-certificate/?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=gccr) is designed to prepare students with the skills and knowledge to reinvent troubled companies. Students develop an agile and strategic mindset—and a portfolio of skills from multiple disciplines.
In just four courses—with the option to take a fifth course to expand their learning—students have an opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of the management and financial issues companies face when they’re in crisis and to build skills to facilitate the process of reinvention and restructuring. They study the essentials of guiding companies through workouts, bankruptcies, liquidations, and restructuring—and help them find success on the other side. Depending on their chosen electives, students explore critical topics in greater depth, such as strategic planning, innovation, and negotiation.
