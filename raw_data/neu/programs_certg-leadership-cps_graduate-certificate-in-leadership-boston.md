Program overview 
##  Become a more strategic leader 
Today’s cross-functional teams and organizations require leaders who capitalize on the collective expertise of the group. The development and mastery of collaborative leadership skills are not typically part of one’s focused discipline preparation, hence leadership requires deliberate development.
The Graduate Certificate in Leadership starts with the premise that everyone is capable of leadership. The program studies every aspect of leadership dynamics, from the leader as an individual to working in teams and the development of strategic leadership techniques. Coursework provides alternative perspectives of leadership, including collaborative models. Using the course’s action-learning methods, participants build a personal model of leadership that they can put to immediate use.
