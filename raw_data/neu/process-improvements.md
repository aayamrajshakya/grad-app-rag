## Process Improvement: an ongoing journey…
NU-RES, along with strategic partners from the Colleges, Human Resources Management, Internal Consulting, and other administrative offices, have created a Process Improvements working group. The mission of the working group is to identify and review issues that span the university, collaborate on improving business processes and tools, and creating new solutions to problems.
The Process Improvements working group meets regularly (quarterly, or sooner if needed) to brainstorm on solutions for issues identified for improvement, bringing the right stakeholders to the meeting to drive an improved solution.
A Northeastern-only listserv discussion group has been created to facilitate effective communication across the different departments that participate in the working group: [[email protected]](https://res.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3e6e4c515d5b4d4d1377534e4c51485b535b504a4d7e52574d4a4d5b4c4810505b4b105b5a4b).
To opt-in to the list, send email to [[email protected]](https://res.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#91e1e3fef2f4e2e2bcf8fce1e3fee7f4fcf4ffe5e2bce2e4f3e2f2e3f8f3f4bce3f4e0e4f4e2e5d1fdf8e2e5e2f4e3e7bffff4e4bff4f5e4) from your Northeastern.edu address (only Northeastern users can opt-into the list) and put the word subscribe in the subject. You will receive an email to confirm the subscription, and once completed, you will receive messages from the list.

  * Payroll Change Distribution (PDC) form/process
  * Effective Communication
  * Research Equipment management
  * Incorrect data entry/system issue causing overpayments on grants
