# PlusOne Programs in CSSH
The PlusOne accelerated master’s program allows you begin master’s study while you are completing your bachelor’s degree, applying up to 16 graduate credits toward both degrees. You will gain early access to advanced courses, have the opportunity to take an additional co-op, and decrease the time to receive your master’s by as much as one year. 
## When Can I Apply?
Speak with your home college undergraduate academic advisor as soon as soon as you think you might be interested in pursuing a PlusOne, and before the end of your third year of studies.
## How do I Apply?
To begin the application process, please complete a [PlusOne Inquiry Form](https://apply.northeastern.edu/register/PlusOne), which will create your initial application profile. After this is submitted, you will receive an email notification from the system to set up your account, and be directed to your PlusOne application to complete and submit. 
Please note that you will be required to submit a signed copy of your [PlusOne Plan of Study Approval](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PlusOne-Plan-of-Study-Approval.pdf) from your Undergraduate Advisor and [CSSH Graduate Program](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/resources/resources-for-new-graduate-students/) Director.
