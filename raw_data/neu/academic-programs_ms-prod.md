## Innovative Curriculum
With a core curriculum of entrepreneurial engineering and product development, you will be prepared with knowledge of the total life cycle product development system, as well as integrating management and (systems) engineering elements to establish the foundation for the systems approach needed to conceive, create, launch, and support products and platforms.
The core courses cover topics such as customer acquisition, technical market analysis, product life cycle, intellectual property, prototyping, iterative development, product design, user testing, and manufacturing.
Considering new product development in a larger framework, you will learn how a venture’s strategy, vision, and core capabilities, coupled with the voice of the customer, combine to determine product strategy, and create best-in-class product portfolios.
Interdisciplinary program.
Flexibility to match career goals.

Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real world engineering challenges. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for Graduate Students. You will have the opportunity to participate in the Sherman Center for Engineering Entrepreneurship Education co-op program, working on a venture for your co-op experience as part of the academic curriculum or to work in industry in a product development role.
## Program Goals
##### Career Outlook
The U.S. technology industry market is estimated at $1.6 trillion in 2021, according to Zippia, with a 6% growth rate. Additionally, job growth for product managers is expected to be similar to managing occupations with a growth rate of 8% between 2019-2029, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Product managers are the fourth highest in-demand job in Silicon Valley and Boston is a high-tech hub of innovation.
