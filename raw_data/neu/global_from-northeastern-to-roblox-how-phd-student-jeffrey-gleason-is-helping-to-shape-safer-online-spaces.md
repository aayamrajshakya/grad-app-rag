How can social platforms reduce harassment and bullying without driving users away? Northeastern Computer Science PhD student Jeffrey Gleason teamed up with Roblox to find out. Their large-scale study of nearly 800,000 users found that longer suspensions not only reduce repeat offenses — they also barely impact user engagement. That balance is hard to strike, and it’s exactly what platforms have long been seeking. Gleason’s research showed that a simple change — extending the length of temporary bans — could significantly reduce the chance of future violations, especially for first-time offenders. Just as importantly, those longer suspensions didn’t result in users leaving the platform. Instead, people returned and re-engaged without repeating the same harmful behaviors. Now implemented at Roblox, these findings are helping to shape more effective, evidence-based moderation strategies — and Gleason hopes other platforms will take note.
