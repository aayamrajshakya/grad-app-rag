## Master's Coursework Option
The Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology offers a full-time or part-time, course-based master’s degree. Classes are generally offered in the evenings to accommodate students who have full-time jobs. A research thesis is not a requirement for the degree.
## Master's Thesis Option
A thesis-based master's option is available only by department approval. Students who wish to pursue the thesis option must have a chemistry and chemical biology tenure-track faculty member willing to serve as their faculty advisor.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
