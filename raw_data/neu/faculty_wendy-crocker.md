## Biography
Dr. Wendy Crocker teaches primarily in the Dissertation in Practice (DIP), the award winning CPED doctoral program. She is the principal instructor for the required EDU 7218 Leadership for Social Justice course where she infuses her Canadian perspective into conversations of equity, diversity, inclusion and belonging. She is a member of the Innovative Teaching and Learning concentration and has recently designed and facilitated both the EDU 7315 Landscape of Teaching and Learning; and the EDU 7316 Designing Transformative Curriculum and Professional Development courses. Dr. Crocker also leads a Doctoral Seminar on Approaches to Curriculum in Early Childhood Education that was co-created with several Northeastern alumni.
As an Associate Teaching Professor in the Graduate School of Education, Dr. Crocker advises Dissertation in Practice (DIP) students whose problems of practice arise from PK-12 settings, early childhood, the military, and Higher Education – areas from which she can draw on her own experiences. 
In addition to advising students’ DIP Action Research studies, Dr. Crocker supervised staged model dissertations. The work of these students draws on other methodologies including: narrative inquiry; case study; and interpretive phenomenological methodologies. Recent successful defenses include:
Dr. Beth Adreon – I have something meaningful to say
Dr. Megan Corazza – The senior year high school experience and transition to college
Dr. Carol Hernandez – I’m not like you, I’m different
