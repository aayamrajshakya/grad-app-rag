#  IlhamKhuri-Makdisi
Associate Professor of History 
Ilham Khuri-Makdisi teaches courses in Middle Eastern history, World history and urban history. She is particularly interested in Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean cities in the late 19th, early 20th centuries and the movements of people and ideas. Professor Khuri-Makdisi is a historian of the late Ottoman Empire focusing on the global and intra-imperial links connecting the Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean to various parts of the empire and the world.
Her first book, The Eastern Mediterranean and the Making of Global Radicalism, 1860-1914 (University of California Press, 2010; paperback 2013), focused on socialism, anarchism, and their various interpretations, as they were expressed by different segments of Beirut, Cairo, and Alexandria’s populations –intellectuals, dramatists, and workers.
She is currently working on a cultural and intellectual history of translations between Arabic and Ottoman Turkish in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, as well as other research projects situating the nahda (Arab Renaissance) within a larger Ottoman and global frame.
