## Study at Northeastern’s Boston campus
The Boston campus offers a traditional American college experience in the heart of this thriving east coast city. Situated in an urban setting, the 73-acre Boston campus is close to the Museum of Fine Arts, Symphony Hall, outdoor spaces like the Boston Common, and Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox baseball team. Reliable public transportation (via the “T” subway system and several bus routes) makes it easy to access other parts of the city.
### Social living
In Boston, you’ll enjoy a welcoming environment with open spaces and a variety of entertainment options. On campus, The Center for Student Involvement and its more than 400 student organizations and clubs provide plenty of social activities, as well as regular campus events.
### Designed for learning
In the university’s Snell Library, you’ll find a variety of technology available, including media creation studios for animation and game design, video conferencing, 3-D printing, and audio/visual recording studios. These spaces can be reserved for individual or group study. The library is open 24/7 and is used by the entire academic community: students, professors, and researchers. At the busiest times, it receives up to 300,000 visits per month.
### Fitness facilities
Northeastern’s Boston campus provides 3 state-of-the-art campus sports centers. You’ll find weight machines, basketball and games courts, running tracks, golf driving ranges, rock climbing walls, and swimming pools.
