## Experiential Learning
Learning extends beyond the classroom at Northeastern. Providing students with opportunities for experiential education that links coursework with the real world is central to the mission both of the University and the Bouvé College of Health Sciences.
Our broad mix of experience-based programs — including co-op, student research, service learning, and global learning — build the connections that enable Bouvé students to transform their lives and gives them valuable opportunities to practice their profession as members of a healthcare team.
The Bouvé College of Health Sciences School of Nursing has an extensive network of top-notch clinical affiliations at health centers, major teaching and community hospitals, and clinics that allow students to engage in clinical experiences covering a wide range of nursing specialties. These include:
  * Adult health
  * Obstetrics and women’s health
  * Pediatrics
  * Behavioral and mental health
  * Public health
  * Management and leadership


## Frequently Asked Questions
### Do students receive a BSN after 16 months?
Yes, students who complete the prelicensure segment (first 16 months) of the program are awarded a BSN degree.
* * *
### **After RN work experience, what options exist for students doing the Master’s?**
After completing the first part of the program and becoming licensed RNs, students can choose to continue to work part-time or full-time as an RN and take courses in the Master’s segment of the program based on their schedules.
Since the program is competitive, to transition seamlessly into a specialty track a student in the pre-licensure portion of the program should maintain a B or better in all undergraduate clinical nursing courses (didactic, lab, and clinical). 
If a grade in any of the courses is below a B, approval and progression is at the discretion of the Specialty Track faculty.
