2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Large streams of data have brought mathematical modeling to nearly every field and industry. More than ever, a deep understanding of the fundamentals and applications of these models is the differentiator between the success and failure of projects in statistics, machine learning, probabilistic modeling, and optimization. From constructing financial tools and optimizing supply chains, to computer-guided brain surgery and to quantum computing, a foundational understanding of advanced mathematics can give you the tools to create the ideas and technology that will drive the 21st century.
A graduate certificate in applied mathematics gives you the opportunity to study the fundamentals of statistical reasoning, mathematical modeling, and modern mathematical methods in a Tier 1 research department. Shorter than the full master's, the graduate certificate allows you to take up to four courses from the Department of Mathematics. Our courses cover a wide range of topics, from theory courses about the fundamental structures of mathematical objects, to project-based applied courses where students use modeling to solve research-level problems from academic and industry partners.
All applied mathematics courses are taught in the evening to accommodate working students. Mathematics and pure math courses also count toward this certificate.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
