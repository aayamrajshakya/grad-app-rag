#  LilySong
Assistant Professor of Race and Social Justice in the Built Environment 
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Arts, Media and Design 
Lily Song is an Assistant Professor of Race and Social Justice in the Built Environment at Northeastern University. She holds a PhD in Urban and Regional Planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MA in Urban and Regional Planning from the University of California — Los Angeles, and BA in Ethnic Studies from UC Berkeley.
Song’s research interests lie at the nexus of race, class, and gender politics of space; infrastructure-based mobilizations and experiments; and reparative planning and design in American cities and other decolonizing contexts.
Prior to coming to Northeastern, Song was a Lecturer in Urban Planning and Design at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, where she was Founding Coordinator of Harvard CoDesign.
From 2013-2015, Song was a Provost Fellow at University College London, where her postdoc research informed urban infrastructure planning and governance with “informality” in the decolonizing, multiethnic, climate vulnerable Indonesian context.
