## Overview
The Master of Science in Semiconductor Engineering is an interdisciplinary, cutting-edge program offered by the Institute for NanoSystems Innovation, College of Engineering, and D’Amore-McKim School of Business. The program prepares students through interdisciplinary knowledge and experimental tools to meet the new needs of semiconductor companies to fill the talent gap for careers in this rapidly evolving in-demand industry.
The talent profile of semiconductor companies has changed and conventional single-discipline degrees are not sufficient to support these new needs. There is an industry need for skilled engineers to design chips, discover new materials and manufacturing methods, develop software tools for the design and operation of new chips, and to design advanced manufacturing tools to make these chips.

## Program Goals
Career Outlook
Given the landmark CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, a significant share of new chip manufacturing capacity and R&D is expected to be located in the U.S. The Semiconductor Industry Association projects that the semiconductor industry’s workforce will grow by nearly 115,000 jobs by 2030, from approximately 345,000 jobs in 2024 to approximately 460,000 jobs by the end of the decade, representing 33% growth. 80% of projected new technical jobs risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates. Of the unfilled jobs, 35% will be engineers or computer scientists with four-year degrees; and 26% will be engineers at the master’s or PhD level.
