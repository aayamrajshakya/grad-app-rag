Program overview 
The Master of Science in Health Informatics/Master of Public Health dual-degree program prepares graduates to lead healthcare at the nexus between public health and health informatics. Graduates of this program will benefit from having a greater understanding of public health issues along with knowledge and skills in information science, business management, and healthcare.
Recognizing the increasing overlap between health informatics and public health with a focus on urban health, the dual HINF/MPH program allows coursework that is in both the public health and health informatics curricula to be counted toward both degrees, reducing tuition costs and saving one year of study compared to obtaining both degrees individually.
