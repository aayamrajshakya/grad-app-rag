## Bringing experience to entrepreneurship
Northeastern’s signature experience-based learning opportunities, like co-ops and real-world research, go hand in hand with Oakland’s long history of entrepreneurship. Here, you’ll not only learn how to make an impact in your industry—you’ll also put that learning into action every day alongside our local business partners. In fact, more than 1,400 graduate co-op students have been hired by tech giants like Meta, PayPal, and Toast, while 1,250 Oakland-based nonprofits are waiting for you to help solve pressing issues.
Upon graduation, you’ll have the skills you need to start your own business, help a nonprofit make a difference, or shepherd a global enterprise through its next chapter. And you’ll have a robust network of peers and professionals in the Bay Area and beyond to help you every step of the way.
##  What makes Oakland unique 
As one of the United States’ largest metro areas, Oakland is both a key part of the Bay Area and a strong cultural presence in its own right.
