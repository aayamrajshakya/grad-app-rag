2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Human-centered informatics (HCI) focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of IT systems with a particular emphasis on the relations and interactions between people and IT systems. The emphasis of understanding users experience when they interact with technology in the information-rich environment and the design of interfaces between users and systems makes it different from the focus of software engineering programs or visual and artistic design programs.
The human-centered informatics graduate certificate offers students the opportunity to learn the theories of cognitive and social psychology as well as universal principles of design adopted in human-computer interaction. Students develop the technical skills to study user experience in various IT environments (home, business, social media, healthcare, etc.), focusing on user needs, information architecture, and design of user interfaces. Successful students that graduate with the HCI graduate certificate will be able to propose innovative or improve design solutions to real-world problems.
