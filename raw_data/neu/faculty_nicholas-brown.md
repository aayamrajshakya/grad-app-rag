#  NicholasBrown
Associate Teaching Professor of Urban Landscape and History 
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Arts, Media and Design 
Nicholas Brown teaches in the Urban Landscape Program and the Department of History at Northeastern University. He holds a PhD in Landscape Architecture (History & Theory) from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, a MFA degree from UIUC’s School of Art & Design, and a BA from Carleton College. Previously Brown taught in the American Indian & Native Studies Program and the Department of Geographical and Sustainability Sciences at the University of Iowa.
Weaving history, theory, and practice together in the classroom, Brown works with students to better understand relationships between social justice and the built environment. Using place-based pedagogies, he encourages students to experiment with techniques for activating histories and spaces. Recent projects designed in collaboration with students include: [A People’s Guide to Firsting and Lasting in Boston](http://firstinglastingboston.tumblr.com/), which documents the “erasure” of indigenous peoples in and around Boston, and [Ioway City](http://iowaycity.tumblr.com/tour), a walking tour that explores Native American histories and ongoing presence in Iowa City.
