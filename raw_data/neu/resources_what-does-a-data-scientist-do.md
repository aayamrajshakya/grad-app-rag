## Data scientist role and responsibilities
Data scientists work closely with business stakeholders to understand their goals and determine how data can be used to achieve those goals. They design data modeling processes, create algorithms and predictive models to extract the data the business needs, and help analyze the data and share meaningful insights with peers. While each project is different, [the process for gathering and analyzing data](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analysis-project-lifecycle/) generally follows the path below:
1. Ask the right questions to begin the discovery process.
2. Acquire data.
3. Process and clean the data.
4. Integrate and store data.
5. Begin initial data investigation and exploratory data analysis.
6. Choose one or more potential models and algorithms.
7. Apply data science techniques, such as machine learning, statistical modeling, and artificial intelligence.
8. Measure and improve results.
9. Present final result to stakeholders.
10. Make adjustments based on feedback.
11. Repeat the process to solve a new problem.
## Common data scientist job titles
The most common [careers in data science](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-science-careers-shaping-our-future/) include the following roles:
  * Data scientists: Design data modeling processes to create algorithms and predictive models, and perform custom analysis
  * Data analysts: Manipulate large datasets and use them to identify trends and reach meaningful conclusions to inform strategic business decisions
  * Data engineers: Clean, aggregate, and organize data from disparate sources and transfer it to data warehouses
  * Business intelligence specialists: Identify trends in datasets
  * Data architects: Design, create, and manage an organization’s data architecture


Although the roles of data scientists and [data analysts](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/what-does-a-data-analyst-do/) are often conflated, their responsibilities are actually quite different. Put simply, data scientists develop processes for modeling data, while data analysts examine data sets to identify trends and draw conclusions. Because of this distinction and the more technical nature of data science, the role of a data scientist is often considered to be more senior than that of a data analyst; however, both positions may be attainable with similar educational backgrounds.

## Are data scientists in demand?
By many accounts, becoming a data scientist is a highly desirable career path. It is routinely ranked one of the best jobs in the U.S. based on median base salary, the number of active job openings, and employee satisfaction rates. Likewise, Harvard Business Review called data science “[the sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century),” noting that “high-ranking professionals with the training and curiosity to make discoveries in the world of big data” are in major demand. 
From startups to Fortune 500 companies to government agencies, organizations are seeing the value in capitalizing on big data. Google’s Chief Economist Hal Varian spoke about the need for data scientists back in 2009, telling [McKinsey Quarterly](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/hal-varian-on-how-the-web-challenges-managers?reload), “the ability to take data—to be able to understand it, to process it, to extract value from it, to visualize it, to communicate it—that’s going to be a hugely important skill in the next decades.”
According to the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, [employment of all computer and information research scientists is expected to rise 23% by 2032](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm)—a rate of increase that exceeds many other professions. Yet data scientists are relatively scarce, meaning it’s now an opportune time to upskill and enter the field.
