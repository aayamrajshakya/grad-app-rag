Concentrations 
Biomedical devices and bioimaging: 
Career outlook 
Bioengineering is a growing sector of the engineering profession. The aging of the U.S. population and the nationwide focus on health issues will help drive demand for better medical devices and equipment designed by biomedical engineers. Additionally, an increased concern for cost effectiveness will boost demand for biomedical engineers, particularly in pharmaceutical and device manufacturing and related industries.
Employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers is projected to grow 7% from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations. The median annual wage for bioengineers and biomedical engineers was $100,730 in 2023. (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics)
Unique features 
  * Interdisciplinary program draws on the expertise from core faculty in bioengineering and affiliated faculty from across Northeastern
  * Extensive research at an R1 institution and experiential learning opportunities
  * State-of-the-art labs and research centers/institutes
  * Collaborations with major hospitals, industry, and government
  * Top-ranked cooperative education program to gain up to eight months of professional experience as part of the curriculum
