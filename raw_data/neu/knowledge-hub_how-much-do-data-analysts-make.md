In our modern world, one of the most constant and relied upon sources of information is data, and for good reason: data is everywhere. Every action we take, both on- and offline, generates a [mind-blowing amount of data](https://www.statista.com/topics/1464/big-data/#dossierKeyfigures) that governments and corporations collect and analyze to better understand and inform why and how we do what we do.
In fact, experts now predict that more than 150 zettabytes of data (the number 150 followed by 21 zeros, for context) will need analysis by 2025, creating thousands of data analytics jobs within a wide range of industries.
With so much information now available, it’s no surprise that data analysts are in high demand and, in turn, earning a salary that matches the growing needs of today’s employers. These individuals hold the key to unlocking insights and predicting trends that businesses and governments can use to become more profitable, efficient, anticipatory, and intelligent.
Read on to explore the role that data analysts play within the organizations that employ them, the salaries associated with this title, and the steps that you can take today to kickstart a career in this promising field.
## What Do Data Analysts Do?
Simply put, [a data analyst’s job](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/what-does-a-data-analyst-do/) is to interpret data and then turn that data into a story. Data analysts turn large volumes of data into insights that organizations can use to make smarter business decisions. They work across a wide range of industries—from healthcare and education to retail and the government—collecting data and looking for patterns within that data to uncover trends that can be used to [make decisions and recommendations](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-driven-decision-making/).

According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the overall goal of data analytics is to develop approaches for analyzing large data sets that are both reproducible and scalable. Being able to use and analyze a variety of sources helps data analysts cross-reference information so that they can provide a more holistic view of all data points. As they uncover and share insights, data analysts focus on improving their own systems to make communicating future insights easier.

## The Power of Data Analysts
Data analysts work across organizations, helping leaders decide how to distribute resources, [manage their supply chain](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-science-supply-chain-management/), create production schedules, and set prices.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics uses the aviation industry as one example of the impact data analysts can have. When determining how much to charge customers for tickets, data analysts might consider the number of cities flights have to connect to, the amount of fuel it takes to fly between those cities, the expected number of passengers, and any maintenance costs.
Data analytics is also used to improve order fulfillment, service level performance, and customer value. Michael Chapin, CEO of e-commerce floral company [FromYouFlowers](https://www.fromyouflowers.com/), shared his experience using data in business [with Inc](https://www.inc.com/gordon-tredgold/7-ways-data-analytics-can-boost-your-business-growth.html), explaining how his organization used it to predict customer demands and make time-sensitive decisions.
Another common use of data in the commerce industry is the identification of which customers are most likely to become repeat clients. By analyzing purchase history and frequency, organizations can make educated decisions about developing long-term relationships with the customers who are most likely to continue to conduct business with them over time.
