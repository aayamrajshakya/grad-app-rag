## Bring your learning to life
For over a century, Northeastern has led the way in experience-based learning. Our experiential learning opportunities allow you to work with leading organizations and apply the knowledge and skills you learn in the classroom to real-world scenarios. Whether you are a recent undergraduate, a professional looking to switch careers, or a leader angling for that next promotion, the industry experience and practical skills you’ll gain at Northeastern will give you a competitive edge in the workforce.
### Experiential learning in the classroom
Experiential learning begins in the classroom, where faculty provide real-world learning opportunities in their lessons and curriculums. In each class, you’ll learn from faculty members who have years of experience in their fields—most of whom are still working within their industries as they teach. They’ll share expert insights on current industry trends, provide mentorship and support as you advance your career, and help you draw stronger connections between your studies and the real world.
Coursework can include case studies, experience-based projects, discussions, and scenario-based simulations of professional experiences, in addition to other activities. In laboratory settings, you’ll work with cutting-edge technologies and techniques to solve 21st-century challenges with skills that transfer into growing careers. Many courses finish with a capstone, thesis, dissertation in practice, or another culminating assignment that lets you dive deeply into a topic of personal importance while drawing on all of your new skills and experiences.
