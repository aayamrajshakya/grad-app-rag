#  Kathleen CoyneKelly
Professor of English 
Kelly’s research follows three paths that often cross, and cross-fertilize: 1) The literature and culture of the Western European Middle Ages, with two foci: the romance, and eco-theoretical readings of medieval texts; 2) The afterlives of the Middle Ages: since the early modern period, the Middle Ages has been continuously invoked and imitated as well as idealized and distorted, resulting in both problems and pleasures; 3) Environmental Humanities and Environmental History, with a focus on literary and visual representations of landscape and anthropogenic change.
Kelly is finishing a book on Thoreau’s Journal drawings, which she sees as integral to his growth as a nature writer. Moreover, attending to the drawings is one way to shift our attention from readinglookingat[Thoreau’s Journal Drawings](https://thoreaudrawings.northeastern.edu/)). The Shop at Walden Pond sells her [field notebook](https://www.shopatwaldenpond.org/product_p/216645403346.htm) (with a brief introduction to the genre of field notes) featuring Thoreau’s drawings.
In collaboration with three other medievalists, she is also finishing a book on heritage tourism—with a focus on place, history, and invented history—connected to so-called Arthurian sites in the U.K., Germany, and the U.S.
Kelly’s medieval scholarship has appeared in AllegoricaArthuriana,AssaysThe Chaucer ReviewELNExemplariaParergon, postmedieval Studies in PhilologyThe Year’s Work in Studies in MedievalismPerforming Virginity and Testing Chastity in the Middle Ages  A. S. ByattMenacing Virgins: Representing Virginity in the Middle Ages and Renaissance; Queer Movie MedievalismsChaucer on Screen: Absence, Presence, and Adapting the Canterbury Tales.
She serves as Editor of [The Concord Saunterer](https://thoreausociety.org/reading-room/the-concord-saunterer/), the Thoreau Society’s peer-reviewed journal featuring essays about Thoreau, his times and contemporaries, and his continuing influence.
