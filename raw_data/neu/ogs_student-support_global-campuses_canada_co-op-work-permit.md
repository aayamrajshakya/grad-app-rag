A co-op work permit allows students to work full-time during regular academic terms.You must have a co-op work permit and a [Social Insurance Number](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/social-insurance-number/) before you start your co-op. You also need to meet the college co-op program criteria before you may start your co-op.
**You may apply for a co-op work permit****in two ways****:**
  * With your initial Study Permit (recommended) 
    * You may upload your POA document as your “School Letter” to the IRCC portal. You may be given a Co-op permit at the border with your Study Permit.


  * In Canada after you receive your Study Permit approval and have started your program.
    * It is a free application, and you may contact the international student advisor to request a School Letter to support your application.Please allow time for processing.
    * It is recommended to apply for a co-op work permit at least 3-4 months before your co-op term starts. 


You may not start your co-op position without a valid co-op work permit. In Canada, you also need a [Social Insurance Number](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/social-insurance-number/) to work.
