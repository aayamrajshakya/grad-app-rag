## Required human subject research training
Under the direction of the [Office of the Vice Provost for Research](https://research.northeastern.edu/contact/), Northeastern University requires completion of training on the protection of human subjects and the ethical principles of research for all human subject research (HSR), regardless of whether or not investigators have received funding to support their project. This training is mandatory for all faculty, staff, and students who conduct/supervise HSR whether on campus or off-campus.
Northeastern has an account with [CITI](https://about.citiprogram.org/), who offers human subject training. All NU affiliates can take this course at no charge. Please note that training is valid for 3 years at NU. Those who continue to be engaged in HSR will be instructed to complete a refresher course. Any training that was completed more than 3 years ago will not satisfy NU IRB training requirements. If you completed this training at another institution, within the 3-year period, simply go into your CITI account and indicate you are now an NU affiliate. The NU IRB will consider accepting alternative training on a study-by-study basis.
The Department of Human Research requires completion of the training module titled CITI Human Subjects Research Stage 1 Basic Course. Note that the Responsible Conduct of Research trainings do not satisfy IRB training requirements.

When you submit a study for review, you will need to include your Human Subjects Research course completion date.
## Training Option for Community Researchers
Non-Northeastern researchers who are being added to a non-exempt study via an Individual Investigator Agreement (meaning they are not affiliated with another research institution who has an IRB – most often this applies to community members who are collaborating with NU research teams) may complete the CIRTificationEnglish and Spanish
Collaborating researchers will need to keep their CIRTification training “current”, meaning having completed the initial training and/or the refresher within the last 3 years. Please see the CIRTification website for details on how to complete the refresher course. To add CIRTification to our study team form, please check “Required CITI Training” and in the checkbox, list “Alternative CIRTification training completed on <insert completion date>”.
