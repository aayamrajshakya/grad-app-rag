Professor of Environmental Science and Public Policy 
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, College of Science 
Brian Helmuth holds a joint appointment between the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs and the Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences, based at Northeastern’s [Marine Science Center](http://www.northeastern.edu/cos/marinescience/) in Nahant. His [research and teaching](http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/) focus on predicting the likely ecological impacts of climate change on coastal ecosystems, and on the people who rely on them for their well-being. His lab applies a wide range of approaches, including the development and deployment of [novel sensors](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/robotic-mussels-climate-change.html), physiological and ecological experimentation to measure the vulnerability of key marine organisms, and the mapping of these vulnerabilities to inform [marine spatial planning](https://academic.oup.com/conphys/article/7/1/coz028/5548920?login=true). He works collaboratively with the Cognitive Laboratory of Environment and Arts Research, [a team of psychologists, architects, and visual artists](https://clear.northeastern.edu/) to explore how people perceive the world around them, and how this influences their [engagement in conservation](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-445X/10/12/1293). His lab also works closely with informal educators such as the [Museum of Science, Boston](https://www.mos.org/node/24437246) to explore climate adaptation strategies using [community scientists](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/1548beb5360e48648a43a595239fe3c5).
The [Helmuth lab](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/About/Advisory-Board) works collaboratively with other scientists from across the globe in places such as [Argentina](https://marinebon.org/p2p/); [China](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yunwei-Dong-2); [Hong Kong](http://www.swims.hku.hk/); [Iraq](https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/01/15/saddam-hussein-destroyed-the-biblical-eden-this-cross-cultural-partnership-could-restore-it/); [Israel](https://www.rilovlab.com/); [Italy](http://www1.unipa.it/gsaralab/en/home-2/); [Portugal](http://www.coastalwarming.com/en/norterocks/); and the [U.K.](http://www.mba.ac.uk/fellows/nova/) He serves as a science advisor to ocean explorer [Fabien Cousteau](https://www.fabiencousteauolc.org/), and is deeply involved in his efforts to build [Proteus](https://www.fabiencousteauolc.org/proteus), the [International Space Station of the Ocean](https://www.forbes.com/sites/katiejennings/2020/07/22/fabien-cousteau-is-raising-135-million-to-build-the-international-space-station-of-the-deep-sea/?sh=579d9ec11013). Helmuth currently serves as an author on the [5th US National Climate Assessment](https://www.globalchange.gov/nca5), and is past Chair of the[ National Sea Grant Advisory Board](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/About/Advisory-Board).
