#  PhDCriminology & Justice Policy
### A research-oriented and practice-oriented doctoral program.
The doctoral program in Criminology and Justice Policy is student-centered with the goal of preparing students for academic careers as well as careers in research and policy development. Students of this full-time, fully-funded Ph.D. program complete the degree in five years on average. Through our curriculum, students learn the process of research from the ground-up.

Additionally, Ph.D. students are offered several benefits throughout their studies, including:
  1. Possibilities for generous, full-year funding packages
  2. Extensive summer research opportunities
