## Financial Aid
Graduate students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to be considered for all available federal funding. You may file the FAFSA beginning October 1. While the FAFSA may be submitted beyond the priority filing deadline, the federal processor must receive your FAFSA by that date so you can be considered for all funds you may be eligible to receive. 
Northeastern University FAFSA School Code
For more information, [visit the FAFSA website](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa/). You can also find more information on financial aid on our [Student Financial Services](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/) website.

The Post-9/11 GI Bill provides financial support for education and housing to individuals with at least 90 days of aggregate service after September 10, 2001, or individuals discharged with a service-connected disability after 30 days.
To determine your eligibility, [visit the VA website](https://www.va.gov/) or contact the Veterans Affairs Regional Office at 888.GI.BILL.1 (888.442.4551). GI Bill benefits are determined and paid solely by the Veterans Affairs Regional Office.
