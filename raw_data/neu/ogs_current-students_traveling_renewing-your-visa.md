#  Students Studying in The United States 
Depending on the length of your academic program and duration of your visa, the F-1/J-1 visa in your passport may expire during your program at Northeastern University. An expired visa has no impact on your legal status in the U.S. and is not needed to complete your NU degree. If your F-1/J-1 visa expires, you will only need to renew the visa if you decide to travel internationally during the remainder of your academic program and/or the duration of your OPT/STEM Extension or Academic Training. Please see below for guidance on the visa renewal process, understanding that visa renewal is discretionary and does carry risk of delay or denial. 
##  Visa Interview Appointments Must Be Scheduled in Country of Residence or Nationality 
###  Effective September 6, 2025, all applicants for F/J nonimmigrant visas must schedule their visa interview appointment at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country of nationality or residence.

##  Visa Expiration 
The F-1/J-1 visa in your passport is an entry document –it must be valid on the day that you are attempting to enter the U.S. You are allowed to remain in the U.S. after the F-1/J-1 visa expires, as long as you are actively maintaining your F-1/J-1 status and have a valid I-20/DS-2019. For example, if you are approved for an I-20/DS-2019 program extension, but your F-1/J-1 visa has expired, you are eligible to remain in the U.S. with the valid I-20/DS-2019. 
**Because the F-1/J-1 visa does not determine your eligibility to remainin the U.S., once you have arrived in the U.S., it is not needed to continue and complete your program of study. As such, it is not recommended that you travel****for the sole purpose of renewing your F-1 /J-1visa as delays could impact academic progress if you are unable to return to campus to resume on-ground, full-time enrollment. **
##  Visa Renewal Location 
**You cannot renew your F-1/J-1 visa from within the U.S. You can only renew your F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate outside the U.S. in your country of residence or nationality.**[**You can find a list of U.S. Embassies/Consulates abroad here**](https://usembassy.gov/)**.**
Please also remember to always register your international travel during your academic program with the [Global Safety Office Travel Registry](https://globalsafety.northeastern.edu/travel-registry/).
###  Submission of DS-160: Online Nonimmigrant Visa Application 
May 9, 2025: All visa applicants are strongly advised to submit their DS-160 form at least two business days before their scheduled visa interview. 
##  NEW: Online Presence and Social Media and Visa Renewal Applications 
###  Updated June 23, 2025 
The U.S. Department of State (DoS) has announced expanded vetting of “online presence” for all F and J visa applicants, including students and exchange visitors. As part of this consular process, applicants are required to:
  * Disclose all social media identifiers on the DS-160 visa application
  * Set their social media profiles to “public” for consular review


Media reports based on a cable from the Secretary of State indicate that consular officers will be required to review applicants’ online presence for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States”. Reports also state that that consular officers should flag “advocacy for, aid or support for foreign terrorists, and other threats to U.S. national security” and “support for unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence”.
You can [review the DOS announcement here.](https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/06/announcement-of-expanded-screening-and-vetting-for-visa-applicants/)
Note: OGS continues to advise that current students, scholars, and alumni on OPT/STEM/AT do not travel for the sole purpose of visa renewal.
##  Visa Renewal Process 
###  The process of renewing your visa is similar to the initial visa application process you completed before arrival. As the process and requirements may vary from one Embassy to another, you will need to contact the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the country of application for detailed application questions. For more details about the visa application process, please review the "F-1 Student Visa Process" or "J-1 Student Visa Process" page under the "Current Students" section of the OGS website. 
####  [ Important Note about Visa Renewals ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/#collapse-58147419-1)
Please note that receiving an initial F-1/J-1 visa does not guarantee that your visa will be renewed in the future. Each visa application is reviewed independently, and renewal decisions are based on the standards in place at the time of application. It is important to stay informed about any changes to visa adjudication policies, especially as standards may evolve under different administrations.

##  Visa Application Outcomes 
###  Please note that if you are a current student and your attempt to renew your visa prevents you from returning to the U.S. to resume classes, you may be advised to seek a leave of absence. 
####  [ Approval ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/#collapse-58195204-1)
Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you.
####  [ Denials ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/#collapse-58195204-2)
214(b) Denial
Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country—such as family, job, education, or property—indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT).
The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial.
If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial.
PP 10043 Denial
On May 29, 2020, a [Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-12217/suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-students-and-researchers-from-the-peoples-republic) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected.
Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations.
If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance.
Students should review the [Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html) for more information and guidance about visa denials.
####  [ Administrative Processing ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/#collapse-58195204-3)
Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. 
The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative ProcessinginternalPlease note that this is not a visa denial.
If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or [submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal.](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs?_gl=1*n2cufc*_gcl_au*MTk2OTMxMTcxMy4xNzE4NjI5NjM2) You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance.
What is “Administrative Processing”?
After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including:
  * Social media review
  * Your country of birth or citizenship
  * Academic or employment history, including military experience
  * Travel history
  * Source of funding
  * Past U.S. immigration records
  * Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history
  * Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence
  * Geopolitical factors


These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields.
Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa.
Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process.
If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment.
Next Steps During Administrative Processing
If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process.
Please refer to the [Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/administrative-processing-information.html) for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.
##  Replacing a Lost or Stolen F-1/J-1 Visa 
It is recommended that F-1/J-1 students make photocopies of all their immigration documents (including passport and F-1/J-1 visa). If your passport containing the F-1/J-1 visa is lost or stolen, please file a police report immediately by either going to a local police station or [contacting NUPD](https://nupd.northeastern.edu/contact-us/how-to-reach-nupd/). You should then report your passport/visa lost or stolen to the local Embassy/Consular section of your country of citizenship in the U.S., requesting a new passport (if you have no other valid passport) and to the U.S. Embassy/Consular section which issued your F-1/J-1 visa originally. 
It is not possible to replace a lost or stolen F-1/J-1 visa in the U.S. However, if you still have a valid passport or have submitted a request to replace your passport, and you have a valid I-20/DS-2019, you may remain in the U.S. even with the lost F-1/J-1 visa. If you travel internationally, you will need to renew the F-1/J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad to return to the U.S. When applying for the replacement visa, you will need to provide a copy of the police report and written documentation about the loss of your passport and visa.
Please see the [U.S. Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/lost-stolen-visas.html) for more guidance.
##  Travel to Canada, Mexico, or U.S. Adjacent Islands 
If you travel to Canada, Mexico, or one of the [islands adjacent](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/travel) to the U.S. (other than Cuba) for less than thirty days with your valid passport, a valid form I-20 or form DS-2019, and your most recent [form I-94](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home), you may be eligible to travel with an expired F or J visa. This process is known as [automatic visa revalidation](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-expiration-date/auto-revalidate.html#ExternalPopup). However, you must meet certain conditions in order to be eligible for automatic visa revalidation. Please visit [the U.S. Customs and Border Protection](https://cbpcomplaints.cbp.gov/s/article/Article-1446?language=en_US) and [the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/travel) for more information on eligibility.
