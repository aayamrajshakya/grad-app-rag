Program overview 
##  Expertise in behavior analysis 
The MS in Applied Behavior Analysis program fulfills the behavior-analytic coursework requirements for pursuing BCBA pathway 2 eligibility.
This program prepares graduates to become behavior analysts, serving in supervisory and consultant roles within schools, agencies, hospitals, and other organizations that seek to apply behavioral science to improve socially significant behaviors.

Students are provided with the option of additional coursework to gain hours toward supervised fieldwork experience required by the Behavioral Analysis Certification Board (BACB).

Program benefits 
  * Primarily asynchronous with occasional synchronous meetings allows students to complete their degree in a way that works for their life and commitments.
  * Choose how to accrue your fieldwork hours as required by the BACB.
  * Study at one of the first universities to offer a master’s degree in applied behavior analysis.
  * Learn from faculty and leaders with influential articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals and extensive ongoing clinical experience.
  * This program offers the flexibility to apply understanding of behavior principles in areas not typically included in behavior analysis curricula, including sustainability, gerontology, and health and fitness. You can also add optional coursework in building supervisory skills.
  * In conjunction with the experiential learning classes, students complete a scholarly project across two semesters in which they either develop and complete a research project or a literature review of a topic of importance in the field of applied behavior analysis.
  * Build a professional network that allows you to continue your development with colleagues working in leadership positions around the globe.


Fieldwork opportunities 
The experiential learning courses that are required for matriculation can also be applied toward the BACB requirement for concentrated supervised fieldwork. Students can take practicum courses that would also apply toward this requirement.
