Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’ [Graduate Certificate in Accounting and Financial Decision Making](http://www.damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/certificates/accounting?utm_medium=website&utm_source=catalog&utm_campaign=gcafdm) helps students build critical skills for essential financial practices, positioning them for a managerial role. Students learn to see business problems clearly, identify the strategic implications of potential solutions, and develop innovative ways to achieve organizational goals.
In just five courses—with the option to take a sixth to deepen their learning—students will advance their understanding of critical financial practices and build the skills necessary to analyze financial statements, assess risk, and make informed decisions. Depending on the electives they choose, they’ll explore critical topics in greater depth, such as resource acquisition, capital budgeting, and information technology.
Students may enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Accounting and Financial Decision Making for full-time or part-time study.
