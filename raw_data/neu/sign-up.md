Curious about your child’s language development? 
Participate in our PLAUSL project!
The PLAUSL project at Northeastern University, funded by the NIH, is inviting families for a study investigating children’s learning and language development. 
We are seeking first-graders (with or without a formal diagnosis of autism) to participate in our study. The child must be a native speaker of American English, be right-handed, and have typical hearing and vision (or corrected to normal). To see if your child is eligible, fill out our screener.

### Time 2 Learn Study
We are recruiting participants with and without Developmental Language Disorders!
##### In this study, we are interested in how we can improve memory retention by shifting the times of day we learn. This study has two parts:
##### The first part of the study is a 2-hour session to get your language and reading profile, done over Zoom.
##### The second part of the study is a 1-week speech training experiment. You will pick up equipment from our lab and then complete 3-4 short training exercises Monday-Wednesday in the mornings or evenings. You will then come in to the lab for a 2-hour EEG at the end of the week. There is also an option for a 1-week training experiment that can be done completely remotely on your own computer.
**If interested, fill out our self-screener here to determine eligibility and book your first session!**
