Students will apply the knowledge and skills obtained in their didactic and integrative courses to address the ethical, legal, financial, and organizational aspects of their project.

Each student will have a scholarly project advisor and expert mentor working with them. In addition, they have the opportunity to study with faculty from other Northeastern departments and research centers, and with others in Boston’s nursing community whose work addresses clinical and organizational problems.
Students have opportunities to work across disciplines and access populations and sites throughout their project work through Northeastern’s close ties with the Institute on Urban Health Research; the Center for Community Health Education, Research, and Service; and other organizations.
