2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Designed for Massachusetts-based aspiring teachers and career changers, the Master of Arts in Teaching in Elementary Education (MAT)1
The Elementary MAT+ provides qualifying students with the opportunity to complete a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) with further study in a selected area of expertise. Currently, students can take additional coursework to earn either endorsement for an additional license in special education (Teacher of Students of Moderate Disabilities, PreK–8) or endorsement for an additional license in ESL (Teacher of English as a Second Language, Pre-K–6) to the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Teacher candidates may also plan a program of study that allows for triple licensure in consultation with the program director.
A formal application for approval or placement of field-based experiences for prepracticum and practicum requirements must be filed with the Office of Licensure and Field Experience before a student may enroll in a course requiring fieldwork. Deadline for fall placements and approvals must be completed by April 1st (of the previous spring quarter), October 1st for winter placements and approvals, and February 1st for spring placements and approvals.
