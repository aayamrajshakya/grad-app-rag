## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Sociology of Health and Illness](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/socl/)
#### SOCL 3441
Offers a substantial overview of the sociology of health and illness. Medical sociology is an important subfield of sociology with important links to public health, social psychology, psychology, and other medical fields. Emphasizes several critical areas: society and disease; theoretical understandings of health inequalities; medicalization and social control; healthcare professions and professionalization; and the American healthcare system. Offers students an opportunity to obtain analytical frameworks to explore other topics in medical sociology not covered in this course. 


### [Qualitative Methods in Health and Illness ](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/phth/)
#### PHTH 6320
Discusses qualitative inquiry in general and specifically in topics related to public health and experiences of self, health, illness, and the body. Qualitative research aims to achieve in-depth and contextual understanding of people, culture, and societies and usually employs texts, interviews, published materials, images, and focus group discussions as sources of data. The course integrates theoretical and methodological readings and discussions with designing and conducting a qualitative project. Offers students an opportunity to understand meanings of health, illness, and the body in a variety of “local worlds” and reflect on their importance for informing policy, public health, research, and practice. Requires prior completion of one undergraduate- or graduate-level course in research methods.
