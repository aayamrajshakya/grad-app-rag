# Export Controls & Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
[NU-RES Compliance](https://compliance.research.northeastern.edu "Go to NU-RES Compliance.") > Export Controls and Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
Export Controls
Northeastern University engages in research and educational activities that may involve the development or use of products, goods, hardware, software, materials, or technology that may be subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations. The U.S. government increasingly is focused on the compliance of universities with these laws and regulations. Northeastern is committed to complying with all applicable export controls, as established by the applicable federal regulations. It is critical that everyone in the Northeastern community understands the rules and complies with them fully. This web page is intended to be used by faculty, staff, and students as a reference.

Export License Decision Tree
U.S. export controls exist to protect U.S. national security, economic and foreign policy interests. Export controls govern the shipment, transmission, or transfer of certain regulated items, information or software to foreign persons or entities. Export control regulations apply, when shipping or transferring regulated (“controlled”) items, including physical items, such as biological materials, data or software outside of the U.S. Such shipments or transfers may require approval from the U.S. Government in the form of an export license.

Export Controls Triggers in Research & Critical Technologies
There are certain types of research and contractual requirements that can trigger export controls or additional security requirements to safeguarding CUI/CDI.
  * Types of Research​ 
    * Military or Defense Articles and Services​
    * High Performance Computing or Encryption Technology​
    * Dual Use Technologies ​
    * Missiles & Missile Technology​
    * Chemical/Biological Weapons​
    * Nuclear Technology​
    * Select Agents & Toxins ​

  * Funding Source (DOD, DOE, Private Industry)​
  * Publication & Dissemination Restrictions​
  * Research Restricted to US Persons​
  * Extreme IT Security Requirements​
  * Receiving, Storing or Generating CUI (CDI, Nuclear, Intelligence, etc.) 


Critical Technologies
These technologies were previously referred to as Emerging and Foundational Technologies. The “Critical Technologies” name change took place under the Export Control Reform Act, allowing the agency to streamline the review, whereas previously they were trying to decide which were foundational and which were emerging. Government agencies monitor these technologies and as they see fit, they will impose controls on the technologies. The controls placed on these technologies are related U.S. economic interest, and national security reasons, including misuse of these technologies such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or human rights violations. The full list of “Critical and Emerging Technologies” can be found [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Critical-and-Emerging-Technologies-List-2024-Update.pdf). 
The following is a list of Critical Technologies, the topics in bold are current research areas at Northeastern.

International Shipping
All shipments of tangible items to a foreign country (including Canada) are subject to export controls. Sometimes the university must obtain an export license from the Commerce Department or State Department for the shipment. In some instances specific documentation must also be filed with the government before a shipment can be made. As the exporter you bear the responsibility to ensure compliance, failure to do so may constitute an export violation that could result in severe fines and/or other penalties. If you are planning an international shipment or if you have any questions on international shipping, please contact the Export Compliance Office exportcontrol@northeastern.edu.
Information required for review international shipments and determine license requirements
  * What are you shipping?


  * Where is it shipping to?


  * Who is receiving the shipment (end-user)?


  * What is the intended use (end-use)?


  * Is it a temporary export?


  * What is the value of the shipment?


  * Is the shipment linked to sponsored research? If so, who is the sponsor? 


Shipping Process and Future Solutions
Currently at NU, international shipping reviews take place through processes developed with other departments, such as OARS and NU-RES, as well as creating awareness through training for faculty and staff. However, these are just short-term solutions, we are looking at more powerful and consistent ways to protect our faculty and staff by investing in a centralized shipping solution, which would provide visibility for ALL international shipments at NU. The shipping platform we are exploring as a long-term solution is [eShipGlobal](https://www2.eshipglobal.com/), which is a global shipping compliance software used by over 900 academic institutions across the U.S. This shipping platform provides the ability to house all major shipping carriers in one system (FedEx, UPS, DHL), as well as automate compliance checks for both export controls, as well as environmental health and safety. 
Imports & Customs Clearance
Please contact Dolliff & Co., Inc. for assistance with import issues. They hold a Customs Power of Attorney for Northeastern and can help with any of your shipments.

DOD Distribution Statements
DOD Distribution Statements[Distribution statements](https://discover.dtic.mil/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/distribution_statements_and_reasonsSept2018.pdf) are assigned to technical documents by the controlling DoD office that sponsors the work, to assign responsibilities and describe procedures for marking and managing technical documents, and to denote the extent to which they are available for secondary distribution, release, and dissemination without additional approvals or authorization. The presence of a distribution statement B-F requires Northeastern to safeguard the technical documentation related to the project until it is cleared for release. In most cases, distribution statements will appear when other restrictive clauses, mentioned below, are also present. 
EAR99
Products, services and technology that are not specifically controlled for export by the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) are classified as EAR99. They fall under the U.S. Department of Commerce jurisdiction and are no listed on the Commerce Control List (CCL). 
EAR99 items generally consist of low-technology consumer goods and do not require a license in most situations.
ECCN 
Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) is an alpha-numeric code, e.g., 3A001 that is made up of the item category, its product group, and primary reason for control. 
The ECCN entry describes the item and specifies licensing requirements. All ECCNs are listed in the Commerce Control List (CCL)  
(Supplement No. 1 to Part 774 of the EAR) which is available [here](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/regulations/export-administration-regulations-ear). 
The CCL is divided into ten broad categories, and each category is further subdivided into five product groups: 
Commerce Control List Categories  
1 = Special Materials and Related Equipment, Chemicals, “Microorganisms,” and “Toxins”  
2 = Materials Processing  
3 = Electronics  
4 = Computers  
5 = Telecommunications and “Information Security”  
6 = Sensors and Lasers  
7 = Navigation and Avionics  
8 = Marine  
9 = Aerospace and Propulsion
Deemed Export
An export of “controlled” technology or source code is “deemed” to take place when it is released to a foreign person in the U.S.

## Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI)
This website provides a general overview of capabilities to appropriately safeguard controlled unclassified information (CUI) at Northeastern. KRI, LLC at Northeastern University has separate processes related to CUI and computing security procedures. Those working with or at KRI will receive instructions from KRI.
The Office of Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Department of Defense (DOD), is requiring contractors receiving DOD contracts to undergo an assessment to determine their cybersecurity maturity. The assessment will be performed by a 3rd party and will result in a[ Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/). Northeastern is currently working to meet CMMC level 2 certification requirements. New information will be added to this webpage as it becomes available.

    * Receives​
    * Possesses ​
    * Created ​
    * On behalf of the U.S. Government ​
  * There are different categories of CUI. ​The complete list from NARA can be found [here](https://www.archives.gov/cui/registry/category-list).

  * Not all levels of CUI require **[NIST SP 800-171](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf)/CMMC​**
  * [DFARS 252.204.7012 ](https://www.acquisition.gov/dfars/252.204-7012-safeguarding-covered-defense-information-and-cyber-incident-reporting.): this clause is incorporated in DOD contracts, it outlines the requirements of safeguarding CDI (category of CUI) and reporting breaches. ​


What is CUI vs. not CUI
CUI Incident Reporting
A CUI/CDI incident is a real or imminent violation of security, policy, or practice. ​
An incident could cause loss or damage to hardware, software, networks, or data (electronic or hard copy), or could affect personnel. ​
CUI/CDI incidents include but are not limited to: ​
  * Improper storage of CUI/CDI ​
  * Actual or suspected mishandling of CUI/CDI ​
  * When unauthorized individuals gain access to CUI/CDI (physical or electronic) ​
  * Unauthorized release of CUI/CDI (to public facing websites or to unauthorized individuals) ​
  * Suspicious behavior from the workforce (Insider Threats) ​
  * General disregard for security procedures ​
  * Seeking access to information outside the scope of current responsibilities ​
  * Attempting to enter or access sensitive areas (where CUI/CDI is stored, discussed, or processed)


Reporting logistics: 
Report any incidents of CUI/CDI or export control material mishandling to: ​
CMMC_Program_Office@northeastern.edu​
CUI@northeastern.edu​
  * Do not email potential instances of CUI/CDI or export-controlled data when reporting an incident to the above email accounts
  * Only include a notification that a potential incident has occurred​
  * Documents containing CUI/CDI markings should only be shared through GCC high email accounts​


Employees are required to report: 
  * Any actual or suspected mishandling of CUI/CDI or export-controlled items;​
  * Any suspicious behaviors among the workforce that could potentially compromise security; or ​
  * Lead to the misuse of CUI/CDI or export-controlled materials​
  * As soon as possible after discovery​


​When in doubt, report it!
