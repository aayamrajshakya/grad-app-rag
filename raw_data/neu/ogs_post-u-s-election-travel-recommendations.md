> ### September 8, 2025 Update
On September 6, 2025, the U.S. Department of State (DoS) announced that effective immediately, applicants for U.S. nonimmigrant visas, including F-1, F-2, J-1, and J-2 visas, "should schedule their visa interview appointments at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country of nationality or residence"
For more information, please review OGS' post here: [Visa Interview Appointments Should be Scheduled in Country of Residence or Nationality](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/visa-interview-appointments-must-be-scheduled-in-country-of-residence-or-nationality/)
> ### June 20, 2025 Update
The U.S. Department of State has officially resumed scheduling visa interviews for F-1 and J-1 student visa applicants. This means that students and scholars can now book their visa appointment at a local U.S. embassy or consulate. This is great news for all incoming international students preparing to join us for the upcoming academic term, and for all returning students who traveled home this summer and have an expired visa.
In addition, as part of new screening procedures implemented by the Department of State (DOS):
  * Applicants must be prepared for their online presence to be reviewed as part of the visa application process
  * Applicants are required to set their social media profiles to "public"


OGS continues to advise current students to avoid traveling internationally for the sole purposes of renewing their F/J visa.

> ### May 27, 2025 Update
The U.S. Department of State temporarily paused the scheduling of new F-1/J-1 visa appointments while it reviews its procedures related to social media screening as part of the visa application process. 
Due to this visa pause, OGS strongly recommends that students and alumni do not travel for the sole purpose of renewing their F/J visa.

> ### March 26, 2025 Update
Upon taking office on January 20th, the Trump administration signed an [executive order](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fpresidential-actions%2F2025%2F01%2Fprotecting-the-united-states-from-foreign-terrorists-and-othernational-security-and-public-safety-threats%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cj.christ%40northeastern.edu%7C3cb9512af6de40b1cfd108dd6c0b6d1d%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638785518506966109%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=tYGxkpqD3%2BHFBgpZ8mJovb8zUP5Jmf7xB1SPwPm5Duw%3D&reserved=0) signaling its intention to restrict entry to the U.S. from “countries of particular concern.” We are writing to share resources and guidance for members of our global community and to urge those who might be affected to exercise caution when traveling or consider delaying international travel. Additionally, anyone who holds an Advanced Parole re-entry document (rather than a valid visa) and has discretionary protection (rather than legal status) may want to reconsider travel abroad.
While the administration has not announced any travel restrictions or bans, news reports suggest that it is likely to categorize nations in three groups — Red, Orange, and Yellow — with restrictions ranging from barred entry to a more rigorous visa application process. We expect these orders to face legal challenges and will keep you updated if there are additional updates to our travel guidance.
In addition, there have been increased reports of non-U.S. citizens encountering challenges when entering the U.S. Therefore, all travelers without U.S. citizenship should develop a contingency plan in case they have difficulty returning to the U.S. 
> 1. If you are an enrolled student, plan any necessary travel during university vacations/recesses - students are strongly advised against traveling during required academic terms. Maintaining your status by making normal progress in your academic program, complying with attendance/absenteeism policies, and attending your on-ground courses in person is critical. 
> 2. Follow all [international travel guidance provided by OGS](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/international-travel/)
> 3. [Register Your Travel](https://globalsafety.northeastern.edu/travel-registry/) with Northeastern. It is highly recommended that all students, faculty, and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations abroad in “[My Travel Plans,](https://globalsafety.northeastern.edu/travel-registry/)” also called the “Travel Registry.” This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions pose health or safety risks. In addition, it enables on-campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students, faculty, and staff who may need medical or security assistance. 
> 4. Register your travel with your home country’s embassy
> 5. Develop a contingency plan so that there are contacts on both sides of the port of entry who know to contact the appropriate Embassy if they don’t hear from you within a certain amount of time.
> 6. Prepare for the possibility that your electronic devices may be searched.
> 7.

F-1 and J-1 International students and scholars should [reach out to the Office of Global Services](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/contact/) with any questions. Students with other visa sponsorships or status should contact an experienced immigration attorney for additional guidance. We know that there is a great deal of uncertainty at this time, and we encourage you to stay informed and prepared.

OGS has published a new resource and FAQ to help international students and scholars understand what documents they are required to carry while inside the U.S.

> ### February 11, 2025 update
Some international students, faculty, and staff may be considering travel outside the U.S. for academic programs or vacations. What should they keep in mind?
Members of our international and immigrant community based at a U.S. campus should continue to be proactive about travel plans and prepare for the possibility of sudden change.
Any citizens of a country that was subject to a travel ban in the past may want to be particularly cautious about international travel in the coming months. Anyone who holds an Advanced Parole re-entry document (rather than a valid visa) and has discretionary protection (rather than legal status) may want to re-consider travel abroad.
International students, faculty, and staff who are not citizens of a country subject to a past travel ban, and who have a valid U.S. visa, face fewer risks when traveling internationally. Still, all international travelers should expect additional screening by U.S. immigration when you return from abroad.
OGS has also prepared a set of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) to provide basic guidance to F-1/J-1 students and recent alumni about planning for the coming months. 
You can [access the FAQs here](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB000022671).

To the International Community at Northeastern University:
With results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections confirmed, we want to share important information for those in our community who hold re-entry visas, including international students, visiting scholars, faculty, researchers, and staff. We are encouraging members of the Northeastern community to be proactive with international travel plans during the upcoming months. 
**To minimize potential disruption to your studies, work, or research, we strongly recommend returning to the U.S. no later than January 6, 2025, the start of Northeastern’s Winter/Spring academic term**. This will allow you to be present on campus before possible restrictions take effect. 
If you have questions about returning to the university after international travel, please contact: 
  * For international students and scholars, submit an inquiry form at [Contact – Office of Global Services](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.northeastern.edu%2Fogs%2Fcontact%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cj.christ%40northeastern.edu%7Ce1b7d7fc9bcf4d852bc708dd08c1f96c%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638676351391541799%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=wSEd6wnfEjiwuOp4K5nHDjdKmNz865zQl3xHWNImmvM%3D&reserved=0)
