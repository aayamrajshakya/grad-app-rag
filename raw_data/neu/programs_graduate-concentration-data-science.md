## This concentration is ideal for
MBA students who want to use technology to analyze data
Emerging leaders interested in jobs like business intelligence analyst or data analytics manager
Business students looking to build skills in the tools and technologies of data science
## Develop technical skills in data science to inform strategic decisions 
As businesses leverage more smart technologies and devices in their operations, the amount of data we have at our fingertips grows exponentially. In this environment, organizations value professionals who can inform strategic decisions by analyzing that data and developing models that can identify and predict patterns. 
In our forward-looking MBA x Data Science concentration—offered in partnership with [Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/)—you'll learn from Khoury's professors as you develop proficiency in performing data analysis and experience with the key tools and technologies in the field. Your courses will cover data management and processing, machine learning and learning theory, and data mining. Plus, you'll have the chance to work with tools like Python, R, SQL, and Tableau. 
If you have a degree in computer science, you can jump right into the MBA x Data Science coursework. If your degree is in another field, you'll start with 16 credits of bridge courses taught by Khoury faculty to prepare you for the advanced computer science curriculum. 
## Course requirements
