## Estimate the cost of your undergraduate education
We’re excited you’re interested in all of the benefits of a Northeastern University education and are committed to providing you with clear information around our financial aid programs and costs. If you’re a prospective Undergraduate Day first-time student, our interactive calculators will give you an estimate of your financial aid eligibility and net cost you and your family may be expected to pay.
In addition to the many forms of need-based aid available, students may also be considered for competitive [merit-based scholarships](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/undergraduate/types-of-aid/).*
## Net cost calculators
As you use these calculators, it’s important to remember the calculated amount of need-based financial aid is an estimate, not an official offer, and is not intended for all students and situations.
You must still complete your CSS Profile, your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), and submit other supporting documents to find out your actual financial aid offer. [Learn more about the financial aid application process.](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/undergraduate/how-to-apply/)
Please note, these calculators are not intended for international, transfer, returning, graduate, or College of Professional Studies students.

## MyinTuition Quick College Cost Estimator
This calculator uses six basic financial questions to provide you with a need-based financial aid estimate and to help you to anticipate your college costs. We recommend that you use the MyinTuition Quick College Cost Estimator to best determine overall aid eligibility and estimate for the type of financial assistance you may be eligible to receive at Northeastern University.

## Net Price Calculator
This calculator employs more in-depth financial information to provide an estimate of your need-based financial aid award and family contribution. Completion of the Net Price Calculator may require additional time and you are encouraged to have your financial documents, including most recent Income Tax Returns, earnings statements (W-2 forms), as well as asset and savings information, readily available.
Please note, the Net Price Calculator may not adequately capture all information related to a family’s financial profile. As a result, limitations may exist with regard to complex family financial circumstances, especially for parents who are divorced or separated, self-employed, or business owners.
Use the [Net Price Calculator >](https://npc.collegeboard.org/student/app/northeastern)
*While your results may include an estimate of “need-based scholarship,” please note this is an estimate of all institutional funding available at Northeastern University. Any merit-based award from Northeastern would be included in this total, and not in addition to the estimate.
