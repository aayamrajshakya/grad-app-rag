Accreditations 
The Doctor of Nursing Practice at Northeastern University is accredited by the [Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education](https://www.aacnnursing.org/ccne-accreditation).
Program features 
  * Students complete a scholarly DNP project
  * A minimum of 500 practicum hours during the course of the program
  * Opportunities for interdisciplanary study and research
  * This program is appropriate for licensed nurses who possess a master’s degree in nursing. In some cases registered nurses holding a master’s degree in a related health field may be acceptable


Scholarly project 
The DNP program culminates in the successful completion of a DNP scholarly project that demonstrates mastery of expert practice knowledge and is completed over three semesters (nine semester hours). The scholarly project must be a significant, evidence-based contribution to existing nursing knowledge and be suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal or a book. This DNP scholarly project could be a program needs assessment with program development and evaluation, evaluation of an existing program, development of an assessment instrument/protocol, a cost/benefit analysis of program models, or another scholarly project as approved by the student’s advisor.
Students will apply knowledge and skills obtained in the didactic and integrative courses in order to address the ethical, legal, financial, and organizational aspects of the scholarly project. The DNP student will discuss his/her topic of interest, the development of the project and how it addresses the needs of a selected population; and evaluate the implementation and outcomes of the project. Each student will have a scholarly project advisor and expert mentor working with them on the project. In addition, you will have the opportunity to study with faculty from other Northeastern departments and research centers and with others in Boston’s nursing community whose work addresses clinical and organizational problems.
Our close ties with the university’s Institute on Urban Health Research; School of Social Science and Urban Affairs and Public Policy; the Center for Community Health Education, Research, and Service; and other organizations provide opportunities to work across disciplines and access populations and sites for the DNP scholarly project.
