Statement of purpose 
##  Statement of purpose 
The statement of purpose is important for determining an applicant’s motivation and conviction in applying for their desired program. We are looking for specific and driven statements of purpose. The statement is a good place for applicants to contextualize their educational experience. We recommend a length of 1000 words; however, this is a guideline and not a hard limit.
Letters of recommendation 
##  Letters of recommendation 
For students who are applying directly from their undergraduate program, we recommend two academic references and one professional reference. For students who are applying from the workforce, we recommend two professional references and one academic reference. These are guidelines and not requirements. Recommenders must submit letters via the link provided by the application portal — we can’t accept letters via third-party systems such as Interfolio.
