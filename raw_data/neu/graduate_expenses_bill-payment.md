## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University is committed to assisting students in developing a plan for financing their Northeastern education. Through a variety of options—including federal financial aid, Northeastern’s monthly payment plan, supplemental loans, and your own resources—a plan can be designed that will make your education costs affordable. 
## Student Financial Responsibility Agreement 
As compelled by federal law, all students who enroll in classes at Northeastern are required to complete and accept the [Student Financial Responsibility Agreement](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/sfra/), which acknowledges their obligations and understanding of the financial policies of the university. This will be available for completion after July 1 each academic year. The SFRA informs students of the financial responsibilities associated with enrolling for classes and explains the potential consequences that may result if a student fails to meet those obligations. This agreement must be completed once per academic year and is located on the Student Hub. Failure to complete the SFRA will result in a hold that prevents registration.
## Payment Options
Northeastern accepts multiple payment methods. Payments will be accepted for billed charges only. Northeastern is not able to process payments for more than the balance due on the student’s account. 
Accepted methods of payment include:
  * Electronic check and credit card


  * [International payments via payment partners](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/payment-partners/)


  * 529 payments


  * Other payment options including external scholarships, tuition paid by employers or other third parties, tuition reimbursement, and tuition insurance 


For additional information regarding payment options, visit the [Student Financial Services website](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/).
For information on payment timelines, late payments, and adjustments to tuition, please see the graduate Billing and Tuition Adjustments page.
## Financing Options
###  Northeastern’s Monthly Payment Plan
Northeastern offers a [monthly payment plan](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/financing-options/), which allows students and families to divide their educational costs each semester into smaller, more manageable installments. In using this plan, it can reduce your need to borrow, thereby reducing the overall cost of education. The monthly payment plan can be combined with awarded financial aid as well as other payment and financing options. Multiple people can set up payment plans for the same student. 
### Student Loans
There are a number of [educational loan programs](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/financing-options/) available to assist eligible students and families in covering expenses over and above any financial aid that may be awarded from Student Financial Services. Most private lenders have credit and income requirements that students and/or parents must meet before being approved for these programs. When researching the loan and lender that best meet your needs, make sure you take into consideration the interest rate; the quality of customer service; as well as any origination, disbursement, and/or repayment fees.
## Account Credit Balance Refunds
The university automatically issues refunds for eligible students whose account reflects a credit balance.
If a credit card has been used to pay any portion of the amount due, the refund will be made first to that credit card. If the credit balance on the account exceeds the amount that was paid via credit card, these additional funds will be refunded by check or direct deposit.
