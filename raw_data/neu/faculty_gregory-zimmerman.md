Professor Zimmerman has authored over 60 scholarly articles. With colleagues and graduate students, he has published peer reviewed articles in top criminology and criminal justice journals such as Criminology, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, and Justice Quarterly. The interdisciplinary nature of Professor Zimmerman’s work has also led to publications in sociology, public health, medical, and psychology journals, including American Sociological Review, American Journal of Public Health, JAMA, Social Science and Medicine, Journal of Marriage and Family, Social Forces, Social Problems, and Journal of Youth and Adolescence. He has also published numerous book chapters and has been invited to speak at national conferences. He is currently serving as an Editorial Board member for several journals in the social sciences. Professor Zimmerman has served as co-principal investigator on projects funded externally by a variety of grant-making institutions including Arnold Ventures, the City of Boston and the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston, the U.S. Department of Justice, and the City of Oakland, California. His role on these projects has focused primarily on the spatial distribution of violent crime, law enforcement responses to violence, and the development of new tools to fight the opioid epidemic.
