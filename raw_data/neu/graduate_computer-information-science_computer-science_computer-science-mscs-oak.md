2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University’s Master of Science in Computer Science is designed to prepare students for a variety of careers in computer science. The program combines both computing and important application domains—enabling you to increase your broad-based knowledge in the field while allowing you to delve deeper in specific areas through elective courses.
## MS Thesis Committee 
The MS thesis committee must satisfy the following conditions:
1. A total of three members, including the advisor.
2. Two members from Khoury College of Computer Sciences (or affiliated to Khoury).
3. At least one member who is at “arm’s length” from the particular work in the thesis. This means that there should be at least one member who isn’t a co-advisor on the thesis.
4. External members are allowed but not required.
More members (internal or external) can be added as readers to the committee, so long as the above minimum requirements are fulfilled. 
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
Students should refer to the course numbering table for [graduate course leveling](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/records-transcripts/).
