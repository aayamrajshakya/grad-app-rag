Northeastern’s Graduate Certificate in Human-Centered Informatics focuses on the design, development, and evaluation of IT systems with a particular emphasis on the relations and interactions between people and IT systems.
The curriculum for this graduate certificate begins with an emphasis on understanding the experience of the user when they interact with technology through designed interfaces. This unique academic approach makes this graduate certificate different from a software engineering program or a visual and artistic design program.
Throughout the targeted coursework, you will have an opportunity to develop the technical skills to study user experience in various IT environments - home, business, social media, healthcare - while focusing on user needs, information architecture, and design of user interfaces.
Those who graduate with the HCI certificate will be able to propose innovative or improved design solutions to real-world problems across the many industries informatics has applications in – these include healthcare, consulting, education, finance, manufacturing, and communications.
