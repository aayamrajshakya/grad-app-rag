Over 15 [graduate certificates](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=Graduate%20Certificate) are available to provide students the opportunity to develop a specialization in an area of their choice. Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. Northeastern is an R1 research institution, rated among universities with the highest research activity.
The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 3,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepare students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
