2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
For program contact information, please visit [the College of Engineering website](https://che.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/ms-chme/). 
The Master of Science in Chemical Engineering is normally pursued by students with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering or closely allied fields. Students wishing to pursue the master’s degree but with undergraduate educational backgrounds other than chemical engineering may be required to complete supplementary undergraduate coursework. These courses are in addition to the minimum course requirements. Students enrolled in the program are encouraged to seek guidance from their instructors and advisor regarding additional coursework that may supplement the graduate curriculum.
Students originally admitted to the master’s degree program who wish to switch to the PhD program must petition the associate chair for graduate studies. If admission is granted, then the student must satisfy all the requirements of the doctoral degree program, including the requirements for doctoral candidacy. 
## Course Requirements
A minimum of 32 semester hours of academic work is required to qualify for the Master of Science degree in chemical engineering.
If pursuing the General Principles and Applications concentration, Professional Development and Communication Essentials (CHME 6390)Seminar (CHME 7390)
If pursuing the Biosystems or Sustainability concentrations, Professional Development and Communication Essentials (CHME 6390)
## Thesis Requirements
Students pursuing a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering with concentration in General Principles and Applications thesis option must submit to the Graduate School of Engineering a written thesis that is approved by the thesis committee and department chair. For details, see the [graduate school requirements and electronic submittal instructions](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-student-services/dissertation-thesis-instructions/). MS with thesis students must also complete an oral master’s thesis defense in order to successfully complete the program. The student will be expected to form a master’s thesis committee, composed of a minimum of three members—one who is the research advisor, one other faculty member from the chemical engineering department, and one member from outside the department. The oral presentation will be open to the public, including students, faculty, and the candidate’s committee.
## Part-time Students
Part-time students may progress according to their plans and time constraints but within the seven-year time limit. A minimum of 32 semester hours of academic coursework is required for part-time students. 
Master of Science students wishing to change their status from part-time to full-time must notify the chemical engineering department and make a formal petition to the Graduate School of Engineering. Refer to the regulations of the Graduate School of Engineering for further information on academic administrative policies.
## Departure Prior to Thesis Completion
Occasionally, students must leave the chemical engineering department prior to completion of all degree requirements. In such instances, long time intervals have often elapsed before thesis or manuscript submission. Accordingly, the department has adopted the guideline that a student cannot submit a thesis for credit beyond three years after the student stops actively pursuing the research. Exceptions may be granted upon petition to the departmental graduate committee. Petitions must demonstrate extenuating circumstances and prove that the research is still of value to the profession.
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/). 
### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Master's Degree inChemical Engineering with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors, in addition to the semester hours required for the chemical engineering concentration selected. For students who concurrently enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, 8 semester hours of the leadership challenge project coursework may be applied to this program’s elective requirements with approval of the program director.
### Engineering Business
Master's Degree in Chemical Engineering with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Business
Students may complete a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Business. Students must apply and be admitted to the Galante Engineering Business Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires the applicant to have earned or be in a program to earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Northeastern University. Students may use some of their breadth electives credits toward both the MS degree and the certificate. The certificate coursework, along with participation in cocurricular professional development elements, earn the Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Business.](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/mechanical-industrial/engineering-business-graduate-certificate/)
All students must complete the following core requirements unless otherwise indicated. Courses cannot double count in two different categories.
