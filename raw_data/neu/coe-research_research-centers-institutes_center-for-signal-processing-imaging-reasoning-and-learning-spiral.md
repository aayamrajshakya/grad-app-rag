#  Center for Signal Processing, Imaging, Reasoning, and Learning (SPIRAL) 
[SPIRAL](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) conducts fundamental and interdisciplinary applied research in the areas of computational modeling, computer vision, distributed computing, image analysis, machine learning, optimization, and signal processing, with application areas spanning affective computing, biomedical imaging, modeling, and simulation, cyber-human systems including brain interfaces and human robot collaboration, geolocalization and positioning systems, neuroscience, wireless communications and networks. SPIRAL is a federation of collaborating research laboratories that jointly strive to conduct rigorous application-driven computational modeling and inference research in diverse contexts, and are committed to providing an inclusive research, academic, and personal development environment for a diverse group of talented individuals at undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral training stages.
