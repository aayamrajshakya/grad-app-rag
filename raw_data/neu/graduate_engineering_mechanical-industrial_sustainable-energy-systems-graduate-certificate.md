## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Sustainable Energy Systems focuses on the integration of energy systems engineering technology with sustainable building systems, including the design and operation of buildings with minimal energy and environmental impact.
This four-course graduate certificate seeks to provide students with opportunities to apply the fundamentals of engineering knowledge and skills to analyze energy systems as they relate to sustainable engineering building design with a focus on renewable energy with LEED certification or with a focus on industrial ecology, including life-cycle analysis and technical cost modeling.
