2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Bioinformatics seeks to provide students with core knowledge in bioinformatics programming, integrating knowledge from the biological, computational, and mathematical disciplines. Students have an opportunity to gain the data and genomic analysis skills needed to employ bioinformatics techniques to biological problems. The graduate certificate consists of four courses, three bioinformatics courses and one elective, totaling 15–16 semester hours.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
