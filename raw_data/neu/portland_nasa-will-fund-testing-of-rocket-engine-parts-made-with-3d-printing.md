Can rocket engine parts be made more effectively using 3D printing? 
A $50,000 grant from the Maine Space Grant Consortium will help Brunswick rocket-maker bluShift find out if the process is better when compared with standard industry processes.
The funds are part of a consortium program called NASA EPSCoR RID. EPSCoR stands for Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. RID stands for Research Infrastructure Development. The Roux Institute at Northeastern University and the University of Maine’s Advanced Manufacturing Center are also part of the project.
Also known as hybrid additive manufacturing, 3D printing will be researched to see if it will allow bluShift to make parts quickly and accurately, and with fewer resources than the usual industry approach.
