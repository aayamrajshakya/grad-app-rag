#  MatthewHitchcock
Assistant Teaching Professor, Writing Program 
Matthew’s research has focused heavily on family archives and research through lived experiences. His dissertation, Commemorative Objects: Tracing Memory, Meaning Making, and Uptakes through Family Photographs, dove into his own family archives, and traced the many uptakes we encounter when looking back while looking forward.
Matthew’s teaching utilizes his experiences with using family archives and often asks students to make their own as fodder for exploration in class. He also uses his background in rhetorical genre studies to help students trace why they write in particular situations and what genres prompt the best actions based on the situation.
Matthew received his Ph.D in English focusing on Writing and Rhetoric in 2021.
