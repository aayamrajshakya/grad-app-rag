##  Align bridge course waivers 
If you’re entering the Align program with some computer science experience through a course taken prior to joining Align or through professional training, you may apply for a course waiver. MS Computer Science Align, MS Data Science Align, and MS Cybersecurity Align students will be considered for a maximum of two course waivers, specifically only for CS 5001 and/or CS 5002. Waivers for CS 5004, CS 5008, DS 5010, DS 5020, CY 5001 or CY 5003 are not allowed.
Students opt into the waiver process and submit supporting materials through the admissions application. Supporting materials required for the waiver include official transcripts, course syllabus of the course(s) taken, and/or description of applicable work experience and must have been submitted with the student’s admissions application or they will not be considered. Supporting material submitted through another modality will not be considered. This course waiver process is only open to enrolled incoming students.
[Please review the CS 5001 and CS 5002 course descriptions in the catalog.](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/#coursestext) Supporting materials included in your application for waiver consideration must demonstrate comparable prior experience. (Note: Not all online courses through sites such as Coursera or EdX will qualify for a waiver.)
