Program overview 
##  Psychology for future minds

The three-year program (MS and CAGS) develops highly competent school psychologists. Some students choose to specialize in early intervention or applied behavior analysis.
Early intervention training prepares school psychologists to work with infants and toddlers and their families in community and related agencies, on interdisciplinary teams, and on the transition to school.
Applied behavior analysis training option is designed to prepare school psychologists to address the learning and behavioral needs of children and adolescents with challenging behaviors in school, home, and community settings, including children with autism spectrum disorders.

Learning model 
Interdisciplinary collaboration 
Our training approach incorporates the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Our students learn how to work on teams in delivering services, and how to draw upon the rich resources of professionals from related disciplines.
Practice-oriented 
A cornerstone of Northeastern University and our program is practice-oriented education. We train students to become highly skilled scientific practitioners and lifelong learners, who employ the scientific, problem-solving method to evaluate their own practice. Real-world projects and work experiences are integrated into coursework and fieldwork. Students complete practicum and internship fieldwork requirements in local area schools. The faculty have developed a rich network of collaborative school psychologists who serve as excellent field supervisors. Faculty assist with placing students at school fieldwork sites in and around the Boston Metropolitan area. During the third year internship, students document their mastery of the training goals through comprehensive case studies.
A supportive learning environment
Northeastern University is known as a student-centered institution, and this student-centered philosophy is prominent in our school psychology program. We view ongoing support and feedback as critical for students’ learning and professional development. We strive to be accessible to students. Faculty members take pride in mentoring and advising students. In addition, students are actively involved in a peer-mentoring program, whereby advanced students provide guidance to first-year students. Students collaborate with faculty on research projects, journal articles, book chapters, and state and national presentations.
Professional identity and social conscience
Our students have a strong professional identity and social conscience. The department has a very active student chapter of the school psychology division of the American Psychological Association (Student Affiliates in School Psychology-SASP). This student chapter plans educational workshops, conferences, and social activities. Many of our alumni have assumed leadership roles in state and national organizations. In addition, they consider themselves advocates for the needs of children.
