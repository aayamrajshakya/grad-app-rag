# Prospective Graduate Student FAQ
If you still have questions after reviewing this FAQ and the [FAQ from the college](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/cssh-graduate-office-admissions-faqs/), please contact the department. 
### Application Questions
What are the application deadlines and required materials?
You can find the applications deadlines and required materials for all graduate programs on the [CSSH website](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/), including our [master’s](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/#masters) and [PhD](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/#phd) programs.
Do I need a faculty sponsor in order to apply to the PhD program?
No, a faculty sponsor is not required. PhD students will be assigned an advisor.
How long should the personal statement and writing sample be and what should it contain?
For PhD students: Your personal statement should be 2 to 3 pages. One of the most important criteria for admission is your potential to successfully conduct research. Please describe your prior experience in research in undergraduate or graduate programs or outside of academia. If you have not had research experience, please describe how your other experiences contribute to your ability to work independently, organize and manage projects, and creatively solve problems.
For all other students: The personal statement should be 2-3 pages. It should reflect on the applicant’s research, curricular interests and professional goals.
The writing sample (PhD and MA only) should be no more than 30 pages. Ideally, it should be a seminar paper or thesis related to political science. However, if you do not have a political science paper, we are happy to consider writing samples from related social science fields. The writing sample should not be co-authored. A published article is also acceptable.
Is the GRE required for admission? If so, is there is a minimum score requirement?
The GRE is optional for the following applicants:
  * All students applying to our masters programs regardless of start term
  * All students applying to our PhD in Political Science program with a Fall 2022 start term


For those submitting GRE scores, we do not have a minimum score requirement, and we evaluate all parts of the application in the context of the whole. Test scores may be helpful for applicants with little or no experience beyond the undergraduate degree.
How will I know if all my materials have been received?
The application system allows you to check the status of your application at any time. More information can be found on the Graduate School’s [Admissions FAQ page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/cssh-graduate-office-admissions-faqs/).
How can I indicate interest in both the Ph.D. and M.A. programs when I apply?
The online application provides an opportunity to indicate interest in both programs. You may also include this in your personal statement.
Can I waive my application fee?
Students who attend any Political Science graduate recruitment event are eligible for an application fee waiver. Events include the University-wide Open House, the CSSH Welcome Day, and department-specific program overviews. When you submit your application, please check “yes” in response to the question, “Did you attend an admission event?” Please enter the date of the event and your application fee will automatically be waived. Please note we cannot provide refunds for fees already paid.
### Other questions

Students wishing to complete the Resilience Studies degrees fully online should meet with the graduate program administrator to discuss a plan of study.
How large is a typical PhD cohort?
A typical PhD cohort is 5-7 students.
Does the department offer summer courses?
The Political Science department does not offer summer courses. Because the Resilience Studies degree program is interdisciplinary, there may be courses offered in other departments that fulfill degree requirements.
