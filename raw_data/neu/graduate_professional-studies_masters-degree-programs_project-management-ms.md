2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Companies succeed or fail based on their ability to bring quality products and services to market in a timely manner. Without skilled project managers in place, companies are challenged to deliver projects on time, on budget, and according to specifications. From inception to completion, project managers are responsible for every step in the process: project definition, cost and risk estimation, schedule planning and monitoring, budget management, negotiation and conflict resolution, project leadership, and project presentation and evaluation.
The Master of Science in Project Management is designed to provide you with the practical skills and theoretical concepts you need to lead complex projects. Featuring real-world case studies, this project management degree presents techniques and tools for managing long- and short-term projects successfully and cost-effectively. Augmenting the core project management courses are concentrations that seek to provide you with content-specific expertise that enables you to deepen your knowledge in your field of interest.
In October of 2021, the Master of Science in Project Management accreditation was re-affirmed for the maximum five-year accreditation cycle (originally accredited in 2009) by the [Project Management Institute Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC)](https://www.pmi.org/), the world's leading association for project management professionals. Accreditation is achieved by meeting the GAC’s rigorous standards, which include an assessment of program objectives and outcomes, a review of onsite and online resources, evaluations of faculty and students, and proof of continuous improvements in the area of project management.
