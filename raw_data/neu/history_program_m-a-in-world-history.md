#  Master of ArtsHistory
The Master of Arts in History offers two concentrations: public history and world history.
Public history encompasses the practice of history outside the academy in museums, state and local historical societies, archives, the National Park Service, and more. Public history includes the study of such topics as material culture, historical exhibits and museums, historical agencies, archival administration, and how difficult issues including slavery and site of violence are presented to the public.
World history focuses on the history of regions or peoples in Africa, Europe, Latin America, Asia, or the United States, with attention to the intersections and connections between national, regional, and global developments.
The master’s program offers an optional cooperative education experience (“co-op”) to eligible students. Cooperative education is central to both the Northeastern experience and to the College of Social Sciences and Humanities experiential liberal arts framework. Northeastern’s signature co-op ecosystem provides qualified master’s students with six-month work experiences as practicing public historians. Graduate students take their work from campus learning spaces, apply their knowledge outside of the classroom, and then bring knowledge and skills gained in community learning spaces back to our campus learning spaces during the cocurricular experiential integration course.
