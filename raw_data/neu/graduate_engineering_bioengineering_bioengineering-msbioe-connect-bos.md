2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Bioengineering—Connect program, with a concentration in biomedical devices and bioimaging, addresses the demand for skilled individuals who can engage with bioengineering challenges and innovations by preparing students from nonengineering backgrounds to become bioengineers. Recognizing bioengineering's complexity and interdisciplinary nature, this Connect program focuses on learners developing the necessary foundational and applied knowledge in mathematics and programming to successfully transition to the bioengineering field. Through specially created and defined core courses, students gain the bioengineering knowledge to excel in their academic coursework and the bioengineering sector.
