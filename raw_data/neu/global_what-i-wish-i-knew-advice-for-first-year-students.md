**Get out of your comfort zone**
Getting out of your comfort zone involves learning new things, meeting new people, seeing new places, and trying new experiences. It can help you achieve goals, boost your self-confidence, and build resilience. A PhD is all about getting out of your comfort zone, in order for you to acquire new knowledge. 
“Your PhD is meant to push you out of your comfort zone and teach you new aspects of critical thinking.” – Dr. Lauren Gauthier, PhD graduate in Pharmaceutical Sciences ‘23
“Be open to new experiences and build connections early.” – Sina Shid-Moosavi, PhD candidate in Civil and Environmental Engineering
“Boston is a city of opportunity. What you need, you will find – but you’ll have to dig a bit for it.” – Nunzio Lore, PhD candidate in Network Science
“Don’t hesitate to reach out, ask questions, and network with people from all walks of life.” – Maria Khalid, PhD candidate in Biology
“Take the numerous opportunities to engage with practitioners and make sure that your research goes beyond academia, and so you make a real impact.” – Shalini Matharage, PhD candidate in Political Science
Check out the University’s Graduate Student Organizations to find clubs, research centers, and other groups to get involved with. 
**Remember to take breaks**
Taking regular breaks is absolutely necessary for healthy brains and well-being. A short break restore will help improve attention, significantly boost performance, and protect you from burnout. Go for a walk if you are feeling drained of energy, take a quick power nap to re-energize when you are tired, meditate to calm stressed nerves, or call a friend to shift focus away from the current task. One popular method of working is called the Pomodoro Technique, where you work for 25 minutes and then take a 5-minute break. Experiment with different break styles and activities to find what works best for you! 
“All PhDs require strong time management, so I recommend taking occasional breaks.” – Christina Sharkey, PhD candidate in Pharmaceutical Sciences
**Explore and learn to live in Boston**
“When you need a break from all that intellectual stimulation, take the time to explore the city. Boston is basically the Olympics of intellects, and being part of that energy is nothing short of inspiring! Boston is like a classroom with better coffee and way cooler museums! Embrace the diversity and resources Boston has to offer. Seriously, this city is like a giant academic buffet, and you should definitely try everything. Be sure to take a stroll around Northeastern and the other universities in town.
Don’t forget to check out the beaches, museums, and parks, too. They’re the perfect spots to relax and recharge. Prepare for the weather. Boston’s four seasons are like a reality show—one minute you’re in summer, the next, you’re knee-deep in snow. So, pack an umbrella, sunscreen, and a winter coat, because you might need them all… at once! Get to know the city’s transportation, you’ll get your steps in for sure, but hey, Boston’s a walkable city, so enjoy the journey!” – Maria Khalid, PhD candidate in Biology
“Boston is a fantastic city for research and networking, but it can be overwhelming at first. Find a good support system, explore the city’s academic and professional resources, and don’t hesitate to reach out to faculty and peers. Also, prepare for the weather—layers are your best friend!” – Mina Fallah, PhD candidate in Personal Health Informatics
**Support each other and find a place to belong:**
“It’s easy to get lonely as PhD students, so cultivate your network, not because of ‘the grind,’ but because it will be your lifeline.” – Nunzio Lore, PhD candidate in Network Science
“Your social network is a very important safety net during a PhD program. Form valuable connections with your friends.” – Micheala Cavalieri, PhD student in Chemical Engineering
“The PhD journey can be isolating but reaching out for help and surrounding yourself with the right professors makes all the difference.” – Shalini Matharage, PhD candidate in Political Science
“Find support to feel like you belong in the Northeastern community.” – Dr. Callie Hansson, PhD graduate in Criminology and Justice Policy ‘25
**Engage in Experiential Learning Opportunities**
“I would advise them [PhD Students] to join if they want to learn and practice important skills like communication, leadership, and problem-solving. The program offers a chance to develop these skills in a supportive environment, which are valuable for both academic and professional growth. It’s a great way to strengthen areas that will help you succeed in your future career.” – Mina Fallah, PhD candidate in Personal Health Informatics
“Just do it. Take the first class, just sign up.” – Shalom Fadullon, PhD student in Chemical Engineering
“It’s a great way to develop leadership, communication, and networking skills that can complement your academic work and open doors for future career opportunities. The program offers a unique blend of experiential learning and professional development that can enhance your research and broaden your career prospects. Additionally, the program fosters a supportive community where you can connect with peers and professionals, share experiences, and grow together. So, if you’re ready to step out of your comfort zone, challenge yourself, and gain valuable skills that will benefit you both during and after your PhD journey, the LEADERs program is a great choice.” – Maria Khalid, PhD candidate in Biology
**Trust the process**
“Now in my fourth year, I’ve reached a point where I’m truly satisfied with my PhD experience. It takes time, but eventually, you come full circle.” – Shalini Matharage, PhD candidate in Political Science
“Trust in the process, have patience with the journey, and practice unwavering focus on the ultimate goal of helping others to succeed, which in turn will make you successful.” – Stephen Adepoju, PhD candidate in Chemical Engineering
