#  VijetaSaini
Part-Time Lecturer in English 
Vijeta Saini is a recent PhD from the English Department at Northeastern University, where she was a CSSH Scholar and the recipient of both the CSSH Experiential Fellowship at MIT and the FLEX Fellowship. Her research offers the first sustained scholarly analysis of Shakespeare’s presence in Punjab across theatre and film, arguing that engagements since the early 20th century shaped modern Punjabi theatre and later influenced regional cinema. Her essay, “Disappearances and The Durbar,” was recently published by Oxford University Press in Shakespeare’s Afterlife in the Royal Collection (2025). She has presented her work at the Shakespeare Association of America, King’s College London, Harvard, Tufts, Johns Hopkins University, MIT, and other institutions in the U.S., and at Punjabi University (Patiala), Khalsa College (Amritsar), and S.D. College (Hoshiarpur) in India.
