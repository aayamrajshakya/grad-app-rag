Program overview 
##  Advanced training in psychology 
Northeastern’s Master of Science in Applied Psychology program is designed to provide evidence-based knowledge and counseling skills to students who seek entry into doctoral programs in psychology and graduates in human services, psychology, and health sciences who want advanced training in applied psychology—but do not seek to become licensed mental health counselors.
In one year of full-time online study, the program provides a strong foundation in scientific research and clinical/counseling psychology practice while offering the flexibility to pursue coursework in child, adolescent, and family psychology or prevention science.
You’ll gain core competencies and a deep understanding of the development and application of well-tested practices and strategies for promoting mental health and well-being for all individuals, including youth and families.

Accreditations 
This program does not meet licensing regulations for mental health counselors in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and does not replace the existing 60-credit Master of Science in Counseling Psychology (MSCP) required by the Massachusetts Board of Allied Mental Health for counseling licensure. It also does not lead to licensure eligibility as a mental health counselor.
Program details 
  * The program is ideal for students who want a deeper understanding of applied psychology disciplines to clarify their interests in preparation for advanced graduate training or employment.
  * The 100% online curriculum provides you with the flexibility to continue working or earn your degree from wherever you are.
  * You can also complete the 30-credit program flexibly with a part-time option.


Career preparation and outlook 
Graduates of the Master of Science in Applied Psychology work in various for-profit and nonprofit organizations focused on community mental health, higher education, research, healthcare, and more. The need for trained professionals is growing as most people with a diagnosable mental health disorder do not receive treatment from individuals with advanced training in applied psychology.
The MSAP program prepares students for careers in a variety of settings, such as:
  * Community prevention programs
  * Health departments
  * Nonprofit human service agencies
  * Social advocacy centers


Or, you can choose to continue your graduate education with doctoral training in:
  * Psychology (all subdisciplines)
  * Prevention science
  * School psychology
  * Public health
