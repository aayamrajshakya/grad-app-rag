## THE CENTER FOR RESEARCH INNOVATION
# COMMERCIALIZATION SPECIALISTS
Commercialization Specialists function as a bridge between Northeastern researchers and industry R&D teams.
## MEET OUR SPECIALISTS
As Commercialization Specialists, they execute a suite of fundamental responsibilities within the field of technology transfer and play a critical role in bringing Northeastern technologies to life in the world’s living rooms, office spaces, and natural habitats.
The CRI partnered with the College of Science to kick off the Commercialization Specialist program. College of Science collaborator, Jared Auclair, Associate Dean of Professional Programs and Graduate Affairs, finds great benefit in the program as it “provides PhD candidates an opportunity to learn about intellectual property and how they can apply their technical training to a non-traditional career path.”
### JANE LEE
Jane is a PhD Candidate in Bioengineering, blending academic research with practical experience in entrepreneurship and management. She is actively engaged in cutting-edge research at Northeastern University, developing a novel wearable optical device in the Niedre Lab to investigate the dynamics of circulating tumor cells and gain insights into cancer metastasis.

### Wes Roberts

Wes is a PhD student in theoretical physics, with a focus on quantum materials and quantum information. He received his BS in Physics and Philosophy from the University of Pittsburgh in 2017, after which he completed a Master of Studies degree in Philosophy of Physics at Oxford University.
Wes’s research broadly rests in the study of open quantum systems – systems that are exposed to some form of environmental disturbance. This area is uniquely placed at the intersection of what is theoretically interesting and practically important. On the one hand, the study of open systems is vital to resolving longstanding problems in the foundations of quantum theory. On the other, all quantum systems that serve as the basis for emerging technologies are subject to some degree of environmental interference, which must be well-understood if these technologies are to become practicable.
