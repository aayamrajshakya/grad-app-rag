# Game Experience Design, Graduate Certificate
Focusing on innovation, societal impact and player-centric design, students in the Graduate Certificate in Game Experience Design get hands-on experience in designing games under the guidance of world leading faculty and industry experts in game design.
[Request More Information](https://camd.northeastern.edu/graduate-programs/request/)
The Graduate Certificate in Game Experience Design offers students an opportunity to obtain the skills for designing successful game products. The game industry has expanded to include social and mobile gaming, augmented and virtual reality, as well as games for health, education, and science. Beyond the game industry, there has been an increased interest to “gamify” experiences and introduce playfulness into products and environments. All this has resulted in an increased need for people with game design skills – people who can re-envision how we learn, work, and play. Northeastern’s unique Graduate Certificate in Game Experience Design is a one-year, 17-semester-hour program developed to meet this need. Embedded in the CAMD graduate course offerings, students in the certificate program will have the opportunity to join CAMD graduate students from diverse disciplines for a range of events, exhibitions, guest lectures, and workshops.
Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this certificate, students should be able to apply game design methods, tools, and techniques to create new and innovative experiences.
