##  ABOUT THE PROGRAM 
The mission of the Office of Global Services’ Global Student Mentor Program is to:
  1. Support incoming international graduate students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and American culture
  2. Foster engagement with the Northeastern community
  3. Improve resource awareness and utilization


A peer mentor is a current international student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life. The students who receive mentorship are called “mentees.”
Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor. The mentor will reach out first via Qooper to introduce themselves and set up the first meeting. Throughout the academic term, mentees will connect with their mentor in person through 1-1 meetings, small group sessions, and group gatherings. Small group meetings take place in-person at least once per month. Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student. Mentors will help their mentees set goals and make steps toward completing these goals throughout the first semester at Northeastern. Mentees might consider discussing the following with their mentors:
  * How to access resources on campus
  * How to join a club or get involved with the campus community
  * Suggestions for developing college-level study skills
  * How to use public transportation in Boston
  * Questions about American culture
  * Feelings of homesickness


Within the GSM Program, students will have the opportunity to build community in various forms:
  1. Small Group Sessions
  2. At least 2 GSM Meetups (events) per semester
  3. Affinity Groups


Small Group sessions are led by a Global Student Mentor and are designed to introduce parts of the curriculum while providing a more intentional space for community development.
GSM Meetups are a great opportunity to meet people from all over the world with a shared experience- a first semester graduate student at Northeastern.
Affinity groups are identity based groups designed to connect students to campus resources for long term support and resources. The GSM Program only supports students in their first semester, so this is a great way to get connected to the broader campus community. Currently, the Affinity Groups include:
  * First Generation
  * Women


It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor. This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester.
Northeastern has many different mentorship programs, so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs. The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program. If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program, please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available.
