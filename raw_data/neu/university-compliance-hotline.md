The University strongly encourages all faculty, administrators, staff, and students to report suspected or actual wrongful conduct through channels that the University establishes for such reporting. While the university expects you to bring forward any concerns to your direct supervisor, faculty member, chair, or other, the Anonymous & Confidential Reporting Hotline provides an alternative channel for you to communicate your concerns. This allows any person to report activities that may involve unethical or otherwise inappropriate activity or behavior in violation of Northeastern University’s established policies and procedures. All reports submitted to EthicsPoint are protected under the [Whistleblower Policy.](https://policies.northeastern.edu/policy109/)
You may file a report to Northeastern University online or telephone.
