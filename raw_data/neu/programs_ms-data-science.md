Concentrations 
Choose between two concentrations: computer science or engineering. Both start with the same foundational courses, covering data management, programming, algorithms, and machine learning. The concentrations then dive into different applications through specialization courses.
Computer Science (Khoury College of Computer Sciences) 
Engineering Theory and Modeling Concentration (College of Engineering)  
By comparison, the engineering concentration focuses on applying data techniques to tangible challenges in fields like renewable energy, chemical processing, or urban infrastructure. You might use data models to predict equipment failures in manufacturing plants, optimize traffic flow in smart cities, or analyze environmental data to improve wastewater treatment.
Unique features 
  * Our program meets F-1 international student status requirements.
  * This is an interdisciplinary program between Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
  * Choose between two concentrations: computer science (Khoury College of Computer Sciences) and engineering theory and modeling (College of Engineering).
  * Courses are tailored toward technically or mathematically trained students.
  * Elective courses allow you to explore what interests you.


Career outlook 
After you successfully complete your master’s in data science are qualified to seek jobs as:
  * Data scientist
  * Machine learning engineer
  * Applications architect
  * Enterprise architect
  * Data architect
  * Infrastructure architect
  * Data engineer
  * Business intelligence developer
  * Data analyst


Employees with data science expertise are sought out in every industry, not just in technology. “Data scientists are highly educated—88 percent have at least a master’s degree and 46 percent have PhDs—and while there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist,” reports KDnuggets, a leading website on Big Data.
