## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’s [Graduate Certificate in International Business](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/international-business-certificate/?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=gcib) helps students cultivate a global mindset and develop the cultural agility required to lead in an increasingly globalized business world.
In just four courses—with the option to take a fifth to deepen their knowledge base—students study international trade issues, legal and political considerations for decision making, international currency markets, and significant cultural and ethical issues. Depending on their chosen electives, students explore topics such as competing in emerging markets or issues affecting global supply chain design.
