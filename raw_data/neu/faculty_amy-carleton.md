#  AmyCarleton
Part-Time Lecturer in English 
Amy Carleton’s academic research focuses on online communities as well as the intersection of race and digital culture. Outside of academia, her essays and articles have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Boston Globe, The Atlantic, New York Magazine, The LA Review of Books, NPR, and others.
Both a music lover and advocate for knowledge equity, she is currently bridging her personal and academic interests by collaborating on a series of multi-city community outreach projects that use music as a vehicle to empower a more diverse editor base for Wikipedia and address content gaps on the encyclopedia. She is also working on a book about Prince fan culture.
Carleton also serves on the executive board of the Boston Art & Music Soul (BAMS) Fest, a local nonprofit that aims to break down racial and social barriers to arts, music, and culture within Greater Boston.
