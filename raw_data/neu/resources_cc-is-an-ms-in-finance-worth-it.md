## What is a Master of Science in Quantitative Finance?

Graduates of an MS in Quantitative Finance program have the expertise to apply sophisticated quantitative models to solve complex financial problems and make informed decisions. Offered full-time on our Boston campus, this program provides dynamic and abundant opportunities in innovation and tech. 
An MS in Quantitative Finance can also be combined with an MBA to develop sharp financial acumen, as well as a deep understanding of the technology driving the rapidly changing finance industry. This [MS in Quantitative Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/part-time-ms-finance-mba/) dual degree program, also STEM-designated, prepares you for leadership roles that call for expertise in analytics and technologies like AI and machine learning. 
## What is a Master of Science in Fintech Management?

## How can a finance degree help your career? 
A master's in a finance field can propel your career with advanced financial skills, specialized knowledge, and an expanded professional network. Some programs integrate experience-based opportunities where you can apply what you learn in the classroom to real-world settings, like the D'Amore-McKim finance programs. Students can earn credits and experience by managing the [360 Huntington Fund](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/360-huntington-fund/), with opportunities like networking with peers and developing managerial and analytical skills for a real mutual fund. Students can also earn their Bloomberg certification through the [Bloomberg Business Lab](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/bloomberg-business-lab/bloomberg-certifications/), free for members of the Northeastern community on our Boston campus. 
Other highlights of experience-powered learning include [graduate co-ops](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-career-center/students/experience-fueled-learning/graduate-co-op/),[Community Impact Initiatives](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-career-center/students/experience-fueled-learning/community-impact-initiatives/) and [corporate residencies](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-career-center/students/experience-fueled-learning/damore-mckim-corporate-residency/). Some full-time finance programs, like the Master's in Quantitative Finance, offer candidates the opportunity to apply for a [graduate co-op](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-career-center/students/experience-fueled-learning/graduate-co-op/). Students work part- or full-time at an organization, earning experience and getting paid to do so. Dual degree programs like the [MS in Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-finance-mba) and [MS in Quantitative Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-quantitative-finance-mba/) programs offer students the opportunity to complete a [corporate residency](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-career-center/students/experience-fueled-learning/damore-mckim-corporate-residency/). Like a graduate co-op, students work full-time at an organization and earn a salary. Residencies last for three, six, or 12 months, as opposed to the 12–16-week duration of a graduate co-op. These are great ways to level up your resume and develop skills you might not in the classroom, so you can hit the ground running when you begin applying to jobs. 
A master's degree in finance can also open doors to higher-level positions and greater earning potential in finance, investment banking, corporate finance, and related fields. In May 2023, the median annual wage for business and financial occupations was $79,050, which is 64% higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $48,060 [according to BLS Data](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/). Professionals with master's degrees typically earn above-average salaries, further boosting earning potential.
