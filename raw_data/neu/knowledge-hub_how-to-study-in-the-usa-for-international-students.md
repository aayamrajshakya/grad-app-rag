If you’re an international student looking for educational opportunities in the U.S., you’re not alone. International enrollment has surpassed pre-pandemic levels, with more than [one million](https://opendoorsdata.org/annual-release/international-students/#key-findings) students from more than 210 countries joining American students at U.S.-based institutions in the 2022–2023 school year. And at Northeastern, you will be surrounded by others sharing a similar journey. Northeastern is home to nearly 21,000 international students—making us the second-largest host institution in the U.S.
Yet, between student visas, the application process, and cultural differences, some may second-guess their resolve to experience American university life. With our comprehensive guide on how to study in the USA, you’ll be well prepared and on your way to international student status.
## Applying to an American university
Applying to universities in the U.S. can feel complicated for all students, even those already based in the U.S. Here are some steps you can take to make your educational journey abroad as seamless as possible.
### 1. Start developing your skills
Since U.S. universities can be competitive, it’s important to develop your skill set as you begin the process of studying abroad. In addition to relevant language skills, you should also sharpen your critical thinking, communication (written and verbal), and time and resource management skills.
### 2. Research colleges
Searching for the right program among American colleges is all about finding the right fit for you. Depending on your priorities, this might mean a college:
  * Offers a degree program that interests you.
  * Accepts international students with a variety of cultural backgrounds to create a global community.
  * Facilitates sports and other activities that interest you and permit international student participation.
  * Is located in an ideal climate and living environment.


To ensure a good fit and continued success, it’s important to research colleges before finalizing your list. If you don’t, you run the risk of attending a school that doesn’t align with your personal and professional interests.
### 3. Connect with institutions before applying
One of the most helpful steps you can take in this process (that many applicants overlook) is reaching out to institutions before applying. Most universities have a dedicated admissions office that fields incoming queries from prospective international students. Consider reaching out and asking them about available resources, such as:
  * Career support
  * Scholarship opportunities
  * Mental health counseling
  * Global student services


Another way to get connected with institutions of interest is to reach out to faculty, alumni, or current students through your personal network or mutual connections. If you don’t have any, don’t worry.
“Reaching out to a relevant department, or even professors when possible, is a really good place to start,” says Tomo Yamamoto, director of international enrollment marketing at Northeastern University. Generally, universities are competing with each other for great candidates to apply to their programs—particularly international students with interesting backgrounds—so don’t hesitate to reach out and ask for more inside perspectives.
### 4. Consider the requirements
In your research, you’ll come across different requirements for different universities in the application and enrollment process. Many of these requirements apply to all students, international and otherwise. For example, while most universities are now test-optional as a result of the pandemic, some colleges still require scores from a standardized test (e.g., SAT, ACT, or GRE) as part of the application process.
As an international student, here will likely be additional prerequisites, such as the TOEFL or IELTS exams. These tests, which are meant to demonstrate proficiency in English, are common application requirements for international students.
### 5. Obtain your student visa
[Securing your student visa](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/news/how-to-apply-us-student-visa/) can be a long process, but a good institution will have the resources to guide you. For example, Northeastern provides step-by-step instructions for those applying for an [F-1 student visa](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/f-1-visa-process/) and [J-1 student visa](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/visa-application/j-1-student-visa-process/), depending on whether you’re an incoming full-time international student or on an exchange program with a government, organization, or university sponsorship. Look into the first steps of obtaining your student visa; usually, it will be to submit visa-supporting documents, such as Form I-20, Form DS-2019, and a valid passport.
## Maintaining your status
Joining a university in the U.S. is only the start of your journey. Once abroad, it’s essential to maintain your status of full-time, on-ground enrollment at your institution to ensure your visa remains valid and you can legally remain in the country. Remember, failure to do so can result in serious consequences.
The good news is that most institutions have a dedicated department to ensure their international students meet their visa requirements and maintain valid immigration status. As an international student, it’s important to reach out to the Office of Global Services or equivalent resource to make sure you’re doing everything needed to maintain your status.
The full-time credit conditions vary slightly by institution, but generally, they require a certain number of class hours or credits for the term, a certain level of performance in those classes, and a certain percentage of in-person course enrollment. For example, according to Northeastern’s Office of Global Services, [guidelines on maintaining status](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/) for undergraduate students include a minimum of 12 credit hours per term and a maximum of one online course. However, because these requirements are different at each university, it’s critical that you reach out to your dedicated office.
## Challenges of studying in the USA
Moving to and living in a new country can be challenging, especially when studying abroad. However, with proper preparation and the right tools, you can overcome these obstacles.
### Cost of living
Prospective international students should be aware of the cost of living in the U.S. Cities like New York and San Francisco are infamous for their inflated housing prices and high cost of living. In addition to these costs, tuition for U.S. universities in these cities also runs high. International students who maintain F-1 visa status may be eligible for on-campus work, which can help you fund your education. Continually check on-campus job postings to see what’s available.
“The tuition and other related costs are public on the university website,” says Yamamoto. “Cost of living can vary depending on each student’s lifestyle and preferences.” However, both of these aspects add up to a total investment in your education abroad, so it’s important to research return-on-investment (ROI) prospects of your degree as a part of your preparation process. Look into potential job opportunities that support work visas, offer a rewarding average salary, and project positive job market predictions to ensure you’ll have ROI-positive options when you graduate.
### Applying for a visa
Your individual situation can affect your visa application process in different ways. For instance, politics and global current events might impact how long it takes to get a visa. In extreme cases, this can even affect whether you are eligible to receive one. It’s important to apply for the relevant visa in a timely manner to prepare for any unexpected roadblocks.
“International students can check the U.S. embassy website to receive more up-to-date information from the U.S. government about student visas and the application process,” says Yamamoto. Resources like these can give you a better understanding of timelines, potential issues, and more.
### Cultural differences
It can be difficult to adapt to cultural differences. People might speak differently than you’re used to, come off as rude or loud, or expect different social norms from you. In class, it could be difficult to speak up at the right time, or it may take a little longer to make friends than you’d like.
But as every immigrant, ex-pat, and international student will inevitably tell you, it always gets better. In fact, assimilating into and learning about a new culture is what makes living abroad so exciting and enriching. Celebrating cultural differences is an essential part of studying in a foreign country.
At Northeastern, there are many [student organizations](https://csi.sites.northeastern.edu/) where you can connect with peers with similar interests while safely expanding your horizons and easing your transition. The university also has dedicated support services and events to help international students succeed and feel welcome on campus, including:
