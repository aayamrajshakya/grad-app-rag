## What makes Align different
Learn about the successful collaboration between Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Align students, and what makes it different: “We’re not just bringing in trained engineers. We’re bringing a set of folks who have a different set of perspectives, a different set of experiences. They bring a fresh understanding — a fresh set of eyes,” says Wayne Duso, former AWS vice president.
## How the Align program works
## Flexibility and connections that work for you
It takes both skills and connections to land a top job in tech. That’s why our online program includes three short in-person residencies — with travel and room and board included in tuition — at the beginning, middle, and end of the online bridge portion of the program. During these residencies, which are hosted at three of our campuses, you’ll have opportunities to build community, get in-person support, and put what you’ve learned into practice with real-world projects in a campus setting. 
From there, you can shape the format and pace of your online program in a way that fits into your work and family life: Transition to in-person learning, full or part time, at one of our eight campuses offering the Align program, or continue the online program.

## From military pilot to CS professional
Benji Northrop was a military pilot looking for more work-life balance when he joined the Align program. Now, he says, its model of fully asynchronous classes and “commitment from the school from start to finish” allows him to spend more time with his family while feeling fully supported in his program.
