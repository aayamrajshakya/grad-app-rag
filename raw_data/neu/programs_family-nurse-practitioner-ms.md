Students are required to be on campus one weekend per clinical semester, and to attend the two Intensive Workshops. This offers coursework online while you attend your clinical rotations locally. Students in the online program will come to Northeastern’s campus twice during the program for clinical intensives to connect with faculty, perfect clinical skills, and prepare for certification exams. 
Upon completion of the family nurse practitioner program, graduates are eligible to sit for all national certification exams in their area of practice.
The program in which you are enrolled prepares you to practice in any state, based on the information posted on each state’s nursing licensure website.

## Experiential Learning and Clinical Placement
Clinical practicum is available in a variety of urban and rural settings. This may include, but is not limited to:
  * Hospitals
  * Urgent care clinics
  * Primary care offices
  * Community health centers


Preceptorship is one to one. Preceptors may be advanced nurse practitioners or physicians. The student will manage a caseload with increasing complexity and independence as the program progresses. 
Reliable transportation is necessary to access clinical practicum locations. This is the responsibility of the student.
### Online Program Experiential Learning
Northeastern will partner with students to identify clinical placements within 100 miles of their home. The online students will be responsible for identifying and proposing a clinical preceptor 
We’ll work to ensure clinical affiliations are in place but require 6 months to expedite contracts
