## Learn the tools and processes of experience design
In our increasingly complex and tech-driven world, organizations need business and design professionals who can help them create meaningful products and services that respond to today's challenges and opportunities. 
Our innovative MBA x Experience Design concentration—offered in collaboration with [Northeastern's College of Arts, Media and Design](https://camd.northeastern.edu/) (CAMD)—will help you gain skills in the tools, technologies, and processes of experience design and prepare you to build better customer experiences for brands, products, and services. Experience Design helps spur innovation and develop creative and unique responses to societal and organizational challenges. 
Guided by CAMD professors, you'll take courses in design systems, human behavior, and prototyping. You'll learn to conduct user research, analyze human behavior, identify opportunities to improve experiences, and create models of artifacts, environments, and interactive systems. 
A background in design is not required. This concentration is open to anyone interested in designing experiences that can make a positive impact in this world.
