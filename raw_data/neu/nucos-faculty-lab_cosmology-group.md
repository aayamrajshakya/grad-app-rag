#  Cosmology Group 
We aim to unravel the mysteries of the Universe, including the nature of dark energy and dark matter, the laws of gravity on the largest scales, and the earliest moments after the Big Bang. To study these topics, we model and analyze observations of galaxies and other astrophysical objects, especially from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory.
