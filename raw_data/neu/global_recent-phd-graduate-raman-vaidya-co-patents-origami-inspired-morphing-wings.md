As a PhD student in mechanical engineering at Northeastern, recent graduate Raman Vaidya collaborated with Professor Moneesh Upmanyu on innovative research that merges origami design with aerospace engineering. Their work recently earned a U.S. patent for a morphing wing prototype that can fold and shift shape mid-flight—an approach that could lead to more fuel-efficient and adaptable aircraft. Vaidya contributed to the project as part of Upmanyu’s research team, helping to develop a novel internal structure that allows the wing to transform rapidly and efficiently. The design is currently in the computational modeling phase, with the team aiming to move toward real-world applications.
