Toggle Accordion  Graduate Certificates 
Over 15 [graduate certificates](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=Graduate%20Certificate) are available to provide students the opportunity to develop a specialization in an area of their choice. Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
#### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Environmental Engineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/cert-gel/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16 semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 36-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 20 hours of advisor-approved environmental engineering technical courses.

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. Northeastern is an R1 research institution, rated among universities with the highest research activity.
The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 3,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepare students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
Research opportunities may be available within and outside the department and college, with involvement and access to both civil and environmental engineering and interdisciplinary research centers, facilities and state-of-the-art research laboratories such as George J. Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, Northeastern University Innovation Campus in Burlington, Center for High-rate Nanofacturing, The Barnett Institute of Chemical, and Biological Analysis, Environmental Chemistry, Analytical and Biotechnology/Genomics Laboratories, among others.

## Program Goals
Educational Objectives
A student completing the Master of Science (MS) in Environmental Engineering will display a high level of engineering knowledge in a broad range of environmental engineering topics with the paradigm shifts and reforms visions in environmental monitoring, regulation and treatment technology development, with a primary focus on the study of environmental pollution and treatment, resources and energy recovery, and environmental and human health. Upon completion of the degree, students will possess the skills to assess the quality of water, soil, and air resources with respect to environmental pollution regulations; to understand the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence pollution behavior in the environment; and to engineer treatment processes that maintain or improve environmental quality.
Graduate coursework is designed to instruct students on environmental science fundamentals and engineering design principles, to improve problem-solving skills, to utilize state-of-the-art data analysis and computational analysis, and to enhance oral and written communication skills.
