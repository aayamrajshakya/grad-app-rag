## Overview
The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Industrial Engineering is awarded to students who demonstrate high academic achievement and research competence in the field of industrial engineering. To earn a PhD, a student must complete approved and advanced course work and submit and defend an original dissertation of independent research. The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering expects all successful doctoral candidates to show depth of knowledge and research innovation in their chosen field of specialization.
The MIE department admits applicants to the PhD program either directly after earning a suitable bachelor’s degree (i.e., bachelor’s entry) or after earning a master’s degree (i.e., advanced entry).

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real world engineering challenges. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a Co-op Program for Graduate Students. Through this program students gain industry experience in a wide variety of organizations, from large companies to entrepreneurial start-ups, while helping to finance their education. Students can also participate in an internship or the university’s [Experiential PhD](https://phd.northeastern.edu/network/experientialphd/) program.
