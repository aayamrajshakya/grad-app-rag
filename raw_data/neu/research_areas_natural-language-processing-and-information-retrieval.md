# Natural Language Processing at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Helping computers understand and work with human language
Natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval research helps bridge the gap between the ways people use language every day and the way computer programs work with it. Human languages are vastly complex with varied syntax, grammar, usage, and contexts. NLP research aims to help computers understand this complexity and interact with users successfully, with inputs and outputs that sound like regular conversation. 
Information retrieval (IR) research focuses on the searching and retrieving of content from large sets of data — for instance, text collections with millions of documents. This presents significant computational challenges, including understanding the nature of the text in the collections, how to categorize it, and how to make it searchable. Khoury College researchers are shedding light on how using natural language approaches to analyze how we search could improve results.

## Building innovative semantics systems
Khoury College researchers in NLP and IR work in a range of areas, for instance building the knowledge that will make search engines more effective and AI smarter about context, and enable tools that provide automated services like mental health counseling to be more conversational and helpful. Khoury researchers also do breakthrough work in digital humanities, helping improve the search function for large collections of digitized cultural resources.
Recent Khoury College research has the potential to help services like ChatGPT do a better job of summarizing medical content from multiple sources, making it more reliable and useful to nonexpert users looking for information.

Can large language models synthesize medical information? 
##  Can large language models synthesize medical information? 
Northeastern investigators used computational linguistics to test whether a large language model, GPT-3, could understand and summarize medical research papers. Although GPT-3 did a good job summarizing single papers written in plain language, it struggled to combine information accurately from multiple studies.

Creating a computer agent to provide palliative care 
##  Creating a computer agent to provide palliative care 
The Northeastern Relational Agents used relied on a range of approaches including natural language processing research to create a conversational agent that can help terminally ill patients lessen suffering and improve quality life.

Evaluating the zero-shot robustness of instruction-tuned language models 
##  Evaluating the zero-shot robustness of instruction-tuned language models 
Users working with AI tools based on large language models can fine tune results by giving them specific instructions, even when the model hasn’t been trained on specific examples (zero-shot training). However, researchers at Northeastern have discovered that LLM models struggle to provide the right information if instructions have even minor changes in phrasing. In response, they are developing a way to help models understand the core meaning behind instructions, regardless of wording.
