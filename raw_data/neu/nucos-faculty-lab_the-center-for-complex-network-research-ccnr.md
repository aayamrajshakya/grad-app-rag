#  Center for Complex Network Research (CCNR) 
The Center’s objective is simple: think networks. Research focuses on how networks emerge/evolve, how they look, and how they impact our understanding of complex systems. CCNR’s research has developed to unexpected areas, including the topology of the World Wide Web; complex networks inside the cell, and the Internet’s Achilles’ Heel.
