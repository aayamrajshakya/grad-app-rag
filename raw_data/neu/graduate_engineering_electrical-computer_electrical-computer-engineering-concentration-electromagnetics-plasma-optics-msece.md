2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
For program contact information, please visit [this website](https://ece.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/ms-elee/). 
The master's degree program in electrical and computer engineering offers in-depth coursework within the concentration-choice-related areas. The curriculum is integrated and intensive and is built on state-of-the-art research, taught by faculty who are experts in their areas.
## Excluded Courses for All MSECE Concentrations
Students cannot take excluded courses as part of the MSECE program and may not petition to take these courses, as any petition to take these courses will be automatically rejected. Courses from the following subject areas may not count toward any concentration within the MSECE program: CSYE, DAMG, INFO, TELE. Select CS courses are also excluded from all MSECE concentrations. Please see the program requirements tab and your college administrator for more information. 
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Master's Degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering with Concentration in Electromagnetics, Plasma, and Optics with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer Engineering with Concentration in Electromagnetics, Plasma, and Optics in addition to earning a [Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 40-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 24 semester hours of advisor-approved electromagnetics, plasma, and optics technical courses. For students who concurrently enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, 8 semester hours of the certificate project may be applied to this program’s thesis requirements.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
