2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The postbaccalaureate certificate is designed to give students a solid foundation in the mathematical and theoretical underpinnings of computer science, including the areas of discrete mathematics, basic programming, data structures, object-oriented programming, algorithms, and computer systems. The goal of the certificate is to provide foundational knowledge in computer science that is valuable in both the workplace for career advancement, as well as to those looking to move into graduate programs within the discipline. 
The courses in the Postbaccalaureate Certificate in Computer Science will serve as the foundational premaster's courses in the Align program. Students that successfully complete the five certificate courses with a B in each course or better will be eligible to matriculate into the Master of Science in Computer Science program.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
