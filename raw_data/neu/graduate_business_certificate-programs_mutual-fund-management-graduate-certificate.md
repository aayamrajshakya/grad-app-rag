Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’ [Graduate Certificate in Mutual Fund Management](http://www.damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/certificates/mutual-fund-management?utm_medium=website&utm_source=catalog&utm_campaign=gcmfm) helps students build the skills to become knowledgeable asset managers that create value by spotting opportunities and capitalizing on growth.
In just four courses—with the option to take a fifth course to deepen your knowledge base—students learn the essentials of managing funds, including allocating assets, managing risk, and complying with regulations. Depending on the electives chosen, students explore critical topics in greater depth, such as market analysis or fixed-income securities.
Students may enroll in our Graduate Certificate in Mutual Fund Management for part-time study.
