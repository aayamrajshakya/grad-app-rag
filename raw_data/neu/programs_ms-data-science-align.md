Program overview 
##  Start your data science career 
You don’t need a background in technology to have a future in it. Technology thrives on new, diverse, and unexpected ideas—it needs new perspectives. Our Align program lets you earn a master’s degree in data science no matter what field your bachelor’s degree is from.
The Align curriculum is specifically designed for incoming students without any prior programming experience. You’ll begin with two bridge semesters that help you transition into the study of data science. You’ll have access to a network of enhanced academic support, including advising, teaching assistants, and tutoring, as well as an Align-specific career prep seminar designed to help you transition from your current field into the world of tech.

Concentrations 
Choose between two concentrations: computer science or engineering. Both start with the same foundational courses, covering data management, programming, algorithms, and machine learning. The concentrations then dive into different applications through specialization courses.
Computer Science (Khoury College of Computer Sciences) 
Engineering Theory and Modeling Concentration (College of Engineering)  
By comparison, the engineering concentration focuses on applying data techniques to tangible challenges in fields like renewable energy, chemical processing, or urban infrastructure. You might use data models to predict equipment failures in manufacturing plants, optimize traffic flow in smart cities, or analyze environmental data to improve wastewater treatment.
Unique features 
  * As an interdisciplinary program between Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Engineering, Align MS in Data Science combines expertise across mathematics, computing, and data engineering.
  * Northeastern’s flagship campus builds on Boston’s legacy of innovation and is set in a hub of healthcare, education, finance, business, biotechnology, and the life sciences. Students take what they learn in the classroom to address real-world challenges facing local nonprofits, for-profits, and government agencies.
  * Choose between two concentrations: computer science (Khoury College of Computer Sciences) and engineering theory and modeling (College of Engineering).
  * Gain theoretical foundations and extensive hands-on experience in the field, including data acquisition, storage, analysis, probabilistic modeling, model deployment, and presentation.
  * Shape your curriculum beyond your core requirements with a wide range of interdisciplinary courses, including computer science, engineering, life sciences, physics, social sciences, and business.
  * Through our co-op and internship opportunities, you can bring what you learn in class to the real world and the skills you learn in the real world back to class.


Career outlook 
Nearly every industry needs people with data science skills.
In the last year, there were roughly 25,000 job postings in the U.S. seeking data scientists. Of these, 48% required or preferred candidates with a master’s degree, and 60% required or preferred candidates with a graduate degree (master’s or doctoral).
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the demand for data science skills will drive a 28% rise in employment in the field through 2026.
Our graduates have gone on to a range of exciting careers across every industry, including Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Quantitative Researcher, Machine Learning Engineer, and Natural Language Processing/OCR engineer.
Experiential learning 
Graduate students typically have an experiential work opportunity following their second semester. This could be a six- to eight-month co-op or a three- to four-month internship. Those who initially experience co-op may have the opportunity to seek an internship for the following summer, or vice versa.
Student participation in experiential education provides enhanced:
  * Learning, technical expertise, and occupational knowledge
  * Confidence, maturity, and self-knowledge
  * Job-seeking and job-success skills
  * Networking opportunities within your desired career path


Northeastern’s co-op program is based on a unique educational strategy that recognizes that classroom learning only provides some of the skills students will need to succeed in their professional lives. Our administration, faculty, and staff are dedicated to the university’s mission to “educate students for a life of fulfillment and accomplishment.” Co-op is closely integrated with our course curriculum and our advising system. The team of graduate co-op faculty within the Khoury College of Computer Sciences provides support for students in preparing for and succeeding in their co-ops.
