2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Facing the threat of privatization and for-profit competition, nonprofit organizations are challenged to find leaders who not only possess keen business and managerial skills but can also effect change at a community or social level. Being successful in this dynamic and rewarding field requires strong leadership, managerial and interpersonal skills, as well as in-depth knowledge of fundraising, marketing, program development, and governance issues.
Integrating theoretical approaches with practical applications, the Master of Science in Nonprofit Management seeks to prepare you for a leadership position in a not-for-profit university, hospital, charity, foundation, or religious organization. Upon completion of this nonprofit degree, you emerge well equipped to embark on a career in nonprofit management—prepared, and inspired, to make a meaningful impact. 
The mission of the Master of Science in Nonprofit Management at the College of Professional Studies is to offer courses that further develop the students' knowledge, skills, talent, and abilities. Faculty in the program support students' development goals through action-oriented courses that link theoretical learning to practical application. Nonprofit management courses aim to prepare students to be mission-driven executive leaders, managers, employees, and board members in public and private nonprofit organizations. 
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
