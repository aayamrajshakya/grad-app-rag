Program overview 
##  Help nonprofits thrive 
The Master of Science in Nonprofit Management integrates theoretical approaches with practical applications. You’ll take action-oriented coursework with faculty dedicated to prepare you for a leadership position in not-for-profit universities, hospitals, charities, foundations, nongovernmental organizations, or religious organizations.
Nonprofit organizations are challenged to thrive in a constantly changing social and business environment, with limited resources and complex needs. Successful nonprofit organizations are defined by leaders who possess keen business and managerial skills and can effect change at a community or social level. Rather than a generic MBA program, our master’s in nonprofit management is built to closely align with the core competencies of fundraising, policy, and strategic management.
