#  PlusOne Program Economics 
The PlusOne accelerated Master’s Program in Economics provides the opportunity for Northeastern’s undergraduate majors to complete both the undergraduate degree program (BS or BA) and the professional master’s program (MS) in economics in less time than if the programs were completed sequentially.
## How does the PlusOne program work?
Part of the MS program is completed as an undergraduate and part of it as a graduate student. Upon completion of the bachelor’s degree requirements and earning their BS or BA degree, students are then considered graduate students. As a graduate student, the remaining 4 graduate level courses need to be completed to earn the MS degree.
  * 8 graduate level courses to complete 
    * 4 core courses completed as an undergraduate student
    * 4 electives completed as a graduate student
