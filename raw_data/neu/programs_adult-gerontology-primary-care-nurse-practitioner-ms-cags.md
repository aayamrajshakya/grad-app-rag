## The need for highly engaged and clinically excellent nurses has never been more profound.
The Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner Program is a specialty track within the MS in Nursing program that prepares nurse practitioners to provide quality care to adults/older adults.
This specialty focuses on health promotion, disease prevention, and management of chronic and sub-acute conditions. The AGPCNP practices in a variety of settings, including primary care centers, disease-specific clinics, long-term care facilities, and inpatient specialty services. Although the name of the certification includes “primary care,” our program prepares students to excel in a wide range of fields and settings.

Our program is offered fully online, with a mix of synchronous and asynchronous* courses. This offers flexibility in completing coursework online while you attend your clinical rotations locally. Students will come to Northeastern’s campus three times during the program for two-day clinical intensives, where they’ll have the opportunity to connect with faculty, perfect clinical skills, and prepare for certification exams. 
In addition to the traditional Master’s Primary Care Nursing program, we offer a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS) for nurses who possess an MS degree in Nursing with a nurse practitioner specialty.
Upon completion of the program, graduates are eligible to sit for either of the available AGPCNP national certification exams (ANCC or AANP).
The program prepares you to practice in any state, based on the information posted on each state’s nursing licensure website. If you have questions or concerns regarding professional licensure, please contact our program director [Lauren Spendley](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#3b5715484b5e555f575e427b5554494f535e5a484f5e4955155e5f4e).
*Asynchronous refers to a recorded class you can do in your own time, vs. synchronous which refers to courses that are attended at specific times.
