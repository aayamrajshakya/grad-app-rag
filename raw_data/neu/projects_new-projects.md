### What is a DSG project?
DSG projects are the groups and activities to which DSG provides direct tangible support. Our projects typically arise from activities centered at Northeastern University; we do not generally offer services for hire. However, projects may include collaborators at other institutions and in special cases may arise from larger community initiatives for which Northeastern is a natural home.
To ensure that our effort is distributed fairly, and to enable us to set priorities, we ask potential projects to use our application process, below. This enables us to learn more about what you need from DSG and also helps us organize our work.
### What are the benefits of being a DSG project?
DSG offers affiliated projects many different forms of [support](http://dsg.northeastern.edu/current-project-resources/), including:
  * server space
  * access to specialized software tools and DSG lab computers
  * installations and configuration of systems like Omeka, WordPress, Listserv, MediaWiki
  * time and effort from DSG staff, including programming, project management, grant-writing, information design, and other activities.


Basic services are provided on request. More advanced services such as development effort involve a proposal process, since DSG has a limited staff. The standard tools and systems we use are maintained by DSG to keep our projects vital and functional for the long term.
### What do we expect from DSG projects?
Our biggest request is that you stay in touch! We would like each project to meet with us for activities like:
  * Developing and maintaining a [data management plan](https://dsg.northeastern.edu/data-management-plans/)
  * Partnering on [grant applications](http://dsg.northeastern.edu/services/grant-support/)
  * Meet with us a regular basis to check-in on your projects progress and goals


### How do I apply?
Interested in becoming a DSG project? Contact us and let’s discuss your project! A member of the DSG will contact you to discuss your project and its needs. Following that discussion, you can request specific services such as server space, Omeka installations, and so forth.
