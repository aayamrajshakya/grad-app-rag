2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
With the quality and ease of use of digital video camcorders, anyone can capture moving images, but the result is like a Stradivarius violin: It takes training to make music. The Graduate Certificate in Digital Video is a hands-on introduction to digital video technologies, as well as an examination of the social, cultural, and political implications of moving-image production in the digital age. Students have an opportunity to gain competency in digital production and postproduction while exploring various formal, conceptual, and structural strategies. Students will also have an opportunity to learn to generate digital video that communicates effectively and inventively, in preparation for positions in the creative industries of gaming, design, and media production.
