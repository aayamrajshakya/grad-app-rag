The PhD in Economics is a small and focused program, with students concentrating in one of two areas of specialization: Industrial Organization, Competition Policy, and Regulatory Economics and Labor Economics. The program is applied in nature and is designed for students who are considering work in the government and private sectors as well as academic jobs.

Fewer than ten students enter the PhD in Applied Economics program each year. Students may concentrate in either Industrial Organization (also called Industrial Economics and which covers Competition Policy and Regulatory Economics); or Labor Economics. Each field is covered in two semester courses at the PhD level. Admission from the Bachelor’s level requires taking the MS core courses and two additional elective courses, plus the PhD requirements.
The field of Industrial Organization analyzes firm behavior, evaluates the performance of markets, and devises appropriate policy responses when markets are not performing well. By developing techniques for examining the structure, conduct, and performance of markets, it bridges economic theory and the real world. In addition, it helps to develop and implement antitrust and regulatory policies to remedy failures of those markets.
The field of Labor Economics analyzes the neoclassical labor market, covering such topics as the supply of labor from the perspective of the individual and the family, human capital, the demand for labor, market equilibrium, and the determination and distribution of wages and earnings. Theoretical and empirical issues surrounding current topics in labor economics are examined, and may include discrimination, efficiency wage theory, labor legislation, life cycle analysis and the use of microdata (panel studies), search behavior, intergenerational earnings mobility, and employment and training policies.
In addition to industrial organization and labor, students take field courses, when available, in other research areas. Development economics is an example of one such area.
