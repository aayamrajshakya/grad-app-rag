Program overview 
##  Advanced remote sensing skills 
In practice, remote sensing is the utilization at a distance (as from aircraft, space shuttle, spacecraft, satellite, or ship) of any device for gathering information about the environment. The term “remote sensing” is most often applied to terrestrial and weather observations, but can be applied to planetary environments and astronomy. Remote sensing is applicable to many other situations including land-use change, pollution tracking, land use and planning, transportation systems, and military observation.
The Graduate Certificate in Remote Sensing provides expertise in remote sensing theory, hands-on exposure to remote sensing software and hardware, and an understanding of how to extract pertinent data from remotely sensed datasets.
