2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern’s Master of Science in Biotechnology is a professional master's program, an innovative, nonthesis graduate degree. It combines advanced interdisciplinary training in biotechnology, biology, chemistry, and pharmaceutical sciences with the development of high-value business skills critical to success in today’s dynamic workplace. This program is designed to prepare graduates to innovate, collaborate, and lead as research, managerial, or technical professionals in a wide range of biotechnology specialties. The two-year program offers students the possibility to pursue one of ten concentrations to further their knowledge in a specific topical area of the field. 
## Concentrations
### Agricultural Biotechnology Concentration
The agricultural concentration goes beyond the production of biological drugs and focuses on the key agricultural biotechnology (agritech) principles and methods used today. Students have an opportunity to learn the principles of agritech and the role they play in the concepts and fundamentals of agriculture today. The concentration addresses plant, animal, food, and ecological biotechnology. The learning of the students is reinforced by both lecture courses and project-driven laboratory experience that provides hands-on learning of modern agricultural methodologies. 
### Biodefense Concentration
The biodefense concentration is designed to prepare students for the initial homeland biodefense and bioterrorism response. Students have an opportunity to learn the microbiology and epidemiology of biological agents that are potential threats, identify and propose countermeasures, and develop expertise in response and recovery strategies and policies. The learning combines the foundational biotechnology courses with case-based and hands-on bioethical, biowarfare, and bioterrorism courses. 
### Biopharmaceutical Technologies and Analytics Concentration
The biopharmaceutical technologies and analytics track focuses on structures, variants and activities of biological molecules as well as how to convert purified proteins to biopharmaceutical drug products that are compatible for clinical use. Students learn the diversity of molecular forms derived from biological products, techniques to analyze and characterize these forms, and the impact of these structural changes on the safety and efficacy of biopharmaceuticals. The track addresses design of product formulation, development and implementation of drug product manufacturing processes, and relevant process technology, such as aseptic operations and freeze-drying, needed for drug product manufacturing. This is accomplished through both lecture courses and project-driven laboratory experiences that utilize analytical techniques and provide hands-on learning of formulation design and drug product process development. 
### Biotechnology Operations Concentration
The biotechnology operations track is an operationally inclusive concentration that offers relevant insights to the inner workings of a biotech company while preparing students for new entry or promotions to a variety of biotech functions. Students learn the principles of quality, regulatory science, process science and manufacturing, while integrating business and management skills with the science of biotechnology. The track covers the science behind compliance and the principles and practices of state-of-the-art biopharmaceutical manufacturing and quality operations, enabling students to move across positions in discovery, clinical operations, manufacturing, quality, regulatory affairs, and consulting for operations and operational strategy and/or remediations.
### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
### Master's Degree in Biotechnology with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Biotechnology in addition to earning a [Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The certificate program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. For students who concurrently enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, 6 semester hours of the certificate coursework may be applied to the general elective requirement of this program and to the elective requirement of any concentration.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
