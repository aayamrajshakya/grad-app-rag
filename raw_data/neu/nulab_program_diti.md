#  Digital IntegrationTeaching Initiative
A presentation on [Our Marathon](https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/) for an Advanced Writing in the Disciplines course
The Digital Integration Teaching Initiative (DITI) collaborates with faculty in the humanities and social sciences to introduce students to digital methods and skills at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.
We believe that every student, across all disciplines, needs basic computational skills to be successful in today’s world. The DITI team of graduate students, guided by faculty and staff leads, works with social science and humanities faculty to incorporate digital proficiencies into existing syllabi. Rather than adding additional skills or assignments to courses, we work with faculty to integrate digital skills that enhance existing course learning goals. The aim is not to turn all students into computer scientists but to teach skills that will help them be successful in their studies at Northeastern and in the academic and professional work they pursue.
