## Innovative Curriculum
Northeastern’s PhD program in Electrical Engineering offers the opportunity to pursue cutting-edge research in a broad range of areas such as: Signal and image processing; biomedical signal processing and brain-computer interface; pattern recognition; adaptive signal processing; wireless and underwater communications; information theory and coding; robust and distributed control; optics, photonics, acoustics, and magnetics sensors; radio frequency chip design; digital and mixed-signal integrated circuits; low-power very-large-scale integration; modeling and analysis of large scale power grids during normal operation and under faults; dc-dc converters, inverters, rectifiers, and ac-ac converters; as well as modulation techniques used in power electronics.
The PhD program is research-based with minimal and flexible course requirements which can be pursued as full-time or part-time. The exact nature of the program of study will vary among candidates depending on the dissertation subject area and the candidate’s preparation.
Applicants can enter the PhD program with either a BS or an MS degree in electrical engineering or a closely related field. Students entering the program with a BS degree need to also complete MS requirements, which includes selecting a concentration for the master’s component.

Toggle Accordion  Locations 
In addition to Boston, the PhD program is offered at the [Oakland, CA](https://oakland.northeastern.edu/) campus and at the [Roux Institute at Northeastern in Portland, Maine](https://phd.northeastern.edu/program/bioengineering/).
Situated in the vibrant heart of the city, our Boston, Massachusetts campus is strategically positioned within the biotechnology hub of the Greater Boston area, adjacent to Cambridge, Massachusetts start-ups and the Longwood Medical Area.
The Oakland, CA campus offers a range of engineering programs with a focus on experiential learning and connections to the Bay Area’s tech industry.
Nestled within the Roux Institute, our Portland, Maine campus boasts a sweeping view of Casco Bay. The Roux Institute fosters a dynamic entrepreneurial culture with many programs tailored for start-up founders and a dedicated emphasis on AI and technology-driven innovations.
Toggle Accordion  Graduate Program Deadlines 
  * Qualifying exam: Students who already hold an MS degree and matriculate in the fall semester must take the qualifying exam in the spring semester of their first year. Students matriculating in spring semester, or students who hold a BS degree and matriculate in the fall semester , can postpone the exam to the second spring semester. Those who fail the exam the first time, have one more chance to take the exam. These students must take the exam the next spring after their first attempt.
  * Research advisor: Students should have a research advisor one year after their matriculation.
  * Thesis committee: The Dissertation Committee must be formed not later than six months after passing the qualifying exam.
  * Comprehensive exam: The deadline for comprehensive exam is two years after passing the qualifying exam.
  * Dissertation defense: The dissertation defense should be scheduled at least one year after taking the comprehensive exam.

## Experiential Learning
With relationships with a number of high-tech firms, both start-ups and large multinational corporations, many PhD students have the opportunity to do an internship during their program. Often their advisor is instrumental in identifying the internship position, with a funding sponsor or research collaborator. Internships can be informally arranged for several months at any time during the calendar year.
PhD students can also take advantage of the more formally arranged co-op program which entails up to 8 months of work experience preceded by several professional development courses to prepare students. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program students gain professional experience, employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum. Northeastern has over 3,000 co-op employer partners. Additionally, students can participate in the university’s [Experiential PhD](https://phd.northeastern.edu/network/experientialphd/) program.
