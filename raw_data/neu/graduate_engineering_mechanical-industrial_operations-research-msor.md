The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) offers comprehensive research and educational programs for students pursuing the Master of Science in Operations Research (MSOR). OR deals with the application of scientific method to decision making. Its practitioners develop and solve mathematical and computer models of systems using optimization and statistical methods. OR methodologies are being used to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase profitability in all organizations whether in manufacturing, transportation, logistics and supply chains, healthcare, or financial institutions. Upon graduation, students who pursue this program may work in industry or may continue their studies by pursuing the PhD in Industrial Engineering. These extensive programs and coursework allow for the selection of a degree that meets a wide range of personal and professional goals. 
## General Degree Requirements
To be eligible for admission to any of the MS degree programs, a prospective student must hold a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, science, mathematics, or an equivalent field. Students in all master’s degree programs must complete a minimum of 32 semester hours of approved coursework (exclusive of any preparatory courses) with a minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.000. Students can complete a master's degree by pursuing any of one of the three tracks: coursework option, project option, and thesis option. Specific degree requirements for each of these tracks can be found under the Program Requirements tab. Students may pursue any program either on a full-time or part-time basis; however, certain restrictions may apply.
## Academic and Research Advisors
All nonthesis students are advised by the faculty advisor designated for their respective concentration or program. Students willing to pursue the thesis option must first find a research advisor within their first year of study. The research advisor will guide the students' thesis work, and thesis reader(s) may be assigned at the discretion of their research advisor. The research advisor must be a full-time or jointly appointed faculty. If the research advisor is outside the MIE department, before the thesis option can be approved, a faculty member with 51 percent or more appointments in the MIE department must be chosen as co-advisor, and a petition must be filed and approved by the co-advisor and the MIE Graduate Affairs Committee. Thesis option students are advised by the faculty advisor of their concentration before they select their research advisor(s). The research advisor and co-advisor must serve as thesis readers.
## Plan of Study and Course Selection
It is recommended that all new students attend orientation sessions held by the MIE department and the Graduate School of Engineering to acquaint themselves with the coursework requirements and research activities of the department as well as with the general policies, procedures, and expectations.
In order to receive proper guidance with their coursework needs, all MS students are strongly encouraged to complete and submit a fully signed Plan of Study (PS) to the department before enrolling in second-semester courses. This form not only helps the students manage their coursework but it also helps the department to plan for requested course offerings. The PS form may be modified at any time as the students progress in their degree programs. 
Students may also petition to waive a core course by demonstrating evidence of their having passed a similar approved IE or OR graduate course. In such situations, the students must first obtain approval from their academic advisor for the course(s) they are planning to substitute.
Students pursuing study or research under the guidance of a faculty member can choose project option by taking Master’s Project (OR 7945)
## Options for MS Students (coursework only, project, or thesis)
Students accepted into any of the MS programs in the MIE department can choose one of the three options: coursework only, project, or thesis. Please see the Program Requirements tab on the top menu of this page for more information. MS students who want to pursue project or thesis options must find, within the first year of their study, a faculty member or a research advisor who will be willing to direct and supervise a mutually agreed research project or MS thesis. Moreover, students who receive financial support from the university in the form of a research, teaching, or tuition assistantship must complete 8 semester hours of thesis option. 
Students who complete the thesis option must make a presentation of their thesis before approval by the department. The MS thesis presentation shall be publicly advertised at least one week in advance, and all faculty members and students may attend and participate. If deemed appropriate by the research advisor, other faculty members may be invited to serve as thesis readers to provide technical opinions and judge the quality of the thesis and presentation. 
## Change of Program/Concentration
Students enrolled in any of the MIE department programs or concentrations may change their current program or concentration no sooner than the beginning of their second full-time semester of study. In order for the program or concentration change request to be considered by the MIE Graduate Affairs Committee, the student must not be in the first semester of their current program, must have a 3.300 GPA, and have completed at least 8 semester hours of required coursework in their sought program at Northeastern.
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a graduate degree program in the College of Engineering have the opportunity to pursue an engineering graduate certificate in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. For more information please refer to [Graduate Certificate Programs](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
