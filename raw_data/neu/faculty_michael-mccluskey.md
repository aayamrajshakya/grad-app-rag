#  MichaelMcCluskey
Teaching Professor in English 
Michael McCluskey’s research looks at the technological changes of the 1920s and ’30s through studies of the film and literature of the period. He is particularly interested in the intersection of the history of technology and the history of education and uses documentary, educational, and amateur film to examine the integration of new technologies and the emergence of our own networked world.
His teaching draws on his interests in technology and design and includes literature and film from the early twentieth century to today, archival sources, recent work in media studies and critical access studies, and collaborations with the Huskiana Press and local institutions.
Before coming to Northeastern, he was a Lecturer in the CAS Writing Program at Boston University, Lecturer in English at the University of York (UK), and a Fellow at metaLAB (at) Harvard. He is co-editor of Rural Modernity in Britain (Edinburgh University Press, 2018) and co-editor of Aviation in the Literature and Culture of Interwar Britain (Palgrave, 2020). He is currently working on a co-edited collection on infrastructure and a monograph on 1930s documentary film.

#### ENGW 1111
Designed for students to study and practice writing in a workshop setting. Students read a range of texts in order to describe and evaluate the choices writers make and apply that knowledge to their own writing and explore how writing functions in a range of academic, professional, and public contexts. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to conduct research using primary and secondary sources; how to write for various purposes and audiences in multiple genres and media; and how to give and receive feedback, to revise their work, and to reflect on their growth as writers.
