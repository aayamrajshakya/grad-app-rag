## Concentration
Biomedical Devices and Bioimaging
The Biomedical Devices and Bioimaging concentration focuses on the design of biomedical devices, as well as biomedical imaging and signal processing. Students can select a coursework, project, or thesis option.
## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. The [cooperative education](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/) program, also known as co-op, is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 2,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepare students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
## Program Goals
Career Outlook
Bioengineering is a growing sector of the engineering profession. The aging of the U.S. population and the nationwide focus on health issues will help drive demand for better medical devices and equipment designed by biomedical engineers. Additionally, an increased concern for cost-effectiveness will boost demand for biomedical engineers, particularly in pharmaceutical and device manufacturing and related industries.
Employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers is projected to grow 7% from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations. The median annual wage for bioengineers and biomedical engineers was $100,730 in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
