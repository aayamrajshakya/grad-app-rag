2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Through this graduate certificate program, students explore the identificationand analysis of systems and processes relevant to their fields of study. Students have an opportunity to gain a fundamental understanding of considerations and methods for the safe design of engineered processes and to develop skills for creating computational models to represent and analyzehazardous scenarios.
This three-course graduate certificate seeks to provide students with skills to lead efforts within companies to plan and implement process safety designs that assist in meeting the regulatory requirements and confirming code compliance within an industrial firm in order to maintain the safety, health, and welfare of their employees and the public, as well as making industrial firms safer and profitable.
