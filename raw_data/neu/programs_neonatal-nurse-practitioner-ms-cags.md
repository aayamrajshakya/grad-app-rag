## The need for highly engaged and clinically excellent nurses has never been more profound.
This program prepares neonatal nurse practitioners to care for infants at high risk dues to low birth weights, complications from premature birth, heart abnormalities, infections, long-term health issues, or other conditions effecting very young infants. Neonates are infants less than four weeks old, but NNPs can care for children up to two years old.
Applicants are required to have at least two years full-time nursing experience in a level 3 or greater NICU before entering our MS program. As a registered nurse, you already have a significant base of nursing knowledge. The neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP) MS program focuses on advanced nursing knowledge and clinical practice.
