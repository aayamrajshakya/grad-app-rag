## Drive the Development of Sustainable Technologies
The Master of Science (MS) in Sustainability Engineering Leadership is a unique double-degree program from Northeastern University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and University College Dublin. It focuses on engineering design, development, and assessment of sustainable technologies, and is coupled with the engineering management and leadership skills needed to deploy the technologies in the marketplace.
The first year of the program is offered in Boston, and the second year in Dublin. Upon graduation, students earn an MS degree in Sustainability Engineering Leadership from both Northeastern University and University College Dublin. The program prepares graduates for in-demand senior technical sustainability positions in engineering and industrial firms, consultancies, and environmental organizations.

## Innovative Curriculum
Students develop the skills needed to quantify the sustainability of a product, process, or system; identify areas for improvement; and devise and manage measures for implementation to improve sustainability. They build the capacity to lead the implementation of sustainability principles and the processes within an organization through an understanding of technical requirements, quantitative skills to capture and assess relevant environmental performance data, and leadership and critical analysis skills for project management. Students select a concentration: Sustainability Assessment, or Energy & Climate Technologies.
Experiential learning is a core component of the program. All students pursue a research thesis or an engineering leadership challenge project in industry. Northeastern is an R1 top-tier research institution and the program partners with the established and highly competitive Gordon Institute for Engineering Leadership.

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. As part of the MS in Sustainability Engineering Leadership program, all students pursue a research thesis or an engineering leadership challenge project in industry. Northeastern is an R1 top-tier research institution and the program partners with the established and highly competitive Gordon Institute for Engineering Leadership.
Additionally, students have the opportunity to participate in Northeastern’s top-ranked [cooperative education program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/). Also known as a “co-op,” the program is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of industry experience as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive advantage after graduation.
## Program Goals
Educational Objectives
The MS in Sustainability Engineering Leadership prepares graduates for in-demand senior technical sustainability positions in engineering and industrial firms, consultancies, and environmental organizations.
Career Outlook
According to Bloomberg, environmental, social, and governance investments and assets surpassed $30 trillion in value in 2022 and are expected to surpass $40 trillion by 2030. There has been an explosion of focus on the technological, industrial, and policy aspects of addressing sustainability challenges, including climate change. With this growth, there is demand globally for skills combining sustainability engineering and leadership.
