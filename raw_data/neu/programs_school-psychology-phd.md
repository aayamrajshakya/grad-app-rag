## Have a positive impact on the emotional health and learning of children.
Northeastern University’s Doctoral Program in School Psychology is designed to prepare students as leaders in science and practice within the field of school psychology. 
Program graduates are expected to assume leadership roles in academia and elementary and secondary schools, where they will apply their training to promote positive social change through research and practice.
The program is deeply committed and strives to increase the representation of students from historically underrepresented backgrounds. Central to our training model is an emphasis on cultural competence — understanding and addressing the influences of race, culture, and gender on children’s learning, behavior, and development. 
As an urban institution, Northeastern’s program seeks students who are motivated to make meaningful contributions in urban school settings. A commitment to social justice is central to our mission of strengthening schools’ capacity to support all students equitably. 
Although our program draws from multiple theoretical orientations that encompass the scope of school psychology, our program is grounded in social ecological and behavioral frameworks. The program’s orientation emphasizes observable relations, data-based decision making, and systematic problem solving. Coursework and supervised school-based training highlight this perspective, while also preparing students to work flexibly across diverse contexts. 
Students are trained as scientist-practitioners; they conduct original research that advances knowledge in school psychology and educational science, design and deliver evidence-based academic and behavioral interventions and engage in interprofessional collaboration. This training spans individual, group, and systems-level work, always within a behaviorally oriented, outcomes-driven model. 
Northeastern’s focus is on promoting health, resilience, and positive outcomes so that students are equipped to foster meaningful change in the communities they serve.

##  Important Information 
Collapse allExpand all
Fieldwork at a Glance 
Fieldwork training for the PhD Program in School Psychology consists of a 75-hour pre-practicum, a 200-hour practicum in a school, two years of advanced fieldwork (600 hours each year, or approximately 20 hours/week) in a school with the possible option to be in a non-school setting, and one year of an approved full-time, pre-doctoral internship, all with corresponding on-campus seminars where they receive university supervision and benefit from the experiences of their peers.
#### Pre-Practicum
As its name denotes, the pre-practicum occurs prior to the practicum. Students complete the 75-hour pre-practicum in May and June in their first year of study. The purpose of the pre-practicum is for students to gain observational experiences and to learn about school ecology. In addition to school- based observational experiences, students participate in a one-semester hour pre-practicum seminar on campus, which is taught by one of the core school psychology faculty members.
#### Practicum
Students complete 200 hours of field experience in school psychology during their second year in the program. Prior to beginning practicum, students must have a contract signed by their site and Northeastern University. Practicum begins in September and continues until the end of the public school year in June. Practicum supervision and mentoring must be provided by a state credentialed school psychologist with a minimum of three years of experience. Students should receive at least one hour of face-to-face supervision per week during their practicum.
Students should receive at least one hour of face-to-face supervision per week during their practicum. Students should complete between 3-6 assessments during their practicum year with at least two comprehensive psycho-educational assessments. The comprehensive assessments should include multiple reliable and valid methods that assess multiple domains of functioning, and the choice of instruments should be derived from the presenting concerns / referral questions.
Note: the second-year practicum experience for doctoral students involves less than half of the hours completed by students in our C.A.G.S. program in their second year. Doctoral students should not exceed the 200-hour guideline as this will have a negative impact on their research development and the demands placed on them by their challenging coursework.
Course WorkPracticum students in the PhD program will have already taken the following courses:
  * Learning Principles
  * Infant, Child & Adolescent Development
  * Seminar in School Psychology
  * Understanding Culture and Diversity
  * Behavior Management
  * Research, Data Analysis, and Evaluation
  * Cognitive Assessment
  * Clinical Skills in Counseling Psychology
  * Pre-practicum Seminar
  * Advanced Psychometric Principles
  * Biological Basis of Behavior


During the practicum year students will take the following courses, some of which have associated fieldwork (see requirements below*) that must be completed in a school-based field site:
Fall Semester
  * Social, Emotional, and Behavioral assessment
  * Counseling Children and Adolescents in School
  * Intermediate Statistics
  * Practicum Seminar


*Fall Course-Based Requirements
Spring Semester
  * Advanced Research and Data Analysis
  * Consultation and Program Evaluation
  * Counseling Children and Adolescents in School
  * Practicum Seminar


For the Social, Emotional, and Behavioral Assesment Course, students are required to complete a comprehensive assessment including (a) systematic direct observations (b) teacher, student, and parent interviews, and (c) broad and narrow band rating scales.
For the Counseling Children and Adolescents course sequence, students (a) must be able to  
counsel an individual and group for the semester and (b) write two comprehensive case  
summaries (“treatment plans”) for each (See Portfolio Guidelines for details of the requirement).
For the Consultation course, students (a) must identify a teacher who would be willing to meet  
four times and (b) implement strategies in the classroom
#### Advanced Fieldwork
Students complete 600 hours of Advanced Fieldwork (each year) during years 3 and 4 of the program. Students typically meet the requirement by completing 20 hours of fieldwork over the course of the academic year (September-June). Fieldwork sites typically offer the opportunity for several different types of psychological services including assessment, intervention, consultation, and systems-level prevention. In all cases, the first 600-hour Advanced Fieldwork placement must occur in a K-12 school. Although it is possible for the second 600-hour Advanced Fieldwork (AFW) placement to be completed in a non-school setting, students who wish to pursue this in their second year of AFW must receive approval from the program faculty prior to applying to non-school sites. Decisions regarding whether students are able to pursue AFW placements in non-school sites will be made based on the breadth and depth of the student’s prior school-based experiences.
#### Field Supervision:
Field supervisors in school sites must have a Massachusetts educator’s license (certification) as a school psychologist and a minimum of three years of experience as a school psychologist. Practicum and Advanced Fieldwork supervision consists of a minimum of one hour per week, in a face-to-face format. In non-school sites, supervisors must be licensed health providers in the state of Massachusetts and a minimum of three years experience as a psychologist.
#### University Supervision:
Students are enrolled in a seminar course, instructed by a certified school psychologist during the practicum year and a licensed psychologist during the Advanced Fieldwork years. The university supervisor maintains contact with the field supervisor through two site visits and phone calls when necessary. At the end of the year, the field and university supervisors determine if the student has progressed adequately in core areas and is ready for the subsequent fieldwork experience.
Pre-Doctoral Internships 
The following list includes examples of where current and former students have done their pre-doctoral internship.
  * AHRC New York City, NY
  * Center for Effective Child Therapy at Judge Baker Children’s Center, Boston, MA
  * Devereux, Villanova, PA
  * Franciscan Hospital for Children, Boston, MA
  * Hawaii Psychology Internship Consortium (Kauai School District), Kauai, HI
  * Mailman Center for Child Development
  * May Institute, Randolph, MA
  * Milton Hershey School, Hershey, PA
  * Newton Public Schools, Newton MA
  * Primary Children’s Hospital, Salt Lake City, UT
  * University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM
  * Washburn Center for Children, Minneapolis, MN


Optional Concentration in Applied Behavior Analysis 
Northeastern University’s School Psychology MS/CAGS and PhD Programs offer an optional concentration in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) that provides students with the opportunity to apply to sit for the BCBA exam upon completion of the concentration. This optional sequence includes additional coursework from Northeastern University’s Certificate Program in ABA under the direction of Dr. Nicole Davis. Three of the courses are already part of the regular school psychology curriculum (CAEP 6206 Learning Principles, CAEP 6328 Single Case Design, and CAEP 6347 Behavior Management).
Students take four additional online courses that are part of Northeastern University’s Certificate Program in ABA (CAEP 6326 Behavioral Concepts and Principles, CAEP 6327 Behavior Assessment, CAEP 6329 Service Administration, CAEP 6336 Systematic Inquiry in Applied Research). In addition, students have the opportunity to gain supervised experience hours by taking CAEP 8417 Intensive Practicum in ABA I and CAEP 8418 Intensive Practicum in ABA II. These two courses fulfill 50% of the required supervised experience hours. The ABA courses are independently offered by the School Psychology PhD Program and are not required for the program. 
None of the online courses are permitted to substitute for courses in the required PhD curriculum. If students are interested in pursuing the ABA concentration, they should inform the ABA and School Psychology program directors of their interest at the start of the program because this choice will have implications for their coursework and fieldwork in year 1 of the program.

## Frequently
### What makes Northeastern’s school psychology programs special?
Both the MS/CAGS and PhD programs are distinct for a number of reasons, including strong faculty mentoring relationships with students, a supportive learning community, a rigorous curriculum with excellent applied training in both research and practice, an ecological and multicultural approach to learning with a focus on family, school and community systems, culture, and diversity, a strong network of practice sites for field placements in urban schools and academic medical centers, and opportunities to develop leadership skills.

### Does my undergraduate major need to be psychology to apply to the program?
No. Although most applicants to the program were psychology majors in college, some are not. Our program does require the following four undergraduate psychology courses as prerequisites:  
(1) Introduction to Psychology   
(2) Research Methods and Statistics (in psychology or in another social science field)  
(3) Developmental Psychology  
(4) Abnormal Psychology.

### What is a CAGS degree?
CAGS stands for Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study and is the equivalent to an Educational Specialist (EdS) or 6th year degree. Our program prepares students for National Certification in School Psychology (NCSP) and Massachusetts licensure in school psychology.
