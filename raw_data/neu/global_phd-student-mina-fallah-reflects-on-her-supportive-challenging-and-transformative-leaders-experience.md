**Enryka Chr** istopher (EC): What is your major and research focus? 
Mina Fallah (MF): I am pursuing a PhD in Personal Health Informatics. My research focuses on simulating face-to-face counseling, primarily in health education and behavior change interventions. We design and develop conversational agents to improve health education and support individuals managing chronic conditions.
EC: What drew you to the LEADERs Course?
MF: I was drawn to the LEADERs Course because it focuses on developing essential soft skills like problem-solving, communication, and leadership—skills that are crucial for both academic and industry careers. I wanted to enhance my ability to collaborate across disciplines and effectively communicate my research to different audiences.
EC: What is one valuable thing you took away from the course? 
MF: One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the importance of teamwork, clear communication, and knowing when to ask for help. The course reinforced that successful collaboration comes from leveraging different perspectives and being open to feedback and support.
EC: How did the LEADERs Course support or change your perspective on your research? 
MF: The LEADERs course helped me see my research from a broader perspective, especially how it can be applied beyond academia. I also learned how to align my work with industry needs and collaborate more effectively with professionals from different fields.
EC: What was your experience like in the LEADERs Course? 
MF: I gained experience in problem-solving, adaptability, time management, and critical thinking. The program challenged me to step outside my comfort zone, build confidence, and learn how to collaborate effectively across different disciplines. Overall, it was a rewarding and eye-opening experience. I gained a better understanding of self-awareness, leadership styles, and how to work effectively with others. The course helped me improve my communication skills, build confidence in decision-making, and recognize the importance of adaptability and emotional intelligence in leadership.
**EC:** What advice would you give to a PhD student considering the LEADERs Course? 
MF: I would advise them to join if they want to learn and practice important skills like communication, leadership, and problem-solving. The program offers a chance to develop these skills in a supportive environment, which is valuable for both academic and professional growth. It’s a great way to strengthen areas that will help you succeed in your future career.
**EC:** What are some words of advice for PhD students coming to Boston to attend Northeastern from across the world? 
MF: Boston is a fantastic city for research and networking, but it can be overwhelming at first. Find a good support system, explore the city’s academic and professional resources, and don’t hesitate to reach out to faculty and peers. Also, prepare for the weather—layers are your best friend!
