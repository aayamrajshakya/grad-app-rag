### Drugs and Society
#### SOCL 1295
Focuses on historical and contemporary drug issues through the lens of classic sociological concerns. Rather than looking at only the legal/illegal discourse or historical/contemporary production, distribution, and use of drugs, the course frames drug topics around issues of class, race and ethnicity, age, and gender, asking the question of which drugs are used by whom and why at certain life stages. Specific topics include the high incarceration rates for nonviolent drug offenders; the role of drugs in death and dying via death penalty drugs and/or hospice care; mental health and drug treatment; and the potential perfidy of global drug testing and management.
