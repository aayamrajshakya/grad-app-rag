# Native Space
## People in this story

**Partially supported by a NULab Community Collaboration Grant.**
“Native Space” is a digital platform for sharing artful, place-based audio narratives of Indigenous survival, resistance, and resurgence in Eastern Massachusetts. Using co-creation methods, the project will ultimately encompass three parts: an iOS app, a website, and a series of separate, in-person conversations for members of Eastern Massachusetts Indigenous communities and the non-Native public. The pilot iteration of the project is a collaboration with the Massachusett Tribe at Ponkapoag and the City of Salem to develop content responding to the historic deed that legitimized, under colonial law, the transfer of the Massachusett village of Naumkeag to the settlers of Salem. This material will be experienced by audiences via a location-aware web app built on the open-source Roundware platform.
