# Women Writers Project
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
The [Women Writers Project](http://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/) is a long-term research project devoted to early modern women’s writing and electronic text encoding. The project has been working since 1988 on building an electronic collection of rare and less familiar texts, and on researching the complex issues involved in representing early printed texts in digital form. The WWP’s goal is to bring texts by pre-Victorian women writers out of the archive and make them accessible to a wide audience of teachers, students, scholars, and the general reader. The WWP also works to support research on women’s writing, text encoding, and the role of electronic texts in teaching and scholarship.
The WWP’s flagship publication is [Women Writers Online](http://wwp.neu.edu/wwo/), a [TEI](http://tei-c.org/)-encoded collection of more than 470 texts written or translated by women and first published in print between 1526 and 1850. The project is also partnering with the [Almanacks of Mary Moody Emerson: A Scholarly Digital Edition](https://marymoodyemerson.net/) to prototype encoding and publication practices for manuscript texts—and Women Writers Online currently includes around over twenty “Folders” from Emerson’s handwritten Almanacks. [Women Writers in Context](http://wwp.neu.edu/context), an open-access experimental publication series collecting scholarly essays and explorations of women’s writing. More recently, the project has published [Women Writers in Review](http://wwp.neu.edu/review), an open-access collection of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century reviews, publication notices, literary histories, and other texts responding to works by early women writers.
