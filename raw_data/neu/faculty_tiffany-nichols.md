#  TiffanyNichols
Assistant Professor of History and Civil and Environmental Engineering; Legacy Survey of Space and Time Discovery Alliance Catalyst Faculty Fellow 
College of Engineering 
Tiffany Nichols is a historian of science, technology, and the environment. Her current book manuscript focuses on the siting history of large-scale instruments and science facilities, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), and how surrounding natural and built environments become embedded within the outputs of these instruments. Specifically, she explores how physicists distinguish gravitational wave signal from noise generated by the instrument and its surrounding environment. Broadly, she is interested in research topics at the intersection of history, science, technology, environment, and law. Nichols holds a joint appointment between the Department of History in the College of Social Sciences and Humanities and the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the College of Engineering. She is currently a Legacy Survey of Space and Time Discovery Alliance Catalyst Faculty Fellow. Dr. Nichols was recently featured on PBS’s Nova, which you can watch [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dt06aTX9jM34&ved=2ahUKEwjcprC0nc2JAxXOKVkFHUqxD5oQtwJ6BAgNEAI&usg=AOvVaw3xFHSibQ7sJQ9UPWBtVUFR)
