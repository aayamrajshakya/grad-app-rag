## College of Professional Studies Grants
### Federal Pell Grant
Federal Pell Grants are only awarded to undergraduate students who have not yet earned a bachelor’s or professional degree. As a program targeted to high need students, your eligibility will also depend upon your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Your EFC is calculated utilizing a formula established by Congress when your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is processed. Eligibility for Pell Grant funds is determined by your EFC and enrollment status (fulltime, 3/4 time, 1/2 time, less than 1/2 time). These grants of up to $5,920 for the academic year (the maximum award for 2017-2018) are awarded to undergraduate students.
### MASS State Grant
The Massachusetts State Grant, or [MASSGrant](http://www.mass.edu/osfa/programs/massgrant.asp), is a grant assistance program funded by appropriations from the Massachusetts Legislature. The MASSGrant program provides need-based financial assistance to undergraduate students who reside in Massachusetts and who are enrolled in and pursuing a first bachelor degree in a program of higher education in any approved public or independent college, university, school of nursing or any other approved institution furnishing a program of higher education. Parents of dependent students must also reside in Massachusetts.
In addition to its full-time grant award, the state of Massachusetts also offers a part-time grant to students who are enrolled on a less than full-time basis. [Learn more](http://www.mass.edu/osfa/home/home.asp) about the Massachusetts Part-Time Grant.
### Other State Grants
Many other states aside from Massachusetts offer support to students who meet specific qualifications. The states of Pennsylvania and Vermont allow their residents to transfer scholarship support to Massachusetts schools. If we have added a state grant to your award, it reflects our best estimate of your eligibility; however, the amount is subject to change, based on state guidelines and funding levels. You will be notified directly by the state whether you qualify, and if so, the dollar amount of your award. It is important that you check with your state scholarship office about qualification requirements and application deadline dates.
