2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business [Full-Time MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=ftmba) program is designed to prepare students to lead with impact. Our Full-Time MBA program integrates business knowledge with a deep understanding of technology, preparing students to stay ahead of change and become the leaders that today’s business world demands. Students will choose from a wide-ranging list of in-demand electives and concentrations—including our signature MBA x concentrations—allowing them to develop a unique nonbusiness skill set.
## Integrate Classroom and Professional Experiences
Learning by doing is a hallmark of a Northeastern MBA. Students apply their knowledge to actual business challenges through experience-fueled electives and class projects. Through a corporate residency, students translate ideas to action for 3, 6, or up to 12 months. Far removed from the typical internship, students work full time at a leading firm or startup in their field and have significant responsibilities as they work to deliver on organizational goals. 
## Select Two Concentrations
Students will specialize their degree by selecting two in-demand business concentrations. Or, they could choose to add expertise in another professional area by choosing an interdisciplinary MBA x concentration in a highly relevant field offered through partnerships with other Northeastern colleges.
## Build an Interdisciplinary Skill Set
Students will select 6 interdisciplinary (nonbusiness) semester hours of their choice. They can mix and match the content that interests them from a diverse list of eligible graduate courses across Northeastern colleges.
