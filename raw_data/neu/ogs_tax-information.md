##  Understanding taxes 
  * If you receive U.S. source income, including wages, stipend, or scholarship, you will likely have federal and state tax withheld from your checks.
  * U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings. When you file your annual tax report in April of each year, you will calculate the exact amount of tax due. (Some years you may get a refund and in others you may owe additional taxes.)


Who must file tax forms for 2025 tax season?
Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the U.S. in F or J status anytime between January 1st – December 31st 2024, you’re obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or ‘IRS’, are the U.S. tax authorities).
Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable U.S. source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances, you may also need to file a state tax return(s).
Tax Filing Deadline:
April 15, 2025
Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes:
Generally, most international students & scholars who are on F, J, M Q visas nonresidents for tax purposes. 
If you’ve been in the U.S. for longer than the five or two year periods, the **Substantial Presence Test** will determine your tax residency.

W-2 | This form reports your wage earnings if you worked.If you had more than one employer you should get a W-2 from each employer. It is issued by the end of January for the previous year. Make sure all employers from last year have an up-to-date address for you.  
1042-S | This form is used to report:1. Stipend, scholarship, fellowship income and travel grants (not tuition reduction or exemption) 2. Income covered by a tax treaty 3. Payment for other types of services (eg by the semester as a note-taker) If you received this type of income, the 1042-S will be e mailed to you by 15 March by the payer. **Note: Only Nonresident Aliens receive this form. If your tax status changes to a Resident Alien you will not get a 1042-S. Login to Sprintax to check your tax status if you’re not sure.**  
U.S. entry and exit dates for current and past visits to the U.S. | In addition to passport stamps, you can review or print your U.S. travel history here  
1099 | This form reports miscellaneous income. Can be interest on bank accounts, stocks, bonds, dividends, earning through freelance employment  
1098-T | This form is NOT needed and can NOT be used for a nonresident tax return because NRAs are not eligible to claim education expense tax credits.  
### 2) Follow the Sprintax instructions
If you did not earn any U.S. Income: Sprintax will generate a completed Form 8843 for you and each of your dependents (if you have any).
If you did earn U.S. Income: Sprintax will generate your “tax return documents”, including form 1040NR, depending on your circumstances.
### 3) If required, complete your state tax return
After you finish your federal return, Sprintax will inform you if you need to complete a state tax return. If so, you will have the option to use Sprintax for an additional fee. However, it is your choice to use them or to do the state tax return on your own.
### 4) Read the instructions for filing/mailing your returns
Remember to read the instructions that Sprintax provides.
You will be required to download, print and sign your federal tax return and mail it to the IRS. Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to E-file your Federal tax return. However, this will depend on certain eligibility criteria. You can learn more about eligibility in this Sprintax blog – <https://blog.sprintax.com/nonresident-federal-tax-efiling-live/>
If you have a state filing requirement, you must also mail this to the tax authorities.
Finally, if you only need to file Form 8843, this will also need to be mailed to the IRS.
