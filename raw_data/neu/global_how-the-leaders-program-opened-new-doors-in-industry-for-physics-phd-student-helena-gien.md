For Dr. Helena Gien, a Physics PhD graduate working with optical tweezers to manipulate individual DNA molecules, the path from academia to industry seemed unclear. Her highly specialized research—using lasers to study single molecules in what she describes as “super niche academic settings”—had little obvious overlap with industry applications. 
“My professional network was basically just my Principal Investigator,” Gien recalled, “When it came time to look for jobs, people ahead of me were graduating and saying, ‘It’s a really tough job market, you should do everything you can to use the resources at the school to network with people before you start looking for jobs.'” That advice to improve job hunting prospects initially motivated Gien to do the LEADERs program, but she ultimately gained much more than she first anticipated.
**Finding a Fit at Amgen**
The matching process proved challenging at first. Gien’s optical tweezers expertise was so specialized that Terry Marroquin, Director of LEADERs Partnership Programs, struggled to find a suitable industry partner. A breakthrough came during a Husky Trek to Amgen, where Gien submitted her resume and landed an interview with the biopharmaceutical giant’s mass spectrometry group.
“I had no experience in mass spec, but it was sort of the same flavor of physics mixed with solving biological questions,” Gien explained. Despite the steep learning curve, she dove into characterizing monoclonal antibodies—a critical process for drug development. Her project involved helping Amgen validate a new, more efficient cell line for producing therapeutic molecules. To bring the improved process to market without additional FDA approval, the company needed to prove the new cells produced identical molecules to their existing process; Mass spectrometry provided that proof. “I felt like I couldn’t bring that much value on the mass spec side because I was so new to it,” Gien acknowledged, “But what I could bring was the computational side of things. I ended up doing a project in R, and that became my main contribution.”
The experience revealed an unexpected competitive advantage. While Gien had assumed her physics background might not translate to industry, she discovered that many professionals with biology, biochemistry, and chemistry backgrounds lacked computational skills. “It turns out that a lot of folks with backgrounds in biology and chemistry didn’t get a computational background as part of their PhDs,” she reflected, “So it was something I could offer, and that hadn’t occurred to me before.” This realization transformed Gien’s job search strategy. “I wasn’t just going into applying for jobs blindly anymore, thinking ‘I could probably do this, I could probably do that.’ I had a more finely tuned idea of where I could bring value.” 
Beyond technical skills, Gien gained something equally valuable: professional relationships. She developed a strong connection with her manager, which led to her becoming a co-author on an upcoming publication from her work with them. “We have each other’s contact info, and they said, ‘stay in contact—this doesn’t have to be the end,'” Gien noted, “I achieved my goal of expanding my network. I’m not going to Amgen right now for a job—I got a different full-time role—but just to have that door open is amazing.”
Once back in her final year of PhD studies, Gien found ways to apply her Amgen experience to her academic work. When a fellow lab mate was struggling, she suggested using a specific sample separation technique learned during her placement with Amgen, called “size exclusion columns,” which solved her lab mate’s issue. “It’s good to send people out to get a diversity of experience, because in a single lab, everyone does things all the same way,” she observed, “There’s no real outside voice, especially if it’s everybody’s first time doing serious science from a PhD perspective.”
**The LEADERs Experience**
Gien’s enthusiasm for the program extended well beyond her industry placement: “It was so much better than I thought it would be. It was the most support I’ve received throughout my entire PhD.” The program provided one-on-one career support, mentor matching, and engaging coursework that Gien found surprisingly valuable. “I didn’t think I would like a leadership or project management-based class, but it was fun and lighthearted, and I took a lot from it.” The sense of community that formed particularly resonated with her. “It’s a great thing to build a sense of community with people who want to lift you up and want to see you succeed in your career outside of academia.”
Gien’s recommendation to PhD students considering the LEADERs program was unequivocal: “Do it, do it, do it. You have nothing to lose.” She emphasized the minimal time commitment relative to the substantial benefits. “The classes are just a couple of hours out of the week, and a semester away from your research really isn’t going to make or break your PhD timeline. I think it’s the most valuable thing you could do, whether you want to stay in academia or not.”
While Gien ultimately chose a position on the physics and engineering side rather than joining a large biopharmaceutical company, her LEADERs experience provided clarity about her career direction and opened doors she never knew existed. “Working at Amgen really solidified in my mind that my niche would be in the computational side. If I was going to work at a place like that, I figured out exactly where I could bring value.” For PhD students navigating the transition from academic research to industry careers, Gien’s story illustrates how sometimes the most valuable discoveries happen outside the lab—in boardrooms, through professional networks, and within programs designed to bridge the gap between academic training and industry needs. 
_Upon completion of the “Leading Self and Others” course, LEADERs program staff and partner companies select fellows who align with specific industry needs. PhDs are supported through the fellowship application process and placed in a specialized role to solve a problem in industry. They go on to earn a LEADERs’ Experiential PhD leadership certificate, with guidance from an industry mentor and faculty advisor. The program is run by the PhD Network, which helps prepare students to enter the workforce as impactful researchers._
