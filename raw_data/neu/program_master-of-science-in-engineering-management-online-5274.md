## Skip the application—let your performance pave your way
With the MSEM program’s [Fast App pathway](https://online.northeastern.edu/degrees/fast-app/), you can skip the application process and use your performance on two initial courses to secure your place in the MSEM program.
Complete two performance-based courses from the MSEM program, get a ‘B’ or better, show proof of your bachelor's degree from an eligible institution by the time you complete the two courses, and you’ll join the next cohort in the master’s degree. All credits earned in the MSEM performance-based courses apply directly to the MSEM degree program.

##### EMGT 6225: Economic Decision Making
Explores economic modeling and analysis techniques for selecting alternatives from potential solutions to an engineering problem. Considers measures of merit, such as present worth, annual worth, rate of return, and benefit/cost techniques. Examines recent techniques of economic analysis, especially the tools of decision making. Explores decisions under uncertainty. Studies the causes of risk and uncertainty, and examines ways to change and influence the degree of risk and uncertainty through sensitivity analysis, expectation-variance criterion, decision tree analysis, statistical decision techniques, and multiple attribute decision making through group case studies.
##### OR 6205: Deterministic Operations Research 
Introduces the theory, computation, and application of deterministic models to represent industrial operations. Includes linear programming formulation and solution using spreadsheet and algebraic languages software; simplex, big-M, two-phase, revised simplex, and dual simplex algorithms for solving linear programs; introduction to the theory of simplex, fundamental insight, duality, and sensitivity analysis; transportation, assignment, and transshipment problems; shortest path, minimum spanning tree, maximum flow, minimum cost network flow problems and project networks; and discrete-state and continuous-state dynamic programming models and applications. Requires knowledge of linear algebra.
