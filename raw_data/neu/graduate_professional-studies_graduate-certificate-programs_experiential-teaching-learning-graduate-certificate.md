2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Experiential learning has been documented to be an effective pedagogy for promoting deeper learning, fostering student engagement, and ultimately closing the opportunity gap for underserved students. However, many educators and educational leaders are not familiar with best-practice strategies for leading, practicing, and researching experiential learning in their classrooms and therefore need themselves to become adult learners to begin the process of pedagogical transformation.
The Graduate Certificate in Experiential Teaching and Learning is designed to provide K–12 experiential educators with the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to design, facilitate, research, and lead engaging and meaningful learning experiences. The program explores the theoretical foundations, approaches, and strategies for learning through experience and how to apply these competencies with a commitment toward fostering educational equity.
Classroom teachers who are interested in transforming their practice as well as educators who are interested in seeking out leadership roles within schools will benefit from earning the Graduate Certificate in Experiential Teaching and Learning as the certificate covers content and skills needed for leading both student and adult experiential learning.
The certificate is comprised of 16 quarter hours, which may be applied toward the Master of Education in Learning and Instruction.
