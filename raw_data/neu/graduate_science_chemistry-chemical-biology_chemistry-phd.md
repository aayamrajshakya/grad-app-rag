2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The PhD program in chemistry is designed for students who have earned a bachelor’s or a master’s degree in chemistry or related areas and who wish to earn a doctorate in chemistry. Research spans a wide range of multidisciplinary fields, with strengths in clean energy, polymers, materials, medicinal chemistry, bioanalytical chemistry, and chemical biology. Our research programs draw from a strong foundation in analytical, organic, physical, and biological chemistry in a collaborative and diverse environment. Our student-focused approach to mentoring, a strong graduate student association, and faculty deeply rooted both in academics and industry provide a flexible platform for student development toward a large diversity of career paths.
Students typically take courses their first year while supported on teaching assistantships and achieve PhD candidacy in the second year. The primary emphasis of the program is on the completion of an original research project, its articulation in a well-written thesis, and its subsequent defense before the thesis committee through an open seminar followed by oral examination by the committee members.

Advanced entry into the PhD program requires a master’s degree in chemistry or a related area. Graduate courses taken during acquisition of the Master of Science degree allow completion of the PhD program with fewer course credits. Other than the course requirements, which are specified separately, see the PhD program requirements for details.
### Industry Entry PhD
This program is strictly for students who already have a master’s degree in chemistry or related area and have full-time employment at a company. The company must commit to all financial responsibilities accrued in obtaining the degree and allow time for the student to work on a PhD thesis in collaborative research with a company supervisor and one of our faculty members. Graduate courses in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology are generally taught in the evenings to accommodate the fact that our students work in industry during the day.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
