#  EunsongKim
Associate Professor of English 
Professor Kim’s work centers critiques of colonialisms and racial capitalism and draws from critical digital studies, translation studies, critical theory and critical race & ethnic studies. She teaches courses on Race & Artificial Intelligence, Technology & Colonialism, Neoliberal Aesthetics, Asian American Literature, Critical Art and Culture Writing, Self-Portraiture and Photography, as well as Contemporary Poetry, and Poetry Workshop. She is the author of gospel of regicide (2017), and, with Sung Gi Kim, she translated Kim Eon Hee’s Have You Been Feeling Blue These Days? (2019). Kim’s writings have appeared in the anthologies American Poets in the 21st Century: Poetics of Social Engagement (Wesleyan University Press, 2018), edited by Claudia Rankine and Michael Dowdy, and Reading Modernism with Machines: Digital Humanities and Modern Literature (Springer, 2016), edited by Shawna Ross and James O’Sullivan. Her forthcoming academic monograph, The Politics of Collecting: Race & the Aestheticization of Property (Duke University Press 2024) materializes the histories of immaterialism by examining the rise of US museums, avant-garde forms, digitization, and neoliberal aesthetics, to consider how race and property become foundational to modern artistic institutions. Kim is the recipient of a Ford Foundation Fellowship, a grant from the Andy Warhol Arts Writers Program, and Yale University’s Poynter Fellowship. In 2021 she cofounded [offshootjournal.org](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Foffshootjournal.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cj.bagley%40northeastern.edu%7C6cb29549f88549dfec3d08db8c1338de%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638257786417597999%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=UnDq2AGesy8I5fhx%2F7Db8UQ7Io9afIpOtZCy8Oc7w64%3D&reserved=0 "https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Foffshootjournal.org%2F&data=05%7C01%7Cj.bagley%40northeastern.edu%7C6cb29549f88549dfec3d08db8c1338de%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638257786417597999%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=UnDq2AGesy8I5fhx%2F7Db8UQ7Io9afIpOtZCy8Oc7w64%3D&reserved=0"), an arts space for transnational activist conversations.
