#  Changes to Visa Interview Waiver Policy for F/J Visa Renewal Applicants 
August 26, 2025 
**Effective September 2, 2025, the**[**U.S. Department of State**](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/interview-waiver-update-july-25-2025.html)**will require that all F-1 and J-1 students and scholars, including their F-2 or J-2 dependents, attend in-person interviews at U.S. Embassies or Consulates abroad when applying to renew their visas.**
This change marks an end to broader flexibility for interview waivers that were provided to international students, scholars, and their dependents during the COVID-19 pandemic. This updated policy may increase wait times for visa renewal processing. Students, scholars, and their dependents should plan accordingly when applying for visa renewals outside the U.S.
**As a reminder****, F-1/J-1 non-immigrant students and scholars and their F-2/J-2 dependents may remain in the U.S. after their F or J visa has expired, as long as their I-20/DS-2019 remains valid and they continue to maintain their nonimmigrant status**. OGS advises that students and scholars **do not travel solely for the purpose of visa renewal****,** as delays in returning to the U.S. can impact your ability to maintain your F/J non-immigrant status, which requires on-ground, full-time enrollment for students, and in-person engagement in your research or teaching as a scholar.
