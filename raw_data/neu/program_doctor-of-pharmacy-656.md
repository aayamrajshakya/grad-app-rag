Accreditations 
[The Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/pharmacy/programs/pharmd/) program at Northeastern University School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences is fully accredited by the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education. [The Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education](http://www.acpe-accredit.org/) is the national agency for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy and providers of continuing pharmacy education. ACPE (until 2003 known as the American Council on Pharmaceutical Education) was established in 1932 for the accreditation of professional degree programs in pharmacy, and in 1975 its scope was broadened to include accreditation of providers of continuing pharmacy education. The mission of ACPE is to assure and advance quality in pharmacy education. ACPE is an autonomous and independent agency whose board of directors is appointed by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, the American Pharmacists Association, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (three appointments each), and the American Council on Education (one appointment). Since the inception of its accreditation agency recognition program in 1952, ACPE has been recognized continuously by the U.S. Department of Education, and it gained recognition by the Council for Higher Education Accreditation in April 2004. State boards of pharmacy require that licensure applicants from the United States have graduated from an accredited pharmacy degree program to be eligible to sit for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEXÂ®).
Unique features 
  * Northeastern has the only PharmD co-op program in the country.
  * The pharmacy curriculum includes introductory (cooperative education) and advanced pharmacy practice experiences, which are provided primarily under the direct supervision of qualified pharmacist preceptors.
  * Graduates will be eligible to sit for the North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination TM (NAPLEXÂ®).


Career outcomes 
Graduates work primarily in community pharmacies or in healthcare facilities but also work in health maintenance organizations, private practice groups, long-term care facilities, home healthcare, the Public Health Service, the armed services, law enforcement agencies, drug development, marketing, research, colleges of pharmacy, and professional association management. In addition, many of our graduates go on to pharmacy practice residencies, fellowships, and leading graduate programs.
Experience-based learning 
The proximity to Boston’s world-renowned healthcare institutions provides the backdrop for a cooperative/experiential education program that is second to none. Our affiliations with such institutions provide our students with a variety of exceptional introductory (IPPE) and advanced (APPE) pharmacy practice experiences. At the heart of the Northeastern model is the cooperative education program, the only program of its kind among U.S. pharmacy schools. Co-ops are four-month experiences that fulfill the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experience, which is required in all pharmacy schools.
