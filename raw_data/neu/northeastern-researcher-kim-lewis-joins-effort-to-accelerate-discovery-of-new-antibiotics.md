Northeastern researcher [Kim Lewis](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/kim-lewis/) is spearheading an effort to accelerate discovery of new antibiotics as part of a multi-institutional, federally funded project to tackle the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
“It’s a big issue because we largely stopped introducing novel antibiotics about 50 years ago,” says Lewis, distinguished professor of biology and director of Northeastern’s [Antimicrobial Discovery Center](https://lewislab.sites.northeastern.edu/).
“Bacteria continue to acquire and spread resistance, which has led to the antimicrobial resistance crisis the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance) calls a slow-moving pandemic” that contributes to nearly 5 million deaths a year, Lewis says.
The goal of the accelerated technology is to use a high throughput approach and microfluidics to hasten the discovery of novel antibiotics.
Lewis’ research is part of a $104 million federal contract led by[ Johan Paulsson of Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/hms-researcher-lead-104-million-federal-project-tackling-antibiotic-resistance). The contract is funded through the newly established [Advanced Research Projects for Health (ARPA-H)](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__arpa-2Dh.gov_research-2Dand-2Dfunding_open-2Dbaa_awardees&d=DwMF-g&c=WO-RGvefibhHBZq3fL85hQ&r=hGT-21mUdMlfMPbsiJ8GUdAkuooe2b8frL53gyZsEdQ&m=38MOkY3Bd7yY6Btizd_9UREHismyyfbc6ZxDiAaIHwTW3mh4muULrMrJxiQMEdpl&s=7BTbs2CT8h3mhNSTgMCK6JHuM-jOg0-ygoNDuNgB0ZQ&e=).
