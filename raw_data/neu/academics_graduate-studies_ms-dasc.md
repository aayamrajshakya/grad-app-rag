## Overview
Data has become one of the most critical tools in shaping our economy, society, and culture. Now more than ever, the world needs people who can understand this untapped resource and draw conclusions so vital to future success. The Master of Science (MS) in Data Science was developed with that in mind. As an interdisciplinary program between the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Engineering, you’ll develop comprehensive expertise in mathematics, computing, and data engineering so you can take your data career to the next level. That interdisciplinary aspect means you’ll receive robust, comprehensive exposure to the world of data science. Our elective courses will help you create a curriculum that’s unique to your own interests.

## Innovative Curriculum
Unique Features
An interdisciplinary program between Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the College of Engineering.
Choose between two concentrations: computer science (Khoury College of Computer Sciences) and engineering theory and modeling (College of Engineering).
Courses are tailored toward technically or mathematically trained students.
Elective courses allow you to explore what interests you.
Toggle Accordion  Graduate Certificates 
Over 15 [graduate certificates](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=Graduate%20Certificate) are available to provide students the opportunity to develop a specialization in an area of their choice. Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
Toggle Accordion  Location 
The engineering theory and modeling concentration is offered in Boston. The [computer science concentration](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/programs/data-science-ms/) is also offered at other campuses.
Toggle Accordion  Align Program for Non-Technical Backgrounds 
Students do not need a background in data science to have a future in it. A master’s designed for non-majors, the [Align program](https://nustggrad2024.wpenginepowered.com/programs/ms-data-science-align/master-of-science-in-data-science-align-boston/) can help you launch your new data career between two and three years.

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. Northeastern is an R1 research institution, rated among universities with the highest research activity.
The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 2,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepare students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
## Program Goals
##### Education Objectives
Learn In-Demand Skills and Knowledge
Gain the ability to effectively utilize integrated databases for managing large-scale datasets, effectively apply an appropriate machine-learning model to a problem, and then communicate those insights.
Our program allows you to develop strong programming and analysis skills to explore data, produce summary statistics, perform statistical analyses; using standard data mining and machine-learning models for effective analysis.
Master Data Management
You’ll learn to work with both structure and unstructured data. The program provides you with the knowledge to manage, process, analyze, and visualize data at scale.
##### Career Outlook
After you successfully complete your master’s in data science are qualified to seek jobs as:
  * Data scientist
  * Machine learning engineer
  * Applications architect
  * Enterprise architect
  * Data architect
  * Infrastructure architect
  * Data engineer
  * Business intelligence developer
  * Data analyst


Employees with data science expertise are sought out in every industry, not just in technology. “Data scientists are highly educated—88% have at least a master’s degree and 46% have PhDs—and while there are notable exceptions, a very strong educational background is usually required to develop the depth of knowledge necessary to be a data scientist,” reports KDnuggets, a leading website on Big Data.
