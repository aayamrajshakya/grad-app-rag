You'll use Bloomberg Terminal to prepare stock pitches and write original research reports.

> As a first-time student joining the fund, you may come in knowing very little about the stock market. By the end of one meeting, you'll know how to write an original research report on a stock and get sound ideas about how to analyze its finances. It's a huge, huge learning experience that has only the pressure or responsibility of a one-credit class.
