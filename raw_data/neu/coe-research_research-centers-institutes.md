## COE Researchers Are Active in Northeastern Research Institutes
  * [ Institute of Information Assurance ](https://iia.ccs.neu.edu/)
Protecting the integrity and security of information and reducing the vulnerability of hardware and software systems to attacks.
  * [ Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute ](https://cyber.northeastern.edu/)
Forging partnerships with experts in industry, government, and academia worldwide, the Institute’s faculty and students develop, protect, and enhance technologies on which the world relies—from mobile devices and “smart” IoT applications to tomorrow’s self-driving cars and delivery drones.
  * [ Institute for Experiential AI ](https://ai.northeastern.edu/)
The true promise of AI lies at the intersection of humans and intelligent machines, helping each achieve what neither could alone and to transform society for the better. Northeastern’s Institute for Experiential AI advances this human-centered approach, enabling us to design, implement, and scale AI to help people reach greater productivity and creativity at work, lead healthier lives, and build stronger communities.
  * [ Quantum Materials and Sensing Institute ](https://quantum.northeastern.edu/)
Developing the next-generation of quantum materials and sensing technology for impactful real-world applications.
