## Dive deep into the software life cycle 
As tech-driven innovation continues to disrupt traditional business models, successful organizations must adapt to market changes—with software playing a critical role. Businesses need professionals who understand software development processes, tools, and organizational structures and can quickly capitalize on opportunities. 
In our MBA x Software Development concentration—offered through a partnership with [Northeastern's Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/)—you'll gain exposure to the latest technologies and build skills in the field. With guidance from Khoury's award-winning professors, you'll create web and mobile apps while learning software engineering foundations like requirements analysis, user-centered design, software design principles and patterns, and software architecture. 
If you have a degree in computer science, you can jump right into the MBA x Software Development coursework. If your degree is in another field, you'll start with 16 credits of bridge courses taught by Khoury faculty to prepare you for this advanced computer science coursework.
