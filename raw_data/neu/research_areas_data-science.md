# Data Science at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Understanding how we collect, organize, and make sense of data to create knowledge and support human decision-making
Big data is all around us. Extremely large and complex datasets have become a backbone of our digital life — underpinning transportation and navigation systems, detecting financial fraud, and advancing scientific research in biology, among many other spheres.
Data science is the interdisciplinary study of all aspects of data: collecting it, managing it, storing and retrieving it, analyzing it, and building systems that can mine valuable patterns and knowledge, leading to applications that help run our world. Khoury College researchers are breaking new ground in both theory and systems in data science. Together, these areas ensure that data can be efficiently managed and utilized, supporting advancements in artificial intelligence, industry, scientific research, health care, and the humanities.

## Changing how we think of data
Data science’s impact on society is all around us, and its role is increasing exponentially. It has revolutionized decision-making in health care and drug discovery. Businesses depend on data science to optimize operations, manage supply chains and keep transactions secure. Scientific research has also benefited from data science, enabling faster discoveries and deeper understanding in fields like genomics, astronomy, and environmental science.
Data science research has also changed how we think of data: It is now a valuable asset in its own right, with possibilities that go beyond any one purpose or application. The ability to collect, analyze, and interpret vast amounts of information has opened new avenues for innovation and problem-solving generally, crossing disciplines and bridging boundaries.

## Recent research publications
**[A Unified Approach for Resilience and Causal Responsibility with Integer Linear Programming (ILP) and LP Relaxations](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3626715)**  
Authors:
This research introduces a new method using Integer Linear Programming to solve the problem of finding the smallest set of data to remove from a database to eliminate specific query results. This method can be applied to a broader range of database queries than previous method — and in some cases, it works faster.
**[On the Reasonable Effectiveness of Relational Diagrams: Explaining Relational Query Patterns and the Pattern Expressiveness of Relational Languages](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3639316)**  
Authors:
This research introduces a new way to define and compare query patterns across different programming languages, leading to the development of Relational Diagrams, a visual tool that helps users understand and write database queries faster and more accurately.
