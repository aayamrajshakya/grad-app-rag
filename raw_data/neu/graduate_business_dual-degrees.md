2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business is designed to prepare learners to be responsible business leaders of the world capable of working, navigating, and creating in a digital environment. Our [dual degree programs](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/catalog-dual-degrees/) offer a powerful opportunity for students to build their future-forward business skills through an MBA and a deep foundation in another area. Dual degree students earn two degrees simultaneously—an MBA and a second degree from Northeastern.
At Northeastern, experience is at the heart of everything we do. Our experience-powered educational model fuses robust classroom education with real-world application. Students benefit from opportunities to apply what they’ve learned in the classroom to real challenges in business and the industry of their second degree.
Dual degree programs merge select core requirements from a D'Amore-McKim MBA with a master's degree or juris doctorate, allowing students to finish their program in less time than it would take to earn the two degrees separately. This distinctive blend of knowledge and skill positions dual degree students to lead in the two sectors.
