#  Students Studying in The United States 
Learn about what F-1 students are required to report during their 12-month Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) Period. 
###  9/3/25 SEVP Portal Errors Reported 
As of 9/3/25, SEVP has confirmed that there is an issue preventing information from being saved within the SEVP Portal. SEVP is actively working on a fix. In the meantime, alumni may report any updates directly to OGS via OPT Central. Alumni may also take a screenshot of the error message in the SEVP Portal as evidence of their attempt to report within the 10-day reporting window. 
###  Exceeding Unemployment During Post-OPT 
If employment is not updated in the SEVP Portal within 90 days of the start date on your EAD card, or you accrue more than 90 days of unemployment during your Post-OPT period, your SEVIS record may be automatically terminated. It is your responsibility to keep a personal record of all OPT activity. 
##  Reporting Requirements 
###  F-1 Students on an approved period of Post-OPT must comply with all reporting requirements. All reporting must be completed within 10-days of the reportable event in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program Portal (SEVP Portal). 
You _will receive an email with instructions on creating your SEVP Portal once your Post-OPT has been approved and within a few days of the start date on their EAD._
The following must be reported to the SEVP Portal within 10-days of the change or update: 
  * **New employment**
    * You must report the name of the company, the company’s address (this should be the address from where you are conducting your work), your start and end dates with the company, and a description of how your work is related to your major/program of study


  * **Changes to your current employment**
    * This may include ending employment, changing from full-time to part-time employment, change to employer’s address, etc.
  * **Changes to your address or contact information**
    * Report your updated address in the [SEVP Portal](https://sevp.ice.gov/opt/) **and** in [OPT Central in myOGS](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/) (Post-OPT Address Updates e-form) 
      * While all changes made in the SEVP Portal will be reflected in SEVIS, updates submitted to myOGS will serve as confirmation that you have reported your updated address to a DSO


_If for any reason you are unable to report via the SEVP Portal, you may report your changes/updates and any issues with the SEVP Portal_ _to OGS via the OPT Issue Reporting e-form found in_[ _Optional Practical Training Central_](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/) _in myOGS._
###  Failure to Report 
Failing to report Post-OPT employment and/or changes to your employment may result in the automatic termination of your SEVIS record. 
##  Post-OPT Employment 
The following criteria must be met for the duration of your Post-OPT period:
  * You must work a minimum of 20 hours per week
    * This may be with one single employer, or cumulative between multiple employers
  * All work must be directly related to your major/program of study
    * It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the potential employment is related to their major/program of study and to timely report all employment to SEVP
  * You must not exceed the allowed 90-days of unemployment
    * Each day (including weekends) during the period of Post-OPT where you do not have qualifying employment counts as a day of unemployment


When considering work opportunities, the following employment types are permissible for OPT:

  * Multiple employers
  * Work for hire
  * Self-employment/business owner
  * Employment through an agency or consulting firm

##  Additional Requirements While on Post-OPT 
####  [ Be Prepared for a Site Visit ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49039907-1)
It is possible that someone from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may visit the address of your OPT employer to ensure compliance.
OGS has prepared [this resource about site visits and what you can expect. ](https://northeastern.service-now.com/ogs?id=em_kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB000023704)
  * You must log in with your NU credentials to access this resource


####  [ Traveling during Post-OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49039907-2)
> Please review [OGS’ 2025 Current Travel Recommendations](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/post-u-s-election-travel-recommendations/) prior to making plans to travel outside of the United States.
Students on Post-Completion OPT are still in F-1 status and must maintain all F-1 status documents in order to travel abroad. In order to re-enter the U.S., the following documents are required:
  * A passport that is valid for 6 months from the date of your return to the U.S.
  * A valid F-1 student visa
  * A valid I-20 with OPT recommendation and a valid travel signature on page 2* 
    * *Travel signatures are valid for 6 months while you are on OPT.


  * A valid EAD
  * Proof of employment (we recommend carrying paystubs that demonstrate consistent employment) 
    * If you are not currently employed, we do not recommend traveling outside of the U.S. as re-entry to the U.S. is granted at the discretion of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)


Given the information above, travel before an EAD card has been approved and received is not advisable.
Note
[Please see OGS’ page on International Travel for more information](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/international-travel/)
####  [ Studying during Post-OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49039907-3)
While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the Post-Completion OPT period, students cannot pursue a new degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on Post-Completion OPT.

U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers their SEVIS record to another school.
####  [ Discontinuing Post-OPT and Departing the U.S. ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49039907-4)
You must submit the [Post-OPT Central](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/) with a copy of a flight itinerary indicating you have/will depart the U.S.
####  [ Changing my F-1 Status to Another Status (e.g. H-1B) ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49039907-5)
You must report this change to the OGS using the appropriate e-form.

  * You must update your employment end date in the SEVP portal.
  * You must request to have your [SEVIS record transferred](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/transferring-out/) or request a [Change of Degree Level I-20](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/prearrivali20/)


##  Unemployment During Post-OPT 
###  You are permitted to have up to 90-days of unemployment during the Post-OPT period (within the dates of authorization on your EAD). These 90 days will start accruing from the start date listed on your EAD and will stop once you begin working and update your employment in the SEVP Portal. 
####  [ Can I travel outside of the U.S. while I'm unemployed? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49079368-1)
If you are not currently employed, OGS recommends that you do not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
####  [ What happens if I exceed the 90-days of unemployment? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49079368-2)
If you exceed 90-days of unemployment, then you are considered out of status and your SEVIS record may be autoterminated; there is no additional grace period after these 90 days.
####  [ I am nearing 90-days of unemployment - what are my options? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49079368-3)
If you are close to exceeding 90-days of unemployment, you may have a few options:
  * Leave the U.S. before you have exceeded your unemployment days.


  * Apply for and be accepted to a new academic program and request a SEVIS transfer before you’ve exceeded your unemployment days. The new program would need to start within 5 months of the last day of your OPT (based on the transfer out date) in order for you to remain in the U.S. with the same SEVIS record.


  * Submit an application to USCIS for a change of status to another immigration status that allows you to remain in the U.S. while the application is pending. The application must be filed before you exceed your unemployment days.


Please contact OGS if you would like to discuss any of these options.
####  [ I'm eligible for the STEM Extension. Can I use my Post-OPT unemployment days while on the STEM Extension? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/#collapse-49079368-4)
If you are eligible and approved for STEM OPT, any days of unemployment that you did not use during your Post-Completion OPT period may be carried over to your STEM OPT period. 
You can learn more about [STEM OPT and unemployment here.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/)

  * Change your immigration/visa status
  * Enter the U.S. using any visa status other than an F-1
  * Violate your F-1 student status
  * Start a new program of study 
    * While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the Post-Completion OPT period, students cannot pursue a new degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on Post-Completion OPT.


##  SEVP Portal 
The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) Portal is a tool for you as an F-1 student to report your contact information and employer information directly to SEVIS while on Post-Completion OPT. You will be able to see your information in the portal as it is reported in SEVIS and will be able to update it as needed. You will be able to make changes to your address, telephone number, and employer information.
If you experience any of the following issues, you must complete the OPT Issue Reporting section of [OGS Post-Completion OPT Central:](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/)
