# (Re)Making, (Re)Marking: Rhetoric, Genre, and Markup in the Writing Classroom
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
This project studies the writing and experiences of students as they compose XML markup in a series of writing classes taught at Northeastern. In addition to writing their assignments in XML (using Oxygen), these courses engage students in a semester-long, collaborative writing project: the design and implementation of a custom XML schema that structurally and rhetorically models a range of genres of writing. This approach—using XML to produce
The questions guiding this research are relevant to both digital humanities and writing studies audiences. They include: How does markup function rhetorically when used for authorship? Does writing in XML and designing schemas for authoring contribute to students’ understanding of their writing and reading processes? Do reading and writing practices in the markup classroom transfer to other contexts?
Adopting a teacher research methodology, this project adapts qualitative research methods from writing studies, education, and ethnography to gather data on student writing, reading, and thinking processes. Data was gathered from direct participant observation, reflective journaling, qualitative interviews (three interviews each with nine case study students), survey, and the collection of student writing (normal prose and XML, including version control logs for all XML files). Preliminary results point to the surprising mediating and rhetorical roles played by the markup in students’ writing and reading processes—and indeed in the space of the classroom itself—and will generate new insights at the intersection of writing studies and the digital humanities.
