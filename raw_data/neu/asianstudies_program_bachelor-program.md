#  Bachelor of ArtsGlobal Asian Studies
The Bachelor of Arts in Global Asian Studies offers undergraduates a broad liberal arts education in the histories, cultures, societies, politics, economies, and languages of Asia, Asian America, and the global Asian diaspora. Global Asian studies majors complete at least two years of an Asian language in addition to pursuing a rigorous course of study covering a number of disciplines. The core coursework provides foundational knowledge in the history, politics, and societies of East Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, and the Asian diaspora; the place of Asia and Asians within a globalizing world; and skills in research and analysis. Majors are also required to develop expertise in one of the following focus areas: history; society and politics; language, literature, and culture; or religious studies. Finally, students are required to complete academic study or a professional experience abroad.
For a listing of the most current major requirements visit the Registrar’s website. Please note that a key feature of our program is flexibilitycsgs@northeastern.edu to ask so we might evaluate. 
**Required Courses**
  * East Asian Studies (ASNS 1150):
  * The Origins of Today (HIST 1215)

**Language:**
  * Complete coursework in an Asian language through at least intermediate-level two. 
  * Completing this requirement satisfies the language requirement for the BA degree. Students may test out of this requirement at the discretion of the director of global Asian studies. Those credits must be fulfilled through the electives listed under the global Asian studies electives. 
  * Courses taken abroad may be given different numbers but will still count towards the requirement.


**Time Abroad:**
  * This can be credit bearing — a traditional semester abroad, Dialogue of Civilizations or an experiential education project — or an international co-op or internship, or other advisor approved activity.


Finally, in order to bring together this academic experience, students of junior or senior standing are required to complete an upper level capstone course from the following list:
  * Asian Studies Capstone Directed Study (ASNS 4900)
  * Issues in Modern and Contemporary Asia (ASNS 4910)
  * Asian Studies Capstone Seminar (ASNS 4920)


Capstone courses are not offered every semester due to the low number of majors, so if it is needed for a student, it must be requested. Please reach out to csgs@northeastern.edu if you are interested in requesting a capstone.
