#  Master of ScienceEngineering and Public Policy
Northeastern’s Master of Science in Engineering and Public Policy (MSEPP) provides the knowledge and tools needed to extend traditional engineering analysis to be relevant to public policy and decision-making. 
This program covers the core skills necessary to link engineering design and analysis research with the economic and policy contexts needed for decisions that affect society at large. Students study specific engineering applications within one of the concentrations, coupled with fundamental methodologies in policy analysis, economics, and statistics. At the master’s level, there are two concentrations for Engineering and Public Policy: Energy & Environment, and Infrastructure Resilience.
