Digital Humanities is an emerging field of research that is interdisciplinary in scope and collaborative in nature. The field is developing in relation to new digital technologies which have changed the objects of study, methods, and opportunities for research and teaching in existing humanities fields. Digitized texts are now read and accessed in new ways; digitized corpora of texts make possible new modes of quantitative and qualitative analysis (including “distant reading,” text mining, mapping, and network analysis); born digital objects constitute new primary sources in need of humanistic theorization, approaches, and critical vocabularies; and modes of encoding, aggregating, and connecting texts enable the creation of new archival resources that are changing our understanding of the archive itself as well revealing new historical, literary, and cultural patterns.
The field is new and developing rapidly and many students are eager for training in this area—both because DH is at the cutting edge of disciplinary work and because it offers new opportunities for employment within the academy and outside of it.
