##  Master's Co-op 
* * *
Northeastern’s co-op program offers students a unique opportunity to integrate their academic knowledge with industry. Students may gain up to eight months of full-time work experience, allowing them to learn more about their fields through hands-on skills application, build their resumes, earn an income, and gain a competitive edge for post-graduate employment opportunities.
In preparation for a co-op search, students will complete a preparatory course (“Career Management for Engineers” ([ENCP 6000](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?P=ENCP%206000)) or “Introduction to Cooperative Education” ([ENCP 6100](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?P=ENCP%206100))), which provides valuable skills needed to be successful in securing a co-op position and performing during the co-op work experience. During their search period, eligible students work one-on-one with a knowledgeable advisor to prepare their search materials, identify appropriate positions, and hone their networking and interviewing skills to pursue a co-op role.
As part of the co-op program, students may participate in one co-op work experience within a single company during their program of study. Students are permitted to participate in one co-op experience that can range from 4-8 months in duration. The co-op experience may be full-time or half-time.
COE Master’s Degree Students
Toggle Accordion  About COE Co-op 
Participation in a co-op at the master’s degree level is an opportunity for students who have achieved excellent academic progress and success and who demonstrate professionalism to further their learning with workplace experience.
MS students in COE may participate in only one co-op experience during their master’s program. A student who participates in a co-op at the master’s level cannot search for a second co-op, even if they are completing a second master’s degree.
Co-op is not guaranteed for any student and is an optional opportunity available to students who approach their program of study intentionally and mindfully. Students must be approved to search before engaging in a search, following the processes as described below. Students may not apply for jobs outside of the Northeastern co-op job database prior to meeting the search eligibility guidelines and receiving approval via their program’s authorization process.
For COE master’s degree students, “co-op” is meant to include internships, practicums, cooperative education, residencies, and similar programs. All the requirements on this page apply to all these forms of work experience. The [Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership](https://provost.northeastern.edu/gordon/) program is a separate program. Students who apply for and are accepted to that program should contact Amy Manley to obtain help in identifying a Challenge Project Sponsor. Students in this program are not eligible for the co-op program.
Toggle Accordion  Eligibility Requirements 
A co-op search refers to the time when a student is applying to co-op jobs, participating in interviews, and considering offers. The requirements in this section must be met before a student can engage in any of these search activities and they must continue to be met during the entire search process.
Effective starting in the Fall 2025 semester
Students changing degree programs must meet all co-op eligibility requirements for the new program to participate in co-op. Students are encouraged to discuss the impact of changing programs with the appropriate co-op team before or during the application process (i.e., CPS students who transfer to COE need to wait until they have an established a COE GPA before being considered for co-op eligibility). In addition, students who commit to an experiential learning program outside of co-op, including the Gordon Leadership Program, may not also participate in co-op.

Toggle Accordion  Policies During the Co-op Search and Work Experience 
  1. Students may participate in one co-op experience during their master’s program. The co-op experience must be with a single company. 
    1. The length may be one of the following: 
      1. 4 months (Spring, Fall, or Full Summer)
      2. 6 months (Spring plus Summer 1 or Summer 2 plus Fall)
      3. 8 months (Spring plus Full Summer or Full Summer plus Fall)
    2. In addition, students enrolled at a Canadian campus may be placed in co-op assignments for periods of four to twelve months, including continuous periods spanning the Fall and Spring semesters. In the case of eight-month Fall/Spring term co-op assignments, students are required to enroll full-time in classes during the summer term immediately following the assignment. Twelve-month co-ops may only take place from January-December. If a student only needs to take one additional course to complete their program’s requirements, they are only required to enroll in that one class in the summer term immediately following the assignment.


  1. Students must return to at least one on-ground required 4-credit course following the co-op.
  2. COE students who are interested in co-op are representatives of the college and university. In that respect, all students are expected to communicate in a professional tone and manner with co-op department faculty and staff. When students are given access to search for co-op, they must agree to abide by the COE Co-op Performance Agreement. This agreement is housed within NUworks and should be read and understood in its entirety. Below are a few highlights from this agreement. 
    1. Do not apply to, interview for, or accept any internship/co-op jobs within or outside of NUworks before approved – if this occurs you will not be able to work for that employer and may lose your opportunity to participate in the co-op program entirely.
    2. No reneging – once a student commits to an employer the student must honor that commitment and cannot change their mind to work for a different employer.
    3. Must pass all required pre-employment screening – if a student fails a pre-employment screening and has their offer rescinded, they will not be eligible to search for another co-op position.
    4. Must discuss any offers with your co-op coordinator before accepting.
    5. Must honor commitment to employer regarding length of co-op as decided upon at time of offer.
    6. Student visa holders are responsible for understanding and complying with all US government regulations relating to their visa status and CPT or other work authorization. Refer to OGS with any questions.
Additionally, students must adhere to the [university code of conduct](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/handbook/code-student-conduct/) in all interactions with faculty, staff, students, and employer partners. Students who do not adhere to the code or who behave in an unprofessional manner will not be permitted to participate in the co-op program.
  3. A student seeking a cooperative education experience who is disqualified because of violation of co-op performance standards is ineligible to seek a future cooperative education experience. In other words, the student forfeits the opportunity to participate in co-op.
  4. Students who are dismissed from or resign from a co-op job for circumstances under their control will receive a U (unsatisfactory) grade for co-op work experience and be ineligible for other future co-op experiences. In addition, students who are dismissed from or resign from another experiential learning opportunity, such as a PhD Internship or Gordon Project, are not eligible to participate in co-op.
  5. Students on the thesis track must have a conversation with their advisor related to co-op timing and research before completing the Intent to Co-op process and accepting a co-op role.
  6. Full-time co-ops must be a minimum of 32 hours per week. Half-time co-op positions are 16-31 hours/week and require a student to take one 4-credit course concurrently to maintain their full-time student status, unless the co-op is during a summer vacation term. A full-time co-op cannot be changed to or extended into a part-time co-op. International students should consult with OGS to determine whether pre-OPT can be used for a part-time role.
  7. International students must: 
    1. Have a valid I-20/DS-2019.
    2. Obtain CPT/AT authorization and approval for any paid or unpaid work experience prior to starting work.
    3. Comply with all requirements of their student visa.
  8. During co-op, a student’s primary focus should be on the co-op work experience. 
    1. Other Work During Co-op  
Students may not hold a graduate stipend assistantship at the university during the semesters planned for co-op.  
Students should not hold any other job without prior approval from their co-op coordinator. If a student holds a second job, the co-op job must always be the priority. The job cannot be more than 8 hours per week and must take place outside the hours of the co-op role.
    2. Courses During Co-op  
Half-time Co-op:Students on a half-time remote co-op must take a 4-credit on-ground course while on co-op to maintain full-time student status during the spring or fall semester. Students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Full-time Co-op:Students may not take a course during full-time co-op without special approval from their co-op departmentall the following
      1. The course must be online or meet after 5pm of the student’s co-op job’s time zone. The work schedule cannot be changed to accommodate a course. The final exam and any other course requirements occur on the weekend or after 5pm of the student’s co-op job’s time zone.
      2. The course cannot be during an accelerated term (i.e., summer 1, summer 2, or winter intercession).
      3. The course must not have a lab, recitation, or other co-requisite.
      4. The course must not be an Experiential Project course.
      5. The student must have demonstrated high academic excellence by holding a GPA of 3.67 or higher.
      6. The student cannot hold an on-campus job.
  9. Remote Co-ops for International Students  
Please consult the [Office of Global Service website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/f-1-curricular-practical-training/) for more information about engaging in a remote or hybrid (defined as working more than 50% of the time remotely), full-time co-op and maintaining on-ground presence. If enrolled in a 100% remote full-time co-op or in a hybrid co-op, students must follow provided instructions to meet on-ground presence requirements.
