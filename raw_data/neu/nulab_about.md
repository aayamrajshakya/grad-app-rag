# About
The NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science 
NULab supports [research projects](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/projects) and scholarly exchanges through [grants](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/seedling-grants/) and other programs; convenes a group of [core faculty](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/community/faculty-and-staff/) who teach a wide range of [courses](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/teaching/courses/) and [publish](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/publications/) broadly in the digital realm; trains graduate students in DH and CSS skills through our [Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/dh-certificate/) and [NULab Fellows](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/community/fellows/) programs; sponsors [talks and symposia](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/events); offers support to [visiting scholars](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/visiting-scholars/) in partnership with Northeastern’s [Digital Scholarship Group](http://dsg.neu.edu/); helps to bring digital and computational methods into a broad range of classes through our [Digital Integration Teaching Initiative](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/); and provides fora for discussions of technology, teaching, and research at Northeastern. 
The NULab works in close collaboration with the [Digital Scholarship Group](https://dsg.northeastern.edu/), an applied research group based in the Northeastern University Library that supports digital modes of research, publication, and collaboration at Northeastern. Many faculty and graduate student research projects at Northeastern are affiliated with both the DSG and the NULab; the two groups co-sponsor a Visiting Scholars Program, as well as the [NUDIGITAL](http://dsg.neu.edu/nudigital/) listserv and Slack workspaces; and many of the NULab’s events are co-hosted with the DSG as part of the DH Open Office Hours series. As a Library-based applied research group, the DSG provides support for research projects through guidance in best practices for designing and managing collaborative digital research endeavors; the DSG can also provide support in software access, server space, and installation of WordPress, Omeka, and OGS. Learn more about becoming a DSG-affiliated project at the [DSG projects page](https://dsg.northeastern.edu/projects/new-projects/). 
The NULab also often partners with the [Centers for Digital Scholarship](https://cds.library.northeastern.edu/) to host workshops and presentations on work in progress, offer opportunities for mutual mentorship, and share in a space for digital creativity. All are welcome for regular events and workshops in the CDS. Learn more about [available spaces](https://cds.library.northeastern.edu/cds-spaces/using-the-space/).
Goals Statement
The NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science fosters interdisciplinary collaboration, bridging the gaps between technology, the humanities, and social science. We encourage scholars to use digital and computational methods to explore critical social and cultural challenges, with a focus on social justice, ethics, and equity. Our ongoing goals include:
  * Incubating Interdisciplinary Collaboration:
  * Committing to Critical Systemic Change:
  * Supporting Emerging Scholars:
  * Advancing Digital Innovation:


Through these efforts, NULab offers a dynamic and creative space for innovative research and collaboration.
NULab acknowledges the support of the College of Social Sciences and Humanities and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
