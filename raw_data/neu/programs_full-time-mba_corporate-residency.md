## FAQs 
How do I find a corporate residency? 
The Graduate Career Center team will connect you with its extensive network of corporate partners as you search for opportunities and interview with firms that align with your career goals.

While most students secure corporate residency positions with one of D'Amore-McKim's corporate partners, you can leverage your contacts to create a unique corporate residency experience. If you wish to pursue a self-developed corporate residency, your career advisor will help you introduce the corporate residency concept to your target companies and approve the job descriptions.
Where can I complete my corporate residency? 
You can work remotely, in person, or a hybrid format. You'll find the location and work arrangement expectations in the job description. If you are an international student, you may be required to work in person.
Can I do more than one corporate residency? 
Yes, if you're in the [Full-Time MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/), [Full-Time MS in Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-finance-mba/), or [Full-Time MS in Quantitative Finance/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-quantitative-finance-mba/) programs, you can complete two residencies.

Your employer will set your pay rate based on your responsibilities. Generally, corporate residents earn a wage comparable to other employees with similar responsibilities. In 2024, corporate residents earned $34.98 per hour on average, with some corporate residents making up to $92 per hour.
