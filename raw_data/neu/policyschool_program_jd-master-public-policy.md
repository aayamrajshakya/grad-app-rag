#  JD/MasterPublic Policy
The JD/Master of Public Policy (MPP) is designed to equip graduates with a unique blend of skills for navigating a complex and rapidly changing policy landscape. The program builds on students’ legal training with a compelling blend of skills in applied public policy analysis, policy design, and strategic policy formation. Students also gain career-relevant experience through internships, small group capstone projects, and other interactions with professionals in the field. All are part of a learning process designed to enable the Northeastern law and public policy graduates to navigate, and to redefine, diverse policy areas.
Ideally, students would apply to Northeastern’s JD and MPP programs simultaneously. Those who apply and are admitted to both programs take MPP classes after completing their first year in the School of Law. Applicants may also be considered after they have enrolled in the JD program; interested JD students should consult the School of Law’s Office of Academic and Student Affairs and the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs graduate program director for more information.
Students enrolled in this dual-degree program will be able to count 8 JD credit hours toward their MPP degree and 12 MPP credit hours toward their JD degree. Students should consult advisors in each program if they have questions about which courses may be shared between degrees.
All JD students, including FlexJD students, are ordinarily eligible to apply into dual degree pathways.
