## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ### HIST 1200 / 1201: First Year Seminar
#### HIST 1200 / HIST 1201
Provides an introduction to historical methods, research, writing, and argument in which all students produce a substantial research project that passes through at least two revisions, and that is presented publicly to other members of the colloquium. 
  * ### HIST 1357: History of Information in the United States
#### HIST 1357
In an age of digital media, deepfakes, and data surveillance, information is a fraught concept. While it’s tempting to see anxieties about information as new, Americans struggled with the ethics and politics of information long before tweeting or TikTok. Information has a history, one shaped and scarred by society and culture. By diving deep into the history of information in the United States, and by paying close attention to the laws, technologies, and politics that surround its collection and use, students will develop more sophisticated understandings of ongoing controversies over information and big data. 


### HIST 1190: Picturing Modernity, The Photographic Image in Culture and Society
#### HIST 1190
Explores the role of the photographic image in culture and society from the early nineteenth century to the present day. Examines how the photographic image has altered cultural and perceptual patterns across the globe and investigates how cultural and social power have been influenced by photographs. Offers students an opportunity to read a cross-section of criticism, theory, and history and to study images and exhibitions to analyze how culture and history have been affected by and reflected in photographic images.
