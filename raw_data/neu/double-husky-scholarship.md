## Rejoin the pack
The Double Husky Scholarship provides a 25% tuition discount to Northeastern alumni enrolled in an eligible full- or part-time master’s degree, graduate certificate program, or doctorate degree.
As an alum, you’ll be automatically considered for the scholarship upon admission—no special application is required. Upon acceptance, you’ll receive a letter indicating the tuition discount that applies to your program.
If you are offered other grant aid from the university, only the scholarship of higher value will apply. Those completing pass-through degrees—such as a PlusOne accelerated master’s program—do not qualify for the Double Husky Scholarship.
