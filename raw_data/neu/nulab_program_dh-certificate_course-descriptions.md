ENGL 7380 Topics in Digital HumanitiesReading Machines: Technology and the Book:[described by N. Katherine Hayles and Jessica Pressman](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/comparative-textual-media) as “comparative textual media.” We will take this comparative, interdisciplinary approach first to better understand machines of reading
**ENGL 7380** : Developed at the intersection of theory and practice, this course will introduce students to queer theory in the context of digital curation. Digital curation refers to the selection, organization, preservation, and representation of digital resources; it is largely focused on efficiency, structure, and use. Queer theory, on the other hand, critically investigates cultural normativities related to sex, sexuality, and gender; it often values disruption, deconstruction, and play. A queer approach to digital curation, then, will allow us to unpack the invisible norms of digital environments as we think through the effects of digital tools, particularly those used for social justice purposes. There will be a hands-on unit of this course; however, prior knowledge of LGBTQ+ issues or the digital humanities is not expected––all students are welcome in this course.
**ENGL 7380** In this project-based course, students will explore using coding and creative computation to generate and remix their own creative works. Students will learn about some key moments in the history of programmed text while creating their own. An essential question is how have, and how can, writers use computational and digital practices to create meaningful, engaging, and relevant writing. A significant portion of the course will explore using Python to create small programs like chatbots, poem generators, and prose generators; and using Python to explore features of text. Other detours may include HTML and JavaScript for web-based work, and literary and interactive fiction games. No prior technical expertise is required to take the course but students should be willing to experiment with new skills—this course is designed for writers and literary types with little to no programming experience, so all are welcome!
