Curriculum features 
  * Senior leaders in higher education contributed to the design of the program curriculum and provided input around in-demand skills they look for in new hires.
  * The program’s curriculum is intentionally designed to include DEI coursework in subject matter areas such as social justice and demographics of the new college student. Students also learn about historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), tribal colleges, and the pressing need for all-women colleges.


Networking opportunities 
  * Students and alumni of the program are invited to participate in the Graduate School of Education residency poster session, a networking opportunity where attendees exchange ideas on innovation and change work in the field.
  * Becoming part of the Northeastern Graduate School of Education connects you to a network of leaders in education through renowned faculty and distinguished alumni.
  * Students participate in the Graduate School of Education summer convening to connect and be inspired by fellow students and faculty.


Capstone course 
Through the required capstone course, students work with a problem within higher education for six weeks. Throughout this time, students conduct in-depth research on the topic of interest and present their findings to two to three mid- and senior-level practitioners, who then provide insight on the issue. Students also have the opportunity to perform a mock interview with a practitioner in the field and are given guidance-sometimes landing jobs right on the spot. Students are then prompted to write a reflection piece at the end of the course and are encouraged to map out a lifelong learning plan.
