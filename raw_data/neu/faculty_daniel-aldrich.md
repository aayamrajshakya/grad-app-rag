#### POLS / PPUA 7346
This class prepares students to understand the characteristics of resilient cities, especially those in coastal regions. We’ll investigate the concept of resilience in social and ecological systems and work through classical works on cities and social systems. Our focus will be on four extended case studies of the 1923 Tokyo earthquake, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina. By the end of the course students will work to write their own qualitative and quantitative analysis of an urban area along with recommendations for improving its resilience. Through readings, research, class discussion, and lectures, students will be able to identify and measure resilience in cities.
