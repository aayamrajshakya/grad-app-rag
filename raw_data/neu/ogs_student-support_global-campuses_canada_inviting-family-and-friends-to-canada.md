##  INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO ATTEND YOUR GRADUATION CEREMONY 
With the exception of US citizens and permanent residents, most visitors will require either a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), also known as a visitor visa, or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to travel to Canada. The type of document needed to enter Canada depends on the traveler’s country of citizenship and mode of travel. Visit [this government of Canada’s page ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/about-visitor-visa.html)to learn more about whether a visa or eTA will be required.
If a TRV is required, [click here ](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/applications/visa.asp)to find out more about the process of applying for a visa. If an eTA is required, please visit this site 
We also recommend reaching out to the local Visa Application Center within the country that your family members are in to apply for a visitor visa. [Click here ](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/offices/find-visa-application-centre.html)to view a full list.
Stating the purpose of the visit is an important part of applying for a visa. The University does not provide letters to graduates as a means for their guests to apply for a visa from their country to attend a graduation ceremony. 
  * Graduation application.
  * E-mail(s) directed to the graduate with ceremony information.
  * An official letter of enrollment from Northeastern (for current students). Please check the Expected Graduation Date on the Enrollment Letter and if it doesn’t accurately reflect the date that you will be completing your studies, you need to work with your Academic Advisor to have it updated, prior to submitting it to IRCC. 
    * The enrolment letter can be requested from the Registrar’s office by following [these instructions](https://northeastern.service-now.com/kb_view.do?sysparm_article=KB000022937).


  * Letter of Invitation written by the person graduating including proof of date of graduation ceremony. You can see [here](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/letters-of-invitation/) for more information about writing a Letter of Invitation.


Other Supporting Documents Required
The following are some of the other supporting documents that may be required for a visa application. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, so please refer to [this Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship (IRCC) page ](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/applications/visa.asp)for more information.
