2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Nanomedicine is a flexible, interdisciplinary, industry-aligned professional master's degree program. It is designed for scientists, engineers, and clinicians who want to develop competencies and skills in nanomedicine research, innovation, and commercialization. Our students receive hands-on training in nanomedicine challenges and opportunities, research tools and techniques, and translation from bench to bedside. The curriculum integrates immersive individual and team-based research projects with a full-time industry co-op or laboratory experience to prepare graduates for high-demand research and entrepreneurship roles in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, biomedical, and healthcare industries.
This two-year, full-time master’s program consists of eight core courses and year-round professional seminars. In year two, students tailor their curriculum by selecting a concentration and at least one experiential learning opportunity. A reflection capstone course is taken concurrently with co-op or during the final semester of study. Students seeking additional course and co-op flexibility may substitute an electives only program plan in place of a concentration.
## Concentration in Nanoformulation Research 
The nanoformulation research concentration integrates nanoparticle design, formulation, characterization, and translation. Students gain experience in nanomedicine theory, materials and methods, advanced laboratory techniques, and state-of-the-art instrumentation through a combination of expert-led lectures, instrument demonstrations, and collaborative interdisciplinary project-based laboratory experiences. Students have an opportunity to acquire research and project management skills for roles in research, development, and manufacturing. 
## Concentration in Translation and Commercialization 
The translation and commercialization concentration studies scientific discovery, business, and management from the perspective of delivering nanomedicine products to patients. Students build real-world knowledge and skills in innovation, business development, and regulatory affairs—from initial discovery and research and development to FDA approval and launch—through a combination of case studies, industry-mentored projects, and creation of a virtual startup company. 
## Concentration in Vaccine Development Concentration 
Innovations in nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic have fundamentally changed the way we develop and test vaccines. The vaccine development concentration provides training in scientific, business, and regulatory principals of vaccine research and development. Students integrate molecular tools for vaccine design, knowledge of vaccine-tissue interactions, and best practices for biopharmaceutical cell culture and manufacturing to develop the industry-aligned skills needed at the forefront of vaccine development.
