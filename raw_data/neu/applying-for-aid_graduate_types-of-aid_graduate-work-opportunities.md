## Graduate Work Opportunities
Federal Work-Study is a need-based federally subsidized program that provides part-time employment to students. To be eligible, students must demonstrate financial need, as determined by the FAFSA. For students who would like to be considered for Federal Work-Study, it is important to ensure your FAFSA is submitted by the [priority filing deadline date of March 1](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/graduate/how-to-apply/), as this is a limited fund.
Students who secure a work-study position are typically paid through direct deposit and may use their earnings to help with expenses during the academic year.
There are also a number of general student employment opportunities available for eligible students. The amount you earn will be determined by your pay rate and hours worked.
