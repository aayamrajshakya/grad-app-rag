# The View From Lower Allston
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
This photogrammetry project seeks to document and contextualize the street art found all over a popular footbridge in the neighborhood of Allston. The writings and visual materials found in this well-trafficked space are in frequent conversation with one another and with the residents of the neighborhood. Art on the footbridge is changing constantly and contains records of lived experiences in a neighborhood that is itself in flux, due to its transient student population, ongoing gentrification efforts spearheaded by Harvard University development efforts, the city’s own massive Allston Multimodal Project, and the uncertainty caused by COVID-19 (among other factors). The forms of expression found there vary: we see artwork, poems, anger, protest, snapshots of city life, records of voices obscured or silenced elsewhere.
