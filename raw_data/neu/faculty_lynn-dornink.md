#  LynnDornink
Part-Time Lecturer in English; Director of the General Studies Program 
Lynn Dornink specializes in teaching first year writing courses. She enjoys working with students who tell her that they, “don’t like writing,” and takes it as a personal challenge to convince them otherwise. She uses a variety of media in her classes, but especially likes teaching graphic novels, film, and poetry. 
In her spare time she can be found attempting to bathe her mangy dog, Lana Turner, and reading Entertainment Weekly. She is also the Director of the General Studies Program.
