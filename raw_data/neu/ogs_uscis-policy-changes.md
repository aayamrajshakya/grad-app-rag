> ### **August 19, 2025: USCIS Considers “Anti-American” Activity when Adjudicating Applications**
When adjudicating certain immigration benefit requests, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) officers will now consider whether an applicant has:
“...endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused anti-American views or the views of a terrorist organization or group (including in social media content by, or involving an alien). This includes organizations who support or promote anti-American ideologies or activities, antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, antisemitic ideologies, or has engaged in physical harassment of any person in furtherance of the organization or group...” 
This may impact individuals submitting a variety of application to USCIS, including:
  * Applications for**F-1 reinstatement** ;


  * Most applications for Employment Authorization Documents (EADs), including**F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT), F-1 STEM OPT** , H-4 EADs, and adjustment of status EADs;


  * Applications for extensions or changes of status; 


  * Applications for a National Interest Waiver; and

> ### April 11, 2025: USCIS Policy Changes of "Antisemitic Activity"
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a policy change that may impact international students, scholars, and other noncitizens applying for U.S. immigration benefits.
Effective immediately, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will consider involvement in "antisemitic activity"—including social media content that supports or promotes antisemitic terrorism or organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or the Houthis—as a negative factor in immigration benefit requests.
This policy may affect F-1 students applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), STEM OPT, Economic Hardship, Special Student Relief, etc., and other F/J individuals applying for immigration benefits via USCIS. We encourage members of the Northeastern international student and scholar community to review the full announcement here:
