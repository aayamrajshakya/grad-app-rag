Financial Assistance
Northeastern University offers graduate students a variety of means of financial assistance. [Assistantships](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-tuition-financial-aid/#assistantship) are awarded on merit by individual graduate schools and administrative offices. Additionally, [Student Financial Services](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/graduate/) administers financial aid programs for graduate students, primarily in the form of loans, including Federal Perkins Loans, Federal Work Study, and Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans. The financial aid application process can be rigorous and is strictly regulated.
### Funding Opportunities
The Graduate School of Engineering offers full-time graduate students various types of highly competitive funding awards based on merit, as well as prestigious fellowships.
Note: All assistantship and fellowship appointments are considered a financial resource and may impact a student’s financial aid (if applicable) award as determined by Student Financial Services.

Assistantships
The Graduate School of Engineering awards Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGAs) to students with strong academic backgrounds. SGAs are typically awarded to PhD students. Awardees are offered a stipend, health insurance waiver, and tuition remission for approved coursework. In exchange, students must work 20 hours per week for the applicable semesters. Stipends are considered taxable income.
SGA’s are typically awarded upon acceptance to a degree program. Continuing students interested in a GRA or GTA should discuss their interest with their academic advisor.
Types of SGAs:
  * Graduate Research Assistantships (GRA) are awarded to students who have a strong academic background and demonstrate an interest and proficiency in research. These appointments are typically funded by research grants made to faculty members by industry or governmental agencies. The continuation of any GRA is contingent upon funding availability.
  * Graduate Teaching Assistantships (GTA) are awarded by academic departments and are available to students with proficiency in teaching. These positions generally require the performance of teaching-related duties such as grading, conducting recitations and laboratories, and occasionally teaching undergraduate classes. GTAs are required to attend various training sessions and workshops sponsored by the College of Engineering and the University. In addition, GTAs who speak English as a second language must attend training sessions sponsored by Global Student Services.
