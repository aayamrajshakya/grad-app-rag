#  Graduate CertificateSustainability and Climate Change Policy
The graduate certificate in Sustainability and Climate Change Policy, a collaboration between the School of Public Policy (SPPUA) and the School of Law (NUSL), is designed to prepare students for the dynamic, evolving landscape of climate and sustainability policy. Interest in the area of climate and sustainability policy is expanding rapidly among graduate students in multiple programs throughout Northeastern and among professionals who may be considering graduate coursework at Northeastern. 
This certificate provides students from multiple backgrounds an option for gaining interdisciplinary skills and perspectives in Climate and Sustainability Policy. Given the growing need in every organization, including private sector, public sector and non-profits, for professionals with knowledge and training in how to respond to the rapidly changing policy and regulatory frameworks in climate and sustainability, this certificate is open to JD, Masters and PhD students throughout the university. 
This certificate is also available to professionals who have not yet been admitted to one of Northeastern’s graduate programs.
