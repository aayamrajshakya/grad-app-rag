Founded in 1922, the D’Amore-McKim School of Business exemplifies Northeastern University’s experiential learning and entrepreneurial spirit. Our graduate programs are designed to prepare learners to be responsible business leaders of the world capable of working, navigating, and creating in a digital environment.
D’Amore-McKim is part of a thriving global network, attracting some of the best and brightest faculty across the business world. Many are founders of startups and respected management leaders, and our students benefit daily from their research and expertise.
Experience-powered learning is at the heart of everything we do. Our students do more than master skills in their chosen business field. They put the knowledge gained from a demanding curriculum to work as they apply what they’ve learned to authentic business challenges. This educational model sets us apart.
