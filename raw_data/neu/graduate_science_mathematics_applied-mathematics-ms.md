2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
New applications of mathematics are constantly being discovered, and established techniques are being applied in new ways and in emerging fields. Northeastern University's Master of Science in Applied Mathematics caters to students who are looking to enter or who are currently working in a variety of applied math careers such as data science and high-tech firms, computer information and software firms, financial service and investment firms, academic institutions, and research institutes. Northeastern’s master's program offers students an opportunity to obtain solid knowledge of mathematical modeling, statistics, and data analysis, as well as excellent programming skills, through experiential learning and co-op experiences from industry.
Students may complete a data science concentration, an operations research concentration, or an electives option. The value of the worldwide Big Data market is growing exponentially. Data science rooted in applied mathematics is essential in exploring Big Data from a wide range of science, businesses, and industries. The operations research concentration offers students study of the analytical and computational skills necessary to enhance efficiency and support decision making across diverse industries such as logistics, finance, and engineering. The electives option allows students to personalize their education with more in-depth knowledge of data science, statistics, or other areas of interest in applied mathematics.
## Data Science Concentration
Data science is an interdisciplinary field using techniques and theories drawn from mathematics, statistics, computer science, information science, and related fields to uncover insights hidden in data and to make predictions and decisions. The data science concentration offers students opportunities to learn mathematical modeling, probability, and statistics, which are the theoretical background for data science. Courses in data visualization; machine learning and deep learning; statistical inference; algorithmic, numerical, and computational thinking; experimental design; and coding are also offered. The program offers a multimodal approach including lecture courses, data-driven computer labs, and industry projects. Some courses listed for this program are in collaboration with the College of Engineering and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences.
## Operations Research Concentration
The operations research concentration offers students an opportunity to obtain a deep understanding of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques to solve complex operational problems. This concentration emphasizes areas such as decision analysis, stochastic processes, and advanced optimization to prepare students to tackle real-world challenges in fields like supply chain management, finance, and systems engineering. By integrating applied mathematics with problem-solving methodologies, students may gain the analytical and computational skills needed to enhance efficiency and inform decision making in both industry and research settings. Some courses listed for this program are offered in the College of Engineering.
## Electives Option
Applications of mathematical modeling and methods are widely involved in different fields such as computer science, engineering, finance, health science, social science, artificial intelligence, etc. The electives option allows students to design their advanced coursework around an area of specific interest, pursue personalized training in applied mathematics, or strengthen an application to a PhD program.
