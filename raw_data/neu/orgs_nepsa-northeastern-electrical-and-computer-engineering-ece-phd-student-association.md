#  NEPSA: Northeastern Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) PhD Student Association 
Our mission is to foster a supportive community among doctoral students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering by creating opportunities for academic enrichment, professional development, and socializing. As the liaison between ECE PhD students and the ECE department chair, we facilitate communication and act as a channel for doctoral students’ concerns. We provide academic enrichment through student-invited guest speakers, student presentations, and other events. We offer professional development through workshops and seminars. We organize social activities where students can share their knowledge and experiences, and develop friendships and collaborations.
