## Discovering Northeastern University
For Geraldine Ndukwu, the path to Northeastern started with a simple online search. “I found Northeastern while researching schools on Google,” she recalls. What stood out to her were the glowing reviews from students who praised the university for its support and co-op opportunities. For an international student like Geraldine, these aspects were invaluable.
“I was interested because the school offers a co-op opportunity, which is highly impressive and an advantage, especially for international students who don’t have Canadian expertise,” Geraldine explains.
## Why project management?
Geraldine’s choice of a [Master’s of Science in Project Management](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-project-management-toronto-14370/) in the [College of Professional Studies](https://cps.northeastern.edu/) wasn’t just about advancing her career; it was about gaining skills that would be relevant in any industry. “Project management is something that is vital in almost all industries,” she notes. “It also helps me manage my personal projects better.”
For her, the flexibility and wide applicability of project management made Northeastern’s program a perfect fit.
## Thriving as an international student
Moving to a new country for graduate school comes with challenges, but Northeastern’s support network for international students helped Geraldine overcome them. “At first, it was difficult adapting to the system,” she shares. “But as time went on, it became a lot easier. I had to adjust my schedule and learn how to manage my time effectively.”
Geraldine graduated in 2023 and had an overwhelmingly positive experience at the [Toronto campus](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/global-campus-network/toronto-campus/). “Toronto feels like home to me because of the support we get from the school and the staff,” Geraldine says. “They provide support regardless of race or where you’re from. The support I’ve received has made all the difference.”
When asked what advice she would give to other international students, Geraldine enthusiastically recommends Northeastern. “Honestly, my experience has been quite interesting. I’ve learned how to face my fears, instead of running away from them, through the quality support from the staff.”

## Preparing for future success
Geraldine’s Northeastern education provided her with more than just knowledge; it equipped her with the skills she needed to thrive in real-world professional contexts. “The project management skills I’ve gained—such as communication, leadership, and analytical skills—are applicable across all industries. And, I’ve developed [softer] skills like time management and critical thinking that have helped me manage my time and learn how to collaborate with others.”
Looking ahead, Geraldine feels confident that the skills she acquired at Northeastern will set her up for success. “The list of skills I’ve acquired is endless. I know these skills will help me excel.”
