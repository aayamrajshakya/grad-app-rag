#  HumanServices
The Human Services program prepares students for careers in social change by providing students with the theoretical and skill-based background necessary for practice and research.
This major strives to provide a holistic educational experience for all of our students. Consistent with CSSH’s Experiential Liberal Arts (ELA) emphasis, our students combine Northeastern’s signature focus on experiential learning, grounded in co-operative education, with the rigorous study of society, culture, politics, and ethics in a way that is mutually reinforcing.
