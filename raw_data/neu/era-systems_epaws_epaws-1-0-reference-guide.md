## Welcome to ePAWs 1.0!
ePAWs (Electronic Proposal Approval and Workflow System) is a simple proposal development tool used to prepare proposals for institutional review and approval.
ePAWs was designed to reduce the administrative burden on investigators and college administrators, to provide a transparent tracking tool visible to all, and to collect the necessary approvals and certifications required by the funding agencies.
Here are a few of the advantages of using ePAWs:
  * Using a single page web-based form, ePAWs users can create proposals and submit for review and approval within minutes
  * Users across colleges can see summary information on research happening in other colleges on the ePAWs Dashboard
  * With ePAWs, Investigators now certify electronically!


To get started with ePAWs, [login](https://coeus-web.neu.edu/epaws/login) with your myNEU username and password.
