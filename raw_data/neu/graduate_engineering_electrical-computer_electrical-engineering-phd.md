## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The PhD program in electrical engineering offers students an opportunity for study in a broad range of areas in electrical engineering. Details on PhD requirements can be found in the Graduate Program Guide.
## Qualifying Exam and Degree Candidacy
The PhD qualifying exam is the examination for admissions to the doctoral programs in electrical engineering and in computer engineering. The exam has the dual purposes of serving as an indicator of the student’s capability for successful completion of the PhD in electrical engineering or in computer engineering and of serving as a guide to the student’s advisor in developing a suitable plan of study, tailored to the individual needs of the student. 
A student who has matriculated into the PhD program is considered a predoctoral student, whether they are BS entry or advanced entry. Upon successful completion of the qualifying exam, the student is designated a PhD candidate. A student who fails the qualifying exam will be permitted to retake the exam only one more time.
## Annual Review
PhD students are reviewed annually. Each student is evaluated and receives a grade of satisfactory, needs improvement, or unsatisfactory. 
## Residence Requirement
After reaching PhD candidacy, one year of full-time graduate work or two consecutive years of part-time graduate work satisfy the university residence requirement. In the latter case, the student’s advisor must approve a detailed schedule in order to ensure that the student devotes at least half of the time to the requirements of the Graduate School of Engineering.
## Dissertation
Within one year of passing the PhD qualifying exam, the PhD candidate must form a dissertation committee. A dissertation committee must have at least three members that hold a PhD or equivalent degree. At least two of the committee members must be tenured or tenure-track ECE faculty and the committee must include the student’s advisor. The chair of the committee must be a tenured or tenure-track faculty member in the ECE department.
The dissertation committee must design an appropriate program of study that prepares the student to be a successful doctoral-level engineer as well as direct the candidate’s dissertation research. The dissertation committee will approve the dissertation in final form.
### Dissertation and Dissertation Continuation Registration
Upon successful completion of the PhD qualifying exam and the required coursework, the PhD candidate must register in two consecutive semesters for Dissertation Term 1 (EECE 9990)Dissertation Term 2 (EECE 9991)Dissertation Continuation (EECE 9996)
### Registration Requirements for Predoctoral and PhD Candidate Graduate Assistants
The ECE department requires that predoctoral students and PhD candidates who hold research or teaching assistantships be registered full-time. Predoctoral PhD students may register for Research (EECE 9986)
### PhD Proposal Review
Each PhD candidate must demonstrate, by means of the proposal review, subject matter knowledge satisfactory for the award of the degree.
The proposal review is an oral presentation followed by a question-and-answer session administered by the student’s dissertation advisor/committee. The proposal review will be given at the time the student submits their dissertation proposal to the dissertation advisor/committee for approval. As part of this exam, the dissertation advisor/committee will review the student’s doctoral program and their performance in graduate courses, as well as examine the student on subject matter related to their graduate coursework and dissertation subject area.
### Final Dissertation Defense
The final dissertation defense will include the subject matter of the dissertation and significant developments in the field of the dissertation work. Other related fields may be included if recommended by the examining faculty. The dissertation defense must be scheduled at least six months after the PhD proposal review.
