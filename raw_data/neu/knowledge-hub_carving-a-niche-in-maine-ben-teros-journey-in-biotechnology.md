Ben Tero, a master’s student at Northeastern University’s [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), always knew he wanted to stay close to his roots. Growing up in Portland, Maine, Ben found himself drawn to the idea of balancing the bustling energy of the city with the natural beauty surrounding it. But his real passion lay in science, and when he discovered the [MS in Biotechnology](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-biotechnology-portland-18387/) program at Northeastern, he knew he’d found the right balance between innovation and local opportunity.
## Finding his path in biotechnology
“I’ve always had an interest in science and asking the ‘why’ questions,” Ben shares, reflecting on his journey into biotechnology. After earning his undergraduate degree from the University of Maine, Ben worked in an academic research lab for several years. But something was missing—he wanted to take a more independent role in running projects and gain real-world industry experience.
That’s when the Roux Institute came into the picture. Ben knew the program was exactly what he needed to combine his love for science with the industry connections necessary to grow in his career. “For me, the ability to take courses while also continuing working was a huge benefit,” Ben says. “I’m not only gaining experience in the lab, but I’m also learning the technical background through my coursework.”
## Learning by doing: a unique educational experience
One of the standout features of Northeastern’s biotechnology program is the [hands-on learning approach](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/academics-outcomes/our-learning-model/). Ben and his classmates often get the chance to work in local labs and engage with professionals in the industry. “We’re able to go see labs in Maine and work in them, seeing firsthand what a job might look like in the future,” Ben explains.
For Ben, this was a defining part of his education—a chance to merge classroom learning with practical, real-world experience. Whether it’s visiting Jackson Labs or the Mount Desert Island Biological Laboratory (MDIBL), the program gives students access to some of the most cutting-edge facilities in Maine.

## Building a professional network in Maine
The connections Ben has made through his program have been invaluable. Northeastern’s Roux Institute serves as a hub for collaboration, bringing together academic institutions like the University of Maine and industry giants like IDEXX and Abbott. “The different players across the state are coming together at the direction of the Roux,” Ben says. “I’ve been able to make connections at all of these institutions.”
In fact, Ben’s current co-op project was born out of an interaction between his boss and a collaborator from the Roux. “It’s been amazing to work on a collaborative project between our labs and see how partnerships can develop,” he adds. This experience has not only enriched Ben’s education but also expanded his professional network, giving him direct access to future career opportunities.
## Balancing life in Portland
While Ben’s academic and professional pursuits keep him busy, he’s found a deep appreciation for the balance that [living in Portland](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/global-campus-network/portland-campus/) offers. “Portland is amazing. It’s a great combination of enough city to make it fun, but also not too busy,” he says. The nearby ocean, national parks, and outdoor activities provide the perfect escape when he needs a break from the lab. “I’ve been able to balance everything here really nicely, with a strong academic environment and a great social environment.”
Having grown up in Portland, Ben is committed to staying in Maine and making a difference in the state’s biotechnology landscape. “Even though Maine isn’t a hub like Boston, there’s still a lot of power in the people we have here,” he says.
## Looking to the future
As Ben looks ahead to completing his master’s degree, he knows that the skills and connections he’s gained will set him up for success. “The co-op experience is giving me something concrete that I can add to my resumé,” he explains. “It’s one thing to learn in the classroom, but it’s another to apply it in a real-world setting.”
With a passion for science and a desire to make a tangible impact in the biotechnology field, Ben is ready to take the next step in his career—right here in Maine.
