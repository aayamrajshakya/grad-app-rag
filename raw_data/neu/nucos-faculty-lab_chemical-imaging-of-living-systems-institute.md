## People
  * ### [Ke Zhang](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/ke-zhang/)
Research in the Zhang Lab is highly interdisciplinary. While their core research is polymer chemistry, they utilize a range of organic reactions, colloidal syntheses, and bioconjugation techniques to access our synthetic targets. Unlike those of an organic chemist, their targets are usually much larger, oftentimes large enough to be visualized by electronic or atomic microscopy […]
  * ### [Steven Lopez](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/steven-lopez/)
Office location: ISEC 313
  * ### [Leila Deravi](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/leila-deravi/)
Integrating materials, biochemistry, and design at Northeastern University.
  * ### [Neel S. Joshi](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/neel-joshi/)
Research in the Joshi lab broadly deals with topics related to biologically inspired materials, protein engineering, self-assembly, and biointerfaces. The group generally works at the intersection of biomaterials science and synthetic biology. A major focus of the group’s research is on Engineered Living Materials, especially in genetically programming microbial cells to secrete and direct the […]
  * ### [Vivek Venkatachalam](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/vivek-venkatachalam/)
Professor Venkatachalam’s group develops tools to measure and manipulate whole-brain activity in freely-behaving animals.
  * ### [Bryan Spring](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/bryan-spring/)
Professor Spring’s group bridges biophysics, biomedical optics and cancer biology to selectively target micrometastases left behind by standard therapies that limit our ability to cure many cancers. Optical spectroscopic imaging and photophysics are applied to visualize and mop up these residual tumors. The ultimate goal of the program is to reduce cancer recurrence and mortality […]
  * ### [James Monaghan](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/james-monaghan/)
We aim to understand the cellular and molecular basis of tissue regeneration by studying the highly-regenerative axolotl salamander.
  * ### [Erin Cram](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/erin-cram/)
In 2020, Erin Cram was appointed Associate Dean for Research. As a member of the College Senior Leadership team, Dr. Cram provides creative, goal-oriented leadership for funding research-based initiatives, including PhD training. She also provides strategic planning for grant proposals, identifies funding and award opportunities, communicates success stories, and promotes entrepreneurship. Dr. Cram earned her […]
  * ### [Tovah Day](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/tovah-day/)
The Day Lab investigates the molecular role of G quadruplex DNA in genome stability and human disease. G quadruplexes are non-canonical DNA structures that form readily in repetitive, guanine-rich sequences. While they play an important role in normal cellular physiology, G quadruplexes also trigger genome instability and are associated with cancer. Our lab studies the […]
  * ### [Rebecca Shansky](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/rebecca-shansky/)
Research in Dr. Shansky’s lab focuses on the neural connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala, and sex differences in how this circuit processes fear and responds to stress. The mPFC and amygdala are frequently reported to be sites of dysfunction in stress-related mental illnesses like Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Post-Traumatic […]
  * ### [Sijia Dong](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/sijia-dong/)
Prof. Dong is passionate about accelerating science using computation and automation. She received her PhD in Chemistry from California Institute of Technology in 2017, advised by Prof. William A. Goddard III, with whom and Dr. Ravinder Abrol she developed a first-principles-based and data-driven computational method to predict the structures of proteins that are crucial drug […]
  * ### [Mary Jo Ondrechen](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/mary-jo-ondrechen/)
Mary Jo Ondrechen, PhD is professor of chemistry and chemical biology on the Boston campus of Northeastern University. She received an ACS certified bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from Reed College in Portland, OR and the PhD degree in Physical Chemistry / Chemical Physics from Northwestern University in Evanston, IL. Her research deals with understanding enzyme […]
