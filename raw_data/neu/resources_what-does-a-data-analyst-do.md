Organizations in all industries increasingly rely on data to make critical business decisions—which new products to develop, new markets to enter, new investments to make, and new (or existing) customers to target. They also use data to identify inefficiencies and other business problems that need to be addressed. 
In these organizations, the job of the data analyst is to assign a numerical value to these important business functions so performance can be assessed and compared over time. But the job involves more than just looking at numbers: An analyst also needs to know _how_ to use data to enable an organization to make more informed decisions. 
These roles are in high demand. Job openings for analysts are projected to [grow by 23% between 2021 and 2031](https://www.discoverdatascience.org/career-information/data-analyst/). Data analysts receive a median starting annual salary in the $108,000 range; however, success in the role can lead to senior positions with [salaries exceeding $137,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/data-analyst-salary-SRCH_KO0,12.htm).
If the role of a data analyst sounds like a good fit for you, here’s what you need to know.
## What is analytics?
[Analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-professional-studies-in-analytics-online-14942/) brings together theory and practice to identify and communicate data-driven insights that allow managers, stakeholders, and other executives in an organization to make more informed decisions. Experienced data analysts consider their work in a larger context, within their organization and in consideration of a wide range of external factors. Analysts are also able to account for the competitive environment, internal and external business interests, and the absence of certain datasets in the data-based recommendations that they make to stakeholders. 
A [Master of Professional Studies in Analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-professional-studies-in-analytics-online-14942/) prepares students for a [career as a data analyst ](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/why-pursue-data-analysis-career/)by covering the concepts of probability theory, statistical modeling, data visualization, predictive analytics, and risk management in the context of a business environment. In addition, a [master’s degree in analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/is-masters-in-analytics-worth-it/) equips students with the programming languages, database languages, and software programs that are vital to the day-to-day work of a data analyst.
## Types of data analytics
[Four types of data analytics](https://www.scnsoft.com/blog/4-types-of-data-analytics) build on each other to bring increasing value to an organization.
  * Descriptive analytics examines what happened in the past: monthly revenue, quarterly sales, yearly website traffic, and so on. These types of findings allow an organization to spot trends.
  * Diagnostic analytics considers why something happened by comparing descriptive datasets to identify dependencies and patterns. This helps an organization determine the cause of a positive or negative outcome.
  * [Predictive analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/predictive-analytics/) seeks to determine likely outcomes by detecting tendencies in descriptive and diagnostic analyses. This allows an organization to take proactive action—like reaching out to a customer who is unlikely to renew a contract, for example.
  * Prescriptive analytics attempts to identify what business action to take. While this type of analysis brings significant value in the ability to address potential problems or stay ahead of industry trends, it often requires the use of complex algorithms and advanced technology such as machine learning. 


## Key responsibilities of a data analyst
The answer to the question “What does a data analyst do?” will vary depending on the type of organization and the extent to which a business has adopted data-driven decision-making practices. Generally speaking, though, the tasks data analysts must perform on a daily basis include the following:
  * Designing and maintaining data systems and databases; this includes fixing coding errors and other data-related problems. 
  * Mining data from primary and secondary sources, then reorganizing the data in a format that can be easily read by either human or machine. 
  * Using statistical tools to interpret datasets, paying particular attention to trends and patterns that could be valuable for diagnostic and predictive analytics efforts.
  * Demonstrating the significance of their work in the context of local, national, and global trends that impact both their organization and industry.
  * Preparing reports for executive leadership that [effectively communicate trends, patterns, and predictions using relevant data](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/communicating-with-data/). 
  * Collaborating with programmers, engineers, and organizational leaders to identify opportunities for process improvements, recommend system modifications, and develop policies for data governance.
  * Creating appropriate documentation that allows stakeholders to understand the [steps of the data analysis process](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analysis-project-lifecycle/) and duplicate or replicate the analysis if necessary.


## What skills do you need to be a data analyst?
A successful data analyst possesses a combination of [technical skills](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analyst-skills/) and [leadership skills](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/top-5-leadership-qualities/).
Technical skills include knowledge of database languages such as SQL, R, or Python; spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets for statistical analysis; and data visualization software such as Tableau or Qlik. Mathematical and statistical skills are also valuable to help gather, measure, organize, and analyze data while using these common tools.

Leadership skills prepare a data analyst to complete decision-making and problem-solving tasks. These abilities allow analysts to think strategically about the information that will [help stakeholders make data-driven business decisions](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-driven-decision-making/) and to communicate the value of this information effectively. For example, project managers rely on data analysts to track the most important metrics for their projects, to diagnose problems that may be occurring, and to predict how different courses of action could address a problem.
## Data analysis vs. data science vs. business analysis
The difference in what a data analyst does as compared to a [business analyst](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analyst-vs-business-analyst/) or a [data scientist](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analytics-vs-data-science/) comes down to how the three roles use data.
  * The data analyst serves as a gatekeeper for an organization’s data so stakeholders can understand data and use it to make strategic business decisions. It is a technical role that requires an undergraduate degree or [master’s degree in analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-professional-studies-in-analytics-online-14942/), computer modeling, science, or math.
  * The business analyst serves in a strategic role focused on using the information that a data analyst uncovers to identify problems and propose solutions. These analysts typically earn a degree in a major such as business administration, economics, or finance. 
  * The data scientist takes the data visualizations created by data analysts a step further, sifting through the data to identify weaknesses, trends, or opportunities for an organization. [This role also requires a background in math or computer science](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analytics-vs-data-science/), along with some study or insight into human behavior to help make informed predictions.


At startups and other small organizations, it is not uncommon for a data analyst to take on some of the predictive modeling or decision-making responsibilities that may otherwise be assigned to a data scientist. 
## How much do data analysts make?
The average annual [salary of a data analyst](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-much-do-data-analysts-make/) can range from approximately $67,509 to $137,000, with some roles paying more than others depending on the city, industry, and specialization required of each one.

The data analyst role is also a natural stepping stone for more senior data-driven jobs within an analyst career. According to PayScale, data analysts move on to roles such as senior data analyst, data scientist, analytics manager, and business analyst. These roles come with substantial increases in pay, too. The average salary of data scientists is $100,588, while analytics managers make about $106,103 per year.
