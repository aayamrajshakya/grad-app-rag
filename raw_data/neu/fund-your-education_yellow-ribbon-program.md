## VA Education Benefits
  * **The Post 9/11 GI Bill® (Ch. 33)**


[The Post 9/11 GI Bill® ](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/)is a robust education program offered by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans and Servicemembers that have served at least 90 days total on Active Duty could be eligible for funding under the Post 9/11 GI Bill®. The amount of funding available to each beneficiary is determined by the total length of active-duty service.
To qualify for the maximum amounts, you must have served 36 months on active duty, received a Purple Heart on or after 9/11/2001, or you were discharged because of a service-connected disability.
Those that served less than 36 months will have all payments prorated by their eligibility tier:
  * 910 to 1,094 days (30 to 35 months): 90% of the full benefit
  * 730 to 909 days (24 to 29 months): 80% of the full benefit
  * 545 to 729 days (18 to 23 months): 70% of the full benefit
  * 180 to 544 days (6 to 17 months): 60% of the full benefit
  * 90 to 179 days (90 days to 5 months): 50% of the full benefit

  * ******Tuition and Fees******


The VA will pay the cost of required tuition and fee charges each term up to $28,937.09 in the 2024-2025 academic year. Tuition payments are made directly to Northeastern on your behalf.
  * If you are entitled to less than 100%, the payment for each term as well as the annual tuition cap will be prorated by your eligibility tier.
  * Northeastern is required to report the net tuition and fee charges to the Department of Veterans Affairs after applying all tuition-based scholarships, grants, waivers, or loans to your bill. Title IV funding such as the Pell Grant and unsubsidized loans are not considered to be tuition based and are not factored into the amount invoiced to the VA.

  * ******The Yellow Ribbon Program******


[The Yellow Ribbon Program](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/post-9-11/yellow-ribbon-program/) is a voluntary agreement between the Department of Veterans Affairs and Northeastern University that helps pay for tuition costs that exceed the annual tuition cap. We proudly participate at the highest level possible, offering a 50% scholarship for costs not covered to all eligible students, which the VA will match. This means that as long as you have remaining entitlement under the Post 9/11 GI Bill® at the 100% level, all required tuition and fees will be covered in full by the VA and Northeastern.
