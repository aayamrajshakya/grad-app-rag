Program overview 
##  Transform the learning landscape 
The Doctor of Education can be completed in three to four years. Students choose from five concentrations based on their interests and incorporate these interests into their dissertation in practice as well.
Students come from diverse disciplines and professions and gain a practical education that translates to their everyday working environments.
While all EdD courses can be completed online, annual in-person two-day residencies are held on campus. Residencies focus on tools for career success and allow you to connect with faculty and fellow scholars. You’ll attend residencies in your first and second years of the program at one of our campuses in Boston or Seattle.
This degree is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (NECHE).

EdD Program of the Year 
The Carnegie Project on the Education Doctorate selected Northeastern’s EdD program as the 2022-2023 Program of the Year, noting the “redesigned Dissertation in Practice Curriculum and the adoption of action research as its guiding methodology.” The committee praised “the program’s efforts to move beyond the typical five-chapter dissertation and engage scholarly practitioners in the acquisition of skills to realize meaningful change in their local contexts, emphasizing social justice.”
Dissertation in practice 
As you begin the program, you’ll also begin your dissertation in practice. After identifying your problem of practice, you’ll develop an action plan—incorporating cycles of data collection and analysis, collaboration, change work, and reflection—and culminate in the dissemination of your findings. A faculty advisor will support your research.
