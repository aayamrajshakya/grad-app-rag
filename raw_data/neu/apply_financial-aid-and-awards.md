## CSSH Graduate Fellowships, Assistantships and Scholarships
CSSH fellowships, assistantships, and scholarships are awarded to full-time degree candidates through the Graduate Office, at the recommendation of its departments.
Questions about CSSH assistantships and scholarships may be directed to the CSSH Graduate Office (gradcssh@northeastern.edu).
### Assistantships for Doctoral Degree Students
All admitted PhDs are awarded Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGA). These awards offer a stipend, tuition remission and the [NUSHP health plan](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/resource/health-plan/) to full-time students. Student fees, including the University Health and Counseling Services fee, are not covered by the assistantship. In order to maintain awards, students must be making satisfactory progress toward their degrees. More details about assistantships are included in the admissions offer letters. 
### The Experiential PhD 
The [experiential PhD](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/academics/the-experiential-phd/) gives doctoral students opportunities to collaborate with, and work in, arts and education organizations, local and state agencies, non-profits and businesses in the Boston area and beyond. Experiential Fellows and Summer Scholars receive the same benefits as the Stipended Graduate Assistantship. 
### Scholarships for Master’s Degree Students
