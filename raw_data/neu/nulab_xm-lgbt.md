# XM-LGBT
Example code from "XM-LGBT" by Abbie Levesque DeCamp.
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
XM<LGBT/> seeks to build a qualitative coding system that thinks more deeply about LGBTQ+ people and about queer theory, forefronting these methods and ways of thinking. This project began in 2016 as part of project lead Abbie Levesque’s Master’s thesis on LGBTQ+ writing center tutors. Using RELAX NG, XSLT, and XML, this project seeks to explore what it means for a tool to align with a queer methodology. One of Levesque’s goals was to “bridge the worlds of DH and Rhetoric and Composition.”
