The [master’s degree in criminology and criminal justice](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/ "Master's in Criminal Justice and Criminology at Northeastern") prepares students for professional and research careers in [criminal justice, criminology and related fields](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/articles/masters-criminology-vs-criminal-justice-difference/ "Master's in Criminal Justice vs Criminology: What's the Difference?") by applying multidisciplinary and comparative social science to understand, predict, and explain crime. The curriculum teaches theoretical principles and effective practices for developing and implementing evidence-based public policy. 
The program consists of four required courses and four electives, totaling 32 credit hours, which can be completed online, on campus, or in a combination of both modalities. Full-time students can complete the requirements for graduation in one year. The optional cooperative education experience adds six months of work experience and a two credit-hour course for a total of 34 credit hours.
Students may explore specialized interests by selecting up to two electives in other graduate programs at Northeastern. Taking more classes outside of the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice requires approval from the graduate program director. 
Learning Outcomes:
  * Demonstrate foundational knowledge of criminology and criminal justice theories
  * Develop an understanding for the causes of crime from an interdisciplinary perspective
  * Identify the criminal justice process and important issues confronting the administration of justice
  * Demonstrate an understanding of social research methods
  * Explain the use of quantitative techniques in social science for academic and public-sector applications
  * Understand the role of systemic racism and intersecting dimensions of oppression in the development of policies and practices across the criminal justice system, as well as in crime and justice theory and research
