#  BorisYelin
Associate Teaching Professor of Spanish and Portuguese; Academic Coordinator of the Portuguese Program 
Boris Yelin came to Northeastern University from Purdue University where he completed his MA and PhD in Spanish linguistics. He has taught all levels of Spanish, Latin American culture, beginning Portuguese and French, and various levels of English as a second language. He is also grateful to have had the opportunity to learn a variety of languages that help him with the growing international body of students.
His research on multilingualism and psycholinguistics helps him explore how the mind works when several languages are involved, as well as how to help students use their multiple languages or even their native languages to forge strong connections and unpack languages to promote more efficient learning. Boris is a big proponent of the communicative method and learning in context, but he also utilizes a variety of methods in order to account for individual differences in learners.
Before his graduate work, Boris received his BA in Spanish and political science with a minor in Latin American studies from the University of Louisville. During his undergraduate career he was able to participate in many international opportunities in Panama, Brazil, Spain, France, China, and the Philippines, which have given him a truly global perspective.
