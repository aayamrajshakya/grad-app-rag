# Programming Languages at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Advancing the understanding of how people harness the power of computing
Northeastern University’s programming languages group has made lasting contributions that span both the theory and practice of computing. Their work has established the mathematical foundations that define how programs behave and how programming errors can be prevented, while also producing widely used languages, compilers, and educational resources. Over the decades, they have helped standardize influential programming languages, authored widely used textbooks, and pioneered innovative teaching approaches that bring computer science concepts to learners of all ages. Today, the group’s research extends into areas like secure compilation, software verification, probabilistic programming, and AI-assisted programming.
