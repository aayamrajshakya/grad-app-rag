The Gerber Foundation has an interest in promoting the development of new investigators. Recognizing that many developing researchers may find it difficult to obtain initial funding to establish their line of investigation, a Novice Researcher program has been initiated. The purpose is to encourage the development of medical research in infant and early childhood health and nutrition by awarding small grants to new researchers.
These awards follow the Foundation’s current focus on clinical/translational research in infant and early childhood health and nutrition. Emphasis is placed on projects with relatively short clinical applicability.

1 year
Funding
Applications for Novice grants follow the same process as regular grants and are limited to no more than $30,000 in total (inclusive of indirects). They are identified by the amount requested in the application.
  * A maximum of $30,000 (inclusive of indirects) per project will be awarded under the Novice Researcher Award program.
  * Indirect costs are limited to no more than 10% of the total direct costs.
  * No more than ½ of the total budget may be applied to salary for the developing researcher (including fringe benefits).
  * The remainder of the funds are to be used for research-related expenses, including supplies.
  * The cost of attendance at one conference to report findings resulting from the project is allowed during the grant period. Travel costs for this conference may not exceed $2,000.


Eligibility
Eligible applicants include physicians, PhD candidates, PharmD candidates, and other similar degree candidates:
  * in a residency or fellowship training program or those who are no more than one year post training
  * have not received a K award from the National Institutes of Health
  * have an assigned mentor for the project and a current development plan


Applicants who hold or have received a K award from the National Institutes of Health are not eligible to apply to the Gerber Foundation under this program.
Projects need to be under the guidance of a mentor. The qualifications and experience of the mentor will be a consideration during evaluation of the application.
