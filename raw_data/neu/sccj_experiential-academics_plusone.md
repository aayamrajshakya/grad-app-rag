### Why might this be right for me?
  1. Professionals who enter the workforce with graduate level experience are often more competitive.
  2. The PlusOne option makes financial sense. The PlusOne program allows you to use open undergraduate electives to instead pursue graduate level coursework. By double counting up to 16 credits toward a bachelor’s and master’s degree, you essentially save 50% on your graduate education.
  3. The PlusOne Program can accelerate the completion of a graduate degree. Through proper planning, students complete a master’s in one year and sometimes in one semester.
