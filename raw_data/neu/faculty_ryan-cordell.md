#  RyanCordell
Affiliated Associate Professor of English 
Ryan Cordell is an Associate Professor in the School of Information Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in addition to an affiliated faculty member in the Department of English and a Core Founding Faculty Member in the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science. His scholarship seeks to illuminate how technologies of production, reception, circulation, and remediation shape the sociology of texts. Cordell primarily studies circulation and reprinting in nineteenth-century American newspapers, but his interests extend to the influence of computation and digitization of contemporary reading, writing, and research. Cordell collaborates with colleagues in English, History, and Computer Science on the Viral Texts project, which uses robust data mining tools to discover borrowed texts across large-scale archives of nineteenth-century periodicals. At Northeastern, Cordell was the founding director of the Huskiana Experiential Letterpress Studio. Cordell is also a Senior Fellow at the Andrew W. Mellon Society of Critical Bibliography at the Rare Book School and serves as the Delegate Assembly Representative for the MLA’s Forum on Digital Humanities.

## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Building a (Better) Book](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/honr/)
#### HONR 3310
In this studio-based course, students investigate intersections among media, literature, and computation in order to understand the history of the book and imagine its future. Students cultivate new technical skills that will enable them to effectively use a range of historical and contemporary textual technologies, including letterpress, binding, 3D printing, and interactive, online storytelling. Students use the skills they develop over the course of the semester to develop multimodal creative or research projects, building their own print-digital books. 
  * ###  [Reading and Writing in the Digital Age](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 1450
Grapples with the long and sometimes tumultuous relationship between literature—including fiction, poetry, film, and video games—and new media technologies. Offers students opportunities to historicize and engage the social and literary upheavals of our own technological moment through reading, discussion, writing projects, and practicums that seek to develop skills for analyzing the data and metadata of texts through both qualitative and quantitative methods. 


### [Technologies of Text ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 3340
Examines innovations that have reshaped how humans share information, e.g., the alphabet, the book, the printing press, the postal system, the computer. Focuses on debates over privacy, memory, intellectual property, and textual authority that have historically accompanied the rise of new media forms and genres. Offers students an opportunity to gain skills for working with texts using the rapidly changing tools of the present, e.g., geographic information systems, data mining, textual analysis.
