#  MatthewAlemu
Assistant Professor of Sociology and Criminology and Criminal Justice 
Matthew Alemu completed his PhD in the joint Sociology and Public Policy program at the University of Michigan. His research broadly examines how experiencing an absent father as a youth influences one’s life course. Specifically, his dissertation examined how growing up with an absent father informs young Black men’s ideologies and intentions for fatherhood and romantic relationships. Matthew Alemu completed his B.S. in Accounting at the Xavier University of Louisiana in New Orleans in 2006. Afterward, he received his MPP from the University of Michigan’s Ford School of Public Policy in 2009. Before beginning his doctoral studies, Matthew worked as a policy analyst at the Government Accountability Office. Matthew is also actively engaged in public scholarship on race, and his op-eds have been featured in the Detroit Free Press, BridgeDetroit, and Blavity.com.
