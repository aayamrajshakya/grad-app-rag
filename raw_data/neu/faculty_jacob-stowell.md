#  JacobStowell
Associate Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice 
Professor Jacob Stowell’s research interests are guided by two general themes: communities and crime. More specifically, he is interested in the variation in patterns of violence across immigrant and non-immigrant neighborhoods. Most recently, his research has involved the use of tract-level data collected for a number of U.S. cities to test the question of whether immigration is associated with high levels of lethal and non-lethal violence, as theories of crime expect. Professor Stowell is currently involved in additional research projects which examine both the spatial and temporal aspects of the immigrant/crime link. Professor Stowell’s methodological interests include mapping, spatial analysis and structural equation modeling. His teaching interests include statistics, research methods, and communities and crime.
