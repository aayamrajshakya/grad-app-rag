#  What is the difference between an MBA and a Master's in Management? 
Updated on: October 22, 2025
A [Master of Business Administration (MBA)](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/mba-full-time/) provides a broad understanding of business functions to prepare individuals for leadership roles in various industries. In contrast, an [MS in Management](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-management-boston/) focuses on refining leadership abilities, strategic thinking, and adaptability in today's fast-paced business environment. While both degrees share similarities and overlap in some areas, they have distinct focuses and are tailored to different career paths.
This guide explores the unique features, curriculum structures, and career opportunities each degree offers to help you make a well-informed decision based on your professional goals and aspirations.
## MBA vs. MS in Management: Choosing the right program for you
When deciding between an MBA and an MS in Management, consider your career goals and how you prefer to learn. An MBA gives you a wide-ranging understanding of business functions, perfect if you're aiming for leadership roles. Meanwhile, an MS in Management focuses on honing leadership skills, making it great for recent grads or those with less work experience.
Also, some universities offer a smooth transition from an MS in Management to an MBA. This means you can dive deep into and expand your horizons with broader business concepts. Plus, you can often apply credits from your MS program toward your MBA, making the whole process more efficient.
##  What is an MBA?
An [MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/graduate-programs/mba/) is a graduate-level business degree that offers a comprehensive understanding of various business management and administration aspects. It equips students with essential skills and knowledge in finance, marketing, operations, and leadership disciplines.
This program provides a broad foundation in business principles with the opportunity for specialization through concentrations or elective courses. MBA graduates are well-prepared to tackle complex business challenges, lead teams, and make strategic decisions in diverse organizational settings.
###  How long does it take to earn an MBA?
Full-time MBA programs can be completed in two years, and part-time programs can be completed in as little as three years. Some programs offer flexible timelines to meet students' needs.
###  What do you learn in an MBA program?
Coursework in an MBA program spans essential areas such as finance, marketing, operations, and strategic management. It provides a comprehensive understanding of business operations and develops critical analytical and problem-solving skills.
MBA programs offer concentrations, also known as specialties or majors, that allow you to specialize in areas like analytics, entrepreneurship, or international business. These concentrations provide opportunities to delve deeper into specific fields of interest, equipping you with focused knowledge and expertise to excel in your chosen career path.
###  What are the eligibility requirements for MBA programs?
Candidates applying for an MBA program typically need a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university. While work experience is not always a strict requirement, MBA candidates typically have several years of relevant professional experience. Eligibility requirements vary by school, so be sure to check the specific criteria of each program you are interested in.
###  Can you earn an MBA while still working?
Yes, many MBA programs offer flexible scheduling options that will allow you to work while pursuing your degree. These programs often include evening or part-time classes that accommodate professionals who are balancing work and study. Additionally, some MBA programs offer online or hybrid formats, further enhancing flexibility for working students.
Full-time students enrolled in MBA programs can also gain valuable experience and earn income by participating in internships or [corporate residencies](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/corporate-residency/). Look for programs with established corporate partnerships that enable students to work full-time at reputable companies or startups in their field while earning credits toward their degree. These experiences can last 3-, 6-, or up to 12-months depending on your goals.
###  Can I earn an MBA if I already have a master's degree?
Yes, earning an MBA is possible if you've already completed a master's degree. Some schools allow students with master's degrees to apply credits from previous programs toward an MBA. After applying these credits and gaining admission, students can finish the remaining coursework to earn their MBA. In fact, some students start with an MS in Management to gain the skills they need earlier in their career and later earn an MBA as their career progresses.
Additionally, certain institutions provide financial incentives for pursuing a second advanced degree from the same school. For instance, graduate alumni admitted to an MBA program may qualify for [discounts](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-financial-aid/scholarships/double-husky-scholarship/) that reduce tuition fees.
