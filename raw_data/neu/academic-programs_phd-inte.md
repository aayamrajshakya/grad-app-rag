## Overview
The College of Engineering offers an interdisciplinary engineering Doctor of Philosophy degree involving substantial work in two or more academic departments or disciplines. This is an individually designed program for the student who wishes to pursue graduate studies in an area that substantially overlaps two or more units. In such cases, that student may design, in consultation with their faculty advisor(s), an interdisciplinary program. The program will correspond in scope and depth to Northeastern University’s established degree standards but need not agree exactly with the regulations of individual units. Individually designed interdisciplinary degree programs must be approved by the appropriate graduate office(s).

## Curriculum
In order to pursue an individually designed interdisciplinary engineering graduate program, a student must have been accepted into an approved graduate program that will serve as the administrative home unit for the interdisciplinary engineering program.
The interdisciplinary engineering program admits applicants into the PhD program either directly after earning a suitable bachelor’s degree (i.e., direct entry) or after earning a suitable master’s degree (i.e., advanced entry). Upon acceptance into the program, an applicant is designated as a doctoral student. This designation is changed to doctoral candidate upon successful completion of the doctoral qualifying requirements as well as all the required coursework.
#### Learning Outcomes
The Interdisciplinary Engineering PhD programs’ student learning outcomes are:
  * An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems
  * An ability to explain and apply engineering design principles, as appropriate to the program’s educational objectives
  * An ability to produce solutions that meet specified end-user needs with consideration of economic factors, and, where relevant, factors related to public policy, safety, and the environment

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges including industry experience as part of the co-op program or an internship. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a Co-op Program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum. Northeastern has over 3,000 co-op employer partners in a wide variety of organizations, from large companies to entrepreneurial start-ups. Students can also participate in the university’s [Experiential PhD program](https://phd.northeastern.edu/network/experientialphd/).
