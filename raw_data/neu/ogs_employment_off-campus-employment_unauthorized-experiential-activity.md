#  Students Studying in The United States 
In order to maintain your F-1 student status, please review these guidelines regarding unauthorized employment on Curricular Practical Training (CPT). 
##  Unauthorized Employment 
Students cannot start employment/experiential activities outside the classroom without first obtaining appropriate employment authorization from OGS (Curricular Practical Training (CPT), Pre-Completion Optional Practical Training (Pre-OPT), Academic Training (AT), etc.). Unauthorized experiential activity where CPT/Pre-OPT/AT is required and not obtained will place the student in serious violation of their F-1 or J-1 status and may result in their SEVIS record termination.
Students must contact OGS for an appointment if they have questions about what qualifies as unauthorized activity, or if they believe they have engaged in unauthorized experiential activities where employment authorization is required. Please call our office at +1-617-373-2310 or stop by 354 Richards Hall in Boston to schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official/DSO (F-1 Students) or Alternate Responsible Officer/ARO (J-1 Students).
