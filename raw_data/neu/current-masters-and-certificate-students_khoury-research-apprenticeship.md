## About the Khoury Research Apprenticeship opportunity
Started in 2019, the prestigious Khoury Research Apprenticeship is designed to provide current master’s students the opportunity to participate in relevant research opportunities while being mentored and supported by faculty advisors. The program, held in the fall and spring semesters, is an excellent way to explore your current research interests or help to pave a pathway to a future PhD when you complete your master’s.
## Nomination process
Current faculty are encouraged to nominate students who they feel demonstrate both strong academic skills and have presented an outstanding affinity and talent for research. During this nomination process, faculty are asked to present proposals for research projects that apprenticeship recipients can participate in. Academic advisors are also welcomed to nominate students they feel could be good candidates for the apprenticeship, or who have expressed an interest in becoming involved in research or continuing to Khoury College’s PhD program.
Once nominated, students can apply to the projects that they’re interested in and will be interviewed by the corresponding faculty sponsors. A committee will review the faculty selections and the students’ chosen interest to determine final assignments.
> The apprenticeship program played a big role in my decision to pursue a PhD. When I was nominated for the apprenticeship program, I neither had any prior research experience, nor did I intend on pursuing a PhD. The program gave me an opportunity to be involved in research in academia and interact with fellow grad students and faculty members
> Satyajit Gokhale, computer science PhD student
## If you’re awarded an apprenticeship
Students who are awarded apprenticeships will register for the four-credit master’s course, funded by Khoury College, to begin their research work. At the end of the apprenticeship, students will have the opportunity to present their work to an audience of peers and faculty and highlight their findings.
