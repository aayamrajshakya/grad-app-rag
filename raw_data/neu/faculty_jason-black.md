## Biography
Technology and communications professional with proven experience in systems development and team leadership for Web and digital marketing, enterprise systems, external relations, and information security. Over the last 20 years, I’ve held senior-level technology and marketing communications positions in higher education. An advocate for lifelong learning in myself and for others I approach each day in the classroom with authenticity, commitment, and enthusiasm. It is an rewarding privilege to have the opportunity to share my knowledge and experience through the teaching of undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in the ITC program at Northeastern.
My professional interests outside of the classroom include cyber-security, e-Learning, open source technology, digital storytelling, and experiential learning. A frequent presenter to academic conferences and an occasional writer outside of the classroom, I am presently compiling material for a book publication on technology in education for Winter 2021.
I hold a Master’s of Science in Information Systems from Salve Regina University and a Bachelor’s of Arts in Communications from Roger Williams University.
