### How Northeastern’s Curriculum Provides Flexibility
#### 1. Easy Application Process
[Northeastern’s Online Master of Science in Data Analytics Engineering program](https://online.northeastern.edu/engineering/ms-data-analytics-engineering/) offers a straightforward and accessible application process for busy professionals who want to take the first step toward advancing their careers. The process, which takes 5 minutes and can be completed on a mobile device, allows applicants to submit their materials with ease.
Northeastern’s fast app includes an application form and proof of a bachelor’s degree—no resume, test scores, or statement of purpose needed. This is essential to removing common barriers of prospective students from diverse educational or professional backgrounds.
To make the process even smoother, Northeastern provides dedicated admissions advisors who are available to support applicants every step of the way. These advisors offer personalized guidance, helping candidates understand requirements, submit materials on time, and navigate any challenges that arise during the process. This hands-on support ensures a stress-free experience for all prospective students.
#### 2. Flexible Learning Options
Northeastern’s program is tailored for busy professionals, offering an entirely online structure that prioritizes flexibility. For those balancing careers, family, and other commitments, the program’s asynchronous format ensures learning can fit seamlessly into any schedule.
> “The program is designed so that you can complete it when it works best for you,” Freedman notes. “Weekly modules and consistent deadlines provide the structure professionals need, while still allowing you to work at your own pace.”  
> 
This flexibility allows students to study when it’s most convenient for them—whether that means early mornings before work, late evenings, or even weekends. “For those who prefer a more interactive experience, faculty and teaching assistants hold office hours during evenings and weekends,” Freedman adds.
In addition to asynchronous learning options, this program also offers part-time enrollment for working professionals. “The program is designed so students can take one or two courses per semester,” Freedman notes. “If work gets busy in the spring, you can reduce your course load to one class. If you need to take the summer off, that’s okay. You can rejoin us in the fall without falling behind and your dedicated Success Manager can assist you in mapping out your individual plan.”
#### 3. Curriculum Designed for Non-Technical Professionals
[Northeastern’s Online Data Analytics Engineering program](https://online.northeastern.edu/engineering/ms-data-analytics-engineering/) stands out for its inclusive curriculum, designed to help non-technical professionals build essential skills from the ground up. By focusing on foundational knowledge and gradually introducing advanced concepts, the program ensures learners from diverse backgrounds can thrive.
> “This curriculum wasn’t adapted for non-technical learners,” Freedman notes. “It was built with them in mind. We wanted to create a program that provides technical expertise while remaining accessible to those without prior experience.”
The program begins with three foundational courses:
  *     * **Foundations for Data Analytics Engineering:** Introduces core concepts and tools in data analytics.
    * **Data Management for Analytics:** Focuses on organizing and preparing data for analysis.
    * **Computation and Visualization for Analytics:** Teaches students how to process and visualize data effectively.  



“These initial courses ensure that all learners, regardless of background, have the same solid foundation,” Freedman adds. “From there, students can choose electives tailored to their career goals, whether they want to specialize as a data analyst, engineer, or scientist.”
By structuring the curriculum this way, the program gradually introduces complex topics, allowing students to build confidence as they progress. This step-by-step approach, combined with a supportive cohort model, creates a collaborative learning environment that helps learners succeed.
#### 4. Personalized Support Systems
At Northeastern, personalized support is at the heart of all its programs. From the moment students apply to the day they graduate, they benefit from a robust system of faculty guidance, student success initiatives, and peer connections designed to help them thrive.
“Each student has a dedicated success manager who serves as their main point of contact throughout their journey,” Freedman points out. “From onboarding sessions to one-on-one meetings, we’re here to guide them every step of the way.”
In addition to success managers, faculty and teaching assistants provide consistent support through weekly office hours. These sessions are scheduled during evenings and weekends to accommodate busy professionals, ensuring that students can access help when they need it most. For those who prefer a collaborative learning environment, a Slack channel fosters community and connection among students, creating opportunities to share insights and tackle challenges together.
Northeastern also offers unique in-person meetups across its global campuses, providing an option for students who want to network and engage face-to-face. According to Freedman, these events complement the online learning experience and give students the opportunity to connect with peers and faculty while exploring relevant topics—like AI in healthcare.
#### 5. Hands-On Learning for Practical Skill Development
A hallmark of Northeastern is its emphasis on [experiential learning](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/knowledge-hub/what-is-experiential-learning/). Recognizing the importance of applying theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios, the data analytics engineering program offers opportunities for students to develop practical skills in a supportive, low-risk environment.
> “Our faculty intentionally incorporate real-world datasets into coursework,” Freedman says. “So students are solving problems that directly mirror challenges faced by professionals in the field. This gives learners the confidence to apply their skills outside the classroom.”
In addition to classroom projects, Northeastern is piloting an Experiential Learning Expo Course. As part of this elective, students collaborate on a 14-week project for a real employer, gaining hands-on experience that is directly applicable to their careers. “This initiative would allow students to tackle real industry problems while earning credit, giving them a tangible project to showcase to future employers,” she adds.
The program also fosters connections to industry through alumni speakers, employer information sessions, and Northeastern’s extensive career resources. These initiatives ensure students are not only gaining technical skills but also building professional networks that can support their long-term success.
