Additionally, job growth for product managers is expected to be similar to managing occupations, with a growth rate of 8% between 2019-2029, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Product managers are the fourth highest in-demand job in Silicon Valley, and Boston is a high-tech hub of innovation.
Experience-driven learning 
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. The cooperative education program, also known as co-op, is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain professional industry experience in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum while employed from four to eight months in a wide variety of organizations, from large companies to entrepreneurial startups.
You will have the opportunity to participate in the Sherman Center for Engineering Entrepreneurship Education co-op program, working on a venture for your co-op experience as part of the academic curriculum or to work in industry in a product development role.
In 2019, the Graduate School of Engineering placed nearly 1000 students in co-op positions. The College of Engineering has more than 2,000 co-op employer partners. We have a team that prepares students for the cooperative education experience through resumé building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development.
