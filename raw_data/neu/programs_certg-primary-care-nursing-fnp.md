Program overview 
##  Training family nurse practitioners 
The Bouvé College of Health Sciences’ Graduate Certificate in Family Nurse Practitioner program prepares you to become nationally certified as a family nurse practitioner by the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN) or the American Association of Nurse Practitioners (AANP).
The program is designed for advanced practice registered nurses (APRN) currently holding a master’s degree (MS or MSN) and a certification in another APRN specialty. The curriculum focuses on the expertise required to take the National Family Nurse Practitioner Certification Examination from the American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) or the AANP.
Course offerings and clinical practicum requirements are individualized, and credit requirements range from 19 to 29 based on previous specialty certification.

Program features 
  * The online curriculum allows you to continue working as you earn your graduate certificate.
  * Course offerings and clinical practicum requirements are individualized based on previously earned certifications.
  * The Bouvé College School of Nursing prepares you for national certification exams in your area of practice through personalized problem-solving experiences in and out of the classroom.

  * All students gain clinical experience in women’s health, pediatrics, and adult gerontology.
  * Clinical hours can be completed locally or in the Boston area.


Career outlook 
  * The United States is facing a shortage of primary care physicians, leading to a surging demand for family nurse practitioners nationally. Looking toward 2034, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) foresees a shortage of up to 124,000 physicians.
  * The Bureau of Labor Statistics (2023) estimates an opening of 29,200 positions for advanced practice nurses annually through 2032. The bureau also reported a median salary of $125,900 for advanced practice nurses in 2022.
  * Other factors that support the rising need for advanced practice nurses include an aging population, greater funding for preventive care, significant loss of primary care providers in rural areas, and a lack of providers in underserved communities.
