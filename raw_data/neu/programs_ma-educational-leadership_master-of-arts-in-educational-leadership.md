Program benefits 
  * In-person, academically rigorous program
  * Most classes meet once weekly, per semester, in the evenings to accommodate full-time work schedules
  * Join a network of 21 Bay Area school districts
  * Meet standards for the PASC while attaining mastery of the California Administrator Performance Expectations ([CAPE](https://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com/content/docs/CAPE_Placemat.pdf)) competencies
  * Achieve readiness to submit the [CalAPA exam](https://www.ctcexams.nesinc.com/TestView.aspx?f=HTML_FRAG/CalAPA_TestPage.html) assessment to outside reviewers during the final two semesters of the program


Career outlook 
Graduates of the program are employed in 21 Bay Area school districts, including those in the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that California is the state with the fifth highest annual mean wage for kindergarten through secondary administrators, at $128,280 (US Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2022). California elementary teachers earn an annual mean wage of $86,470, middle school teachers earn $92,350, high school teachers receive $94,600, and early childhood special education teachers earn $78,310 (BLS, 2022). For teachers seeking opportunities to earn a higher salary while working in a school-based position, continuing their education in an Administrative Services Credential program to secure employment as an administrator can significantly increase their wages.
Learning approach 
The MA in Educational Leadership program emphasizes both developmental and constructivist approaches to education. School leaders learn to test theory in practice, anticipate consequences, and evaluate outcomes in a wide range of educational settings. Graduates have a strong record of becoming successful school administrators and leaders in educational transformation and school leadership. Graduates of the program are employed in 21 Bay Area school districts, including those in the following counties: Alameda, Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara. In this credential-based program, students earn both a master’s degree in educational leadership as well as a PASC credential. After earning the PASC, students may continue on toward a Clear credential, which certifies them to maintain employment as school administrators in California’s K–12 public school system beyond the five-year preliminary credential.
The curricula and pedagogy for the MA in Educational Leadership program is firmly rooted in praxis—combining both research and practice. Candidates are required to construct models of leadership that they can apply to real-life situations. The goal of the program is to develop reflective practitioners and thinkers. Application of theories, identification of concepts, and review of current research literature and exploration of documented experience with comparable problems will be part of the course content and field experiences that make up the program.
From the beginning of their coursework, through the completion of their final field experience, candidates continually work to clarify and deepen their educational philosophy and sharpen their educational vision. To develop a philosophy of education and a vision of excellence, they will, through their courses and field experiences, read and understand contending philosophies and theories of education. Adult learning will be addressed through andragogy, a term used to clarify the curriculum development needs of adults. The MA in Educational Leadership program identifies the need for adults to be motivated to learn, to be active in the learning process, and to have the opportunity to integrate their past experiences with their present learning. The MA in Educational Leadership program will integrate California Administrator Performance Expectations competencies into the program in two field experience seminars, where students can practice their leadership while demonstrating mastery of CAPE standards.
