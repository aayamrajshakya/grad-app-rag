Mechanical engineers design, develop, and support the manufacture of machinery and devices to transmit power or to convert energy from thermal to mechanical form in order to power the modern world and its machines. Traditionally, mechanical engineers have designed and tested devices such as heating and air-conditioning systems, machine tools, internal combustion engines, and steam power plants. Today, they also play primary roles in the development of new technologies in a variety of fields—energy conversion, solar energy utilization, environmental control, prosthetics, transportation, manufacturing, robotics, and new-materials development.
Industrial engineers design and analyze systems that include people, equipment, and materials and their interactions and performance in the workplace. An industrial engineer collects this information and evaluates alternatives to make decisions that best advance the goals of the enterprise. They leverage data analytics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and simulation technologies to optimize complex systems and drive evidence-based decision making. Industrial engineers work in manufacturing firms, hospitals, banks, public sectors, government agencies, and service industries. They also increasingly find roles in technology companies, e-commerce platforms, and consulting firms specializing in digital transformation. Among the projects they undertake are design and implementation of a computer-integrated supply chain or manufacturing system, facilities planning for a variety of industries, design of a robotics system in a manufacturing environment, long-range corporate planning, development and implementation of a quality-control system, simulation analyses to improve processes and make operational decisions, healthcare operations design to enhance patient safety and improve efficiency, productivity, and development of computer systems for information control. Additional emerging areas include implementation of Internet of Things networks for real-time monitoring and control, development of predictive maintenance algorithms to prevent equipment failure, creation of digital twins for virtual system optimization, application of sustainable engineering principles to reduce environmental impact, design of human-AI collaborative workspaces, and utilization of Big Data analytics to identify patterns and trends that drive continuous improvement.
