## This concentration is ideal for
MBA students interested in the potential of extended reality technologies 
Emerging leaders interested in jobs like XR product manager or UX strategist 
Students pursuing careers that leverage immersive technologies 
## Create immersive connections and experiences
As the technology that powers extended realities continues to advance, so do its uses and applications across industries and organizations—from entertainment and gaming to healthcare, education, and beyond. Organizations need forward-thinking professionals who want to lead and innovate at the intersection of business and immersive technologies. 
Our innovative MBA x Extended Realities concentration, offered in partnership with [Northeastern's College of Arts, Media and Design](https://camd.northeastern.edu/) (CAMD) will equip you with a foundation in this rapidly advancing field. With courses taught by CAMD faculty, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the history, impact, and uses of these technologies and choose electives based on your unique goals—whether you want to design XR experiences or develop the technologies that drive this industry forward. Build the skills you need to capitalize on strategic opportunities in the marketplace and make significant contributions to XR teams in both fast-paced startups and major enterprises. 
You don't need a background in extended realities. This concentration is open to anyone interested in creating immersive experiences.
