#  Bachelor of Arts International Affairs
The International Affairs interdisciplinary curriculum exposes students to courses in various disciplines while also giving students flexibility to select the courses and disciplines that interest them most. 
Students who graduate with their degree in international affairs go on to work in a variety of fields — non-profit organizations, NGOs, positions in the government, banks, media and communications, research, public relations, education, corporate companies, and many others. IAF alumni currently hold positions in the U.S. Government, Peace Corps, United Nations, Amnesty International, the Smithsonian, Mass General Hospital, and Harvard University.

Learning Outcomes
College of Social Sciences and Humanities, Northeastern University
International Affairs Program
Bachelor of Arts in International Affairs
The International Affairs program has identified 5 learning outcomes, which we consider essential to our International Affairs majors, and which form the backbone of our full curriculum review and revision process every five years. These are:
  1. Explain global affairs and international issues since the early 20th century through diverse and cross-disciplinary theories of: (1) Interstate relations: conflict, cooperation, hierarchies; (2) Civil society, transnational advocacy networks, global social movements; and (3) State-society relations: democracy, authoritarianism, inequalities, citizenship.
  2. Apply skills gained in coursework, such as language proficiency, cultural competence, and regional expertise, in new and authentic contexts, including Dialogues of Civilization, co-ops, internships, and/or study abroad.
  3. Develop research skills by writing a research paper that has: (1) posed research questions based on appropriate primary and secondary sources and; (2) applied and interpreted data to draw conclusions.
  4. Critically analyze and compare: (1) relevant texts and other media and; (2) evidence, arguments, and competing paradigms/theories.
  5. Challenge assumptions and values that underlie claims about international affairs (the interstate system, state-society relations, civil society, cultures and human rights, etc.).
