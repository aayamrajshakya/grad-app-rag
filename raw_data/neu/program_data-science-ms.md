Boston campus concentrations 
##  Boston campus concentrations 
If you choose to complete the MSDS on our Boston campus, you’ll have the opportunity to select between concentrations with Khoury College or the College of Engineering. Both share the same core courses — data management, programming, algorithms, and machine learning but they apply those skills differently through later courses.
Computer science concentration (Khoury College)
Build the systems behind real-world applications. You might create AI models that tag medical images to help doctors catch diseases or develop recommendation engines for streaming services. Cloud computing and distributed systems courses show you how to design platforms that handle millions of users — think social media or large e-commerce sites — while database classes teach you to organize and search massive datasets. Human–computer interaction ensures you can build intuitive interfaces, like mobile apps or dashboards.
Engineering concentration (College of Engineering)
In contrast, the engineering concentration uses similar techniques to solve practical problems in fields such as bioengineering, chemical processing, or civil infrastructure — optimizing water systems or modeling disease spread, for example.
These concentrations are available only at the Boston location; your degree will be awarded by the college that is home to your chosen concentration.
