## This concentration is ideal for
Students interested in branding and digital marketing 
Emerging leaders interested in jobs like brand manager or brand strategist 
Students looking to become future-focused, digitally-savvy brand managers 
## Become a strategic and creative brand leader 
Brand managers are the driving force behind brand loyalty—ensuring brand integrity across marketing efforts, evaluating trends to identify opportunities, managing teams and budgets, and overseeing campaigns and product launches. This role requires a range of skills—technical savvy, creative problem solving, interpersonal relationships, strategic thinking—which means that brand managers are typically well-respected and well-paid within an organization. 
Start with a foundational course designing and testing a strategic brand plan for a local organization, gaining hands-on experience in market trends, campaign execution, and performance measurement. Then, choose electives like Marketing Research, New Product Development, Managing Customer Engagement, Consumer Behavior, and Driving Marketing Performance. These courses help you develop skills tailored to your goals, building both depth and breadth as a brand manager. 
## Course requirements
The Brand Management concentration prepares you with the key tools and approaches of brand management, as well as the strategic thinking, creative problem-solving, and relationship-building skills you'll need for brand leadership roles. Coursework varies by program of interest. See the full list of required and elective courses in Northeastern's [Academic Catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/business/).

> “I chose a concentration in brand management to continue my interest in psychology and a concentration in entrepreneurship to align with my goal of being a successful business owner. I see myself as a strategist, a creative, and a storyteller, so branding and marketing were the perfect fit.”
