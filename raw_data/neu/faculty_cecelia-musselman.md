Cecelia A. Musselman is Teaching Professor in the Writing Program. She has been teaching with Wikipedia since 2006 and is an active member of the Boston-based Working Wikipedia Collaborative group of instructors and researchers. Her doctoral work was in Uralic Studies with a special focus on the history of the Finnish language. Her current research examines what happens when students contributions to Wikipedia and become knowledge makers with a global audience.

“Bridging the gap between science and communication is very important, but scientists rarely communicate their work effectively enough for a broad audience to understand. That’s the principle that underpins an unusual task Cecelia Musselman assigns to students in her ‘Advanced Writing for the Sciences’ course.”
