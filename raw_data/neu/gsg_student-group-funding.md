### A Legacy of Leadership and Advocacy
This year, the Graduate Student Government (GSG) at Northeastern University celebrates decades of advocacy, leadership, and dedication to enhancing the graduate student experience. Since its founding in 1992, GSG has grown into a powerful voice for over 18,000 graduate students, championing their needs and fostering a vibrant, inclusive community across all colleges and campuses.
Our journey began with the formation of the Graduate Student Association (GSA) to address the lack of representation for graduate students. Over the years, GSG has evolved and achieved numerous milestones, leaving a lasting impact on graduate student life at Northeastern.
