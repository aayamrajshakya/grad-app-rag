[1.2 million violent crimes and 6.9 million property crimes](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/home) occurred in the U.S. in 2019, and these numbers likely undercount the true prevalence of criminal behavior, which is not always reported to law enforcement. By digging into the details behind these figures, researchers examine the reasons for crimes, the long-term effects on victims, and the challenges that police and policymakers must confront.
The disciplines of criminology and criminal justice offer interconnected perspectives that can unlock valuable insights, resulting in safer and fairer communities. This article will explore the distinctions between these interrelated areas of study as well as the ways they complement one another. You will learn how pursuing a [master’s degree in criminal justice or criminology](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/ "Master’s degree in criminal justice or criminology from NEU") can offer you the opportunity to lead improvements in public policy, community outreach, and law enforcement. We will also discuss the advantages of [a well-rounded, multidisciplinary program](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/articles/masters-criminology-vs-criminal-justice-difference/#understanding-of-crime) that features skills and concepts from both criminology and criminal justice.

## What Is Criminal Justice?
Criminal justice focuses on studying the institutions involved in crime prevention, law enforcement, and corrections and driving evidence-based crime policy. These professionals may hold careers in federal law enforcement, cybersecurity, intelligence, victim advocacy, and fraud investigation. Research in this area highlights the strategies that most effectively promote public safety and reveal practices that may enable inequality, injustice, and abuses of power. 
For example, [Professor Jack McDevitt and Professor Amy Farrell](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/faculty/ "Faculty in Northeastern’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice") at the Institute on Race and Justice in the School of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Northeastern University have worked with police departments to conduct a series of studies on racial profiling and other inequalities within the justice system. McDevitt and Farrell [gathered two years of data on traffic and pedestrian stops](https://douglascountyks.org/depts/administration/county-news/2020/05/12/researchers-share-data-traffic-pedestrian-stop-study) in Kansas, looking for signs of systemic bias that indicate a need for policy changes.
Learning more about law enforcement policies and practices can pave the way for a variety of policy improvements within departments and agencies. Distinguished Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice Anthony M. Braga led an initiative from Northeastern University’s Center on Crime and Community Resilience that trained police departments in procedural justice. This approach strives to build trust through treating the members of a community with dignity, listening to them respectfully, and maintaining neutrality when making decisions.

## What Is Criminology?
Criminology is an integrative academic discipline that draws upon insights from other social and hard sciences (including psychology, political science, public policy, and economics) to analyze the underlying factors of illegal activities and criminals themselves. Criminology scholars delve into questions about where, when, and why crimes occur, as well as the consequences of crime for individuals, social groups, and communities. Their research may explore specific types of illicit acts like human trafficking or the [sale of counterfeit pharmaceuticals](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/counterfeit-medicine) that fail to meet medical standards. 
The discipline encompasses fields such as victimology, which concentrates on the psychological effects that victims experience as well as their relationships with offenders and the [criminal justice system](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/articles/advocating-social-justice-in-criminal-justice/). Criminology professionals use their research and statistical skills to better understand the diverse set of factors involved in crime. They serve as academic leaders, analysts in law enforcement agencies, and as research directors in correctional organizations.

## A Master’s in Criminal Justice vs. Criminology
Despite obvious overlap between criminology and criminal justice, there are important differences to consider when looking to start or specialize in a career in these industries. 
  * Students who earn a master’s in criminal justice may study different issues and pursue alternate career paths from those working toward a criminology degree.
  * Criminology curricula tend to emphasize the research and statistical skills that help students build a deeper understanding of the individual, social, economic, and psychological factors involved in interpersonal violence and property crime. Courses may examine theories of place to understand how the relationships in a community either enable or prevent illicit behavior.
  * Criminal justice master’s programs lean toward providing an extensive grounding in the theoretical underpinnings and the practical functions of policing, courts, and prisons, allowing students to learn how these systems affect the lives of individuals, their families, and their communities. These programs also focus on ways to implement more effective practices for reform.

## A Multidisciplinary Understanding of Crime
Students and professionals who are interested in starting or advancing in roles that address illegal behavior don’t have to choose between the two disciplines as they can benefit from a [criminology and criminal justice master’s degree program](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/ "MS in Criminology and Criminal Justice"). This program prepares students for a broad range of roles, but it can also allow them to gain a multifaceted perspective on the issues that are most relevant to a specific career path. Students develop skills in research design, data analysis, and qualitative inquiry, which lay the foundation for evidence-based policies, community engagement, and policing.
A master’s in criminal justice and criminology [curriculum](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/curriculum/ "Curriculum MS in Criminology and Criminal Justice") builds knowledge in topics such as:
  * Psychological and social scientific explanations for the causes of criminal activity and the impact on victims
  * Rooting out corruption and supporting greater accountability in law enforcement
  * Understanding how race, ethnicity, and gender affect the treatment of individuals in the justice system and society more broadly
  * Mapping incidents to uncover crime patterns and formulate community-based mitigation strategies
  * Stopping online fraud, identity theft, data breaches, and other cybercrimes
  * The causes of criminal violence on an individual, group, and societal level
  * Best practices for performing research and conducting evaluations
  * The social, economic, and psychological effects of incarceration
  * Identifying and protecting victims of human trafficking
  * International crime and policing in a globalized world
  * Drug addiction and initiatives to assist recovery


Professionals who grapple with the enormity of crime, its causes, and its consequences need expertise that is backed by rigorous research and practical experience. [Northeastern University’s Master of Science in Criminology and Criminal Justice program](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/ms-in-criminology-and-criminal-justice/ "MSCJ") engages with the full breadth of criminological inquiry and the criminal justice system, while providing specialized knowledge in fields ranging from cybersecurity to juvenile law. Bridging the gap between the disciplines of criminology and criminal justice can result in a more nuanced understanding of why illegal acts occur, what law enforcement and other agencies can do to promote positive societal change, and how professionals can contribute to a future that is safer and more equitable.
