#  Semester conversion for CPS graduate programs 
Find the information and resources you need to navigate the upcoming transition from a quarter-based academic calendar to a semester-based structure.
##  Understanding semester conversion 
The College of Professional Studies is excited to announce that beginning fall 2026, all master’s, graduate certificate, and doctoral programs will transition to a semester-based academic calendar.
This shift will bring significant benefits and better align our programs with the Northeastern Academic Plan while maintaining the highest academic excellence and student success standards.

Why the change? 
The shift to a semester-based calendar is designed to:
  * Enhance academic flexibility and align with industry standards, allowing for deeper learning experiences.
  * Facilitate interdisciplinary learning by enabling curriculum partnerships across Northeastern colleges and expanding co-op and experiential opportunities for students.
  * Improve program continuity with seamless integration across Northeastern programs and global university partners.
  * Support student success by offering longer class durations for more in-depth exploration of topics.


Key dates 
All CPS graduate programs will be converted to a semester-based calendar effective fall 2026.
What does this mean for you? 
If you enroll prior to fall 2026, this change will not impact your academic progress or delay your path to graduation, nor will the conversion to a semester calendar impact the total tuition of the program.
You will not encounter additional program costs aside from standard annual tuition and fee increases if you follow your semester plan and complete all requirements for your enrolled major and concentration. If you change your major or concentration after receiving your semester plan, you may incur extra program costs due to additional course requirements.
Your academic advisor will provide personalized guidance to ensure a smooth transition. Quarter credits will be converted to semester credits using a standard equivalency. Transition pathways are in place to keep you on track toward graduation.
