## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Engineering Business is part of the Galante Engineering Business Program. The Galante Engineering Business Program offers a progressive opportunity for engineering students to complement their technical engineering education with business skills.
The certificate seeks to provide students opportunities to apply the technical aspects of an engineering skill foundation in corporate settings through both academic and programmatic elements. Programmatic elements include workshops, speaker series, site visits, seminars, and other related personal and professional development activities as a connected cohort. These activities equip students to manage projects, lead people, make data-driven and market-based decisions, and advance economically sound initiatives.
The Galante Engineering Business Program can be completed concurrently with the following degree programs:
  * [MSBioE Bioengineering with Concentration in Biomedical Devices and Bioimaging](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/bioengineering/bioengineering-msbioe/#text) (Boston)
