## Overview
The Master of Science (MS) in Chemical Engineering at Northeastern University offers three concentrations to prepare students with knowledge and skills that align with their career interests. Students can pursue research with the general principles and applications concentration, or topical areas with the course-based concentrations in biosystems or sustainability that integrate chemical engineering knowledge with systems applications for industry. Additionally, a common computational-based core curriculum gives students important real-world mathematical tools, while experience through research opportunities or our industry-leading cooperative education program provides a competitive edge.

## Innovative Curriculum - MS in Chemical Engineering
The MS in Chemical Engineering is normally pursued by students with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering or closely allied fields. Students wishing to pursue the master’s degree but with undergraduate educational backgrounds other than chemical engineering may be required to complete supplementary undergraduate course work. These courses are in addition to the minimum course requirements.

Toggle Accordion  Extensive Research Opportunities 
With a premier location in downtown Boston, research in the department leverages the wealth of collaborations with neighboring universities, hospitals, medical centers and industry.
The department’s [research areas](https://che.northeastern.edu/coe-research/) include:
  * Biomolecular and Biomedical Systems
  * Complex and Computational Systems
  * Energy and Sustainability
  * Engineering Education and Pedagogy
  * Materials and Nanotechnology


Graduate students are able to select thesis topics from a diverse range of faculty research interests.
New or prospective graduate students can learn about ongoing research topics from individual faculty members, faculty websites and graduate student seminars. Graduate student seminars, where our students present the results of their research, are held on a regular basis and provide an interactive forum for learning and exchanging ideas.
Toggle Accordion  Learning Outcomes 
Graduates of the program will have the knowledge and skillset required to work broadly in chemical engineering, as related to their concentration, including the ability to:
  * Identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems; and
  * Explain and apply engineering design principles, as appropriate, to the student’s selected concentration.


Toggle Accordion  Graduate Certificates 
Over 15 [graduate certificates](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=Graduate%20Certificate) are available to provide students the opportunity to develop a specialization in an area of their choice, such as nanomedicine and process safety engineering. Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
#### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership Certificate
Students may complete a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/cert-gel/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors, and the required chemical engineering course work.
#### Engineering Business Certificate
Students may complete a Master of Science in Chemical Engineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Business. Students must apply and be admitted to the Galante Engineering Business Program in order to pursue this option. _The program requires the applicant to have earned or be in a program to earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Northeastern University._ The integrated 32-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 16 semester hours of the chemical engineering core courses and 16 semester hours from the outlined business-skill curriculum. The coursework, along with participation in co-curricular professional development elements, earn the Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Business](https://mie.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/cert-enbu/).

* * *
Sustainability
Focused on meeting societal needs for improved energy storage and water delivery while considering impact and feasibility, this course-based concentration delves into materials, chemicals, energy, and the reactions produced.
## Experiential Learning 
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. Northeastern is an R1 research institution, rated among universities with the highest research activity.
The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive edge upon graduation. The College of Engineering has over 3,000 co-op employer partners globally. Our dedicated team of co-op coordinators prepare students for the co-op experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development. Some chemical engineering co-op employers include Ambri, Metalor Technologies, Nano-C, Pellion Technologies, Sanofi Genzyme, and Waters Corporation.
