## Advanced, Smart, and Digital Manufacturing
The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering offers the Master of Science (MS) in Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing (AIM) to meet the growing demand for engineers, researchers, and scientists trained in advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0 technologies.
The advent of the industrial internet of things, additive manufacturing (3D printing) of parts and electronics, advanced materials with unique properties, and efficient manufacturing processes transforms manufacturing operations into advanced manufacturing. Advanced manufacturing focuses on developing innovative technologies to create existing and new products by leveraging novel emerging materials, advanced processes, information, automation, computation, sensing, AI, and digitalization.
Through a curriculum focused on advanced, smart, and digital manufacturing, the MS in Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing prepares students to be researchers for development of advanced manufacturing technologies, and leaders for managing advanced manufacturing enterprises.
The program is open to students with a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, science, mathematics, or equivalent field. This degree program offers students an opportunity to either train for industry jobs with coursework and co-op experience or prepare for a doctoral program through coursework and research experience.

#### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership Certificate
Students may complete a Master of Science in Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/cert-gel/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 32-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 16 semester hours of advisor-approved Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing technical courses.
## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges.
The [cooperative education program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/?utm_source=si-2021-4), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain up to eight months of industry experience as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive advantage after graduation. Northeastern has partnerships with many small and medium-scale manufacturing companies and strong collaborations with large organizations such as GE, IBM, Raytheon, Dell EMC, Flex, Northrop Grumman, and Analog Devices.
Students have robust research opportunities through Northeastern’s multidisciplinary research centers and institutes, including its manufacturing infrastructure such as the [George J. Kostas Nanoscale Technology and Manufacturing Research Center](http://www.kostas.neu.edu), the [National Science Foundation Center for High-Rate Nanomanufacturing](http://www.nano.neu.edu), and the [Advanced Nanomanufacturing Cluster for Smart Sensors and Materials.](https://www.northeastern.edu/cssm/) Other related Northeastern University research centers and institutes are also available such as the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, the Institute for Experiential Robotics, and the Institute for Information Assurance. Northeastern also has partnerships with national research labs, who are involved in advanced manufacturing research, and several industry collaborations.

## Program Goals
Educational Objectives
The MS in Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing produces researchers for the development of advanced manufacturing technologies and leaders for managing advanced manufacturing enterprises.
Career Outlook
Graduates of the MS in Advanced and Intelligent Manufacturing program can join as engineers at high-tech companies, become managers at government agencies, or pursue PhD degrees in advanced manufacturing at U.S. universities. Career opportunities are available in key sectors such as aerospace, automotive, computers, manufacturing, chemical processes, electronics, materials, controls, instruments, and power and energy systems.
The fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, is transforming manufacturing operations to advanced manufacturing by extending digital technology with interconnectedness using the internet of things, access to real-time data, and cyber-physical systems. Globally, nine out of ten companies are investing in digital factories*, and various U.S. federal agencies have collectively created the National Network for Manufacturing and Innovation Institutes (NNMII), referred to as Manufacturing USA, to invest in innovative advanced manufacturing technologies. Northeastern is a member of five NNMIIs. At the same time, according to Talent Board, there is a severe shortage of people trained in advanced manufacturing with 50% to 75% of people applying to positions unqualified, and there is an over 30% shortage of engineers, researchers, and scientists.
