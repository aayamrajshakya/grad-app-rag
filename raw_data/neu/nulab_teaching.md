# Teaching
A presentation on [Our Marathon](https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/) for an Advanced Writing in the Disciplines course
The NULab trains graduate students in digital scholarship through the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities. We collaborate with faculty across the disciplines to integrate digital methods into their courses through the Digital Teaching Integration Initiative (DITI), and our core faculty teach many classes for students interested in digital humanities and computational social science.
