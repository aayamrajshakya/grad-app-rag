Career outlook 
Provide primary care to adults, including geriatric patients, and help them manage and overcome various conditions and illnesses. With a focus on patient wellness and healthy choices, primary care AGNPs (also referred to as AGPNP) manage transitions between care settings and provide caregiver education and evaluation. They often work in long-term care settings and clinics or may have their own private practices. Employers often include long-term care facilities, hospices, and primary care practices.
Overall employment of nurse anesthetists, nurse midwives, and nurse practitioners is projected to grow 45% from 2020 to 2030, much faster than the 8% average for all occupations (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2023).
