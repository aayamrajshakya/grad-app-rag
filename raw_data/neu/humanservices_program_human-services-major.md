The human services major prepares students for careers in social change by providing the theoretical and skill-based background necessary for practice and research. Upon completion of the degree, students apply professional skills in counseling roles, nonprofit management, political advocacy, or organizational and community development. Students have an opportunity to develop a holistic understanding of preventative and reactive responses to social inequality and an understanding of how to impact change at individual and structural levels. Students engage in an integrated educational program that emphasizes experiential approaches to learning through service-learning, co-op, and internship opportunities. 
## Learning Outcomes

  1. Understand and apply core competencies in human services such as political analysis and advocacy, program planning and development within organizations, and fundamental techniques for direct practice (counseling and case management).
  2. Apply an interdisciplinary theoretical framework relevant to practice and research in the field.
  3. Engage in culturally competent ethical human service practice and research with individuals, families, groups, communities and organizations.
  4. Assess and advocate for effective and efficient social practice, programs and policies.
