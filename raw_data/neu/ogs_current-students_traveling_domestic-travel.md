#  Students Studying in The United States 
As an F-1 or J-1 student, there is so much to learn, explore, and discover in the U.S., and OGS encourages you to do it all. Before you do, please understand what documents you should carry with you when traveling within the the U.S. or its territories. 
##  Travel Within the U.S. 
###  The Office of Global Services recommends that all international students and employees carry the following documents as proof of nonimmigrant status: 
  * A valid passport. The passport should always be valid for at least six months after your date of entry to the U.S. 
    * For routine travel (e.g. within your city) you may choose to carry a copy of your passport information page to avoid the risk of losing or misplacing your passport
  * Form I-20 (F-1 Students) or DS-2019 (J-1 Students/Scholars)
  * [Your most recent I-94](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home) which is your arrival/departure record
  * EAD (if applicable)


Any family members traveling with you who have F-2 or J-2 visas should carry the same documents.
Review this [FAQ and guide](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/required-documents-for-non-citizens-in-the-u-s/) to understand the documents that non-U.S. citizens are required to carry while inside the U.S.
Travel Registry
All Northeastern students, faculty, and staff enter their travel itinerary and housing accommodations into the [Travel Registry.](https://globalsafety.northeastern.edu/travel-registry/) This allows the university to communicate directly with travelers if unexpected events or conditions create circumstances that might pose health or safety risks. In addition, it enables on-campus resources and external support providers to better respond to students, faculty, and staff who may need medical or security assistance.
##  The 100-Mile Border Zone 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) may periodically carry out enforcement actions, such as transportation checks or traffic stops, in areas close to the U.S.-Canada and the U.S.-Mexico borders, as well as the U.S. coastline. These activities are conducted under CBP’s stated authority to perform random checks within a 100-mile zone from any external boundary of the United States. To remain compliant, students are advised to always carry the valid travel documents as listed above. 
To learn more about the 100-mile border zone, review the [ACLU “Know Your Rights” website.](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/border-zone)

When you travel, carry both the new passport and the old passport that contains your student visa if your country of citizenship allows you to keep your old passport. If your country does not allow you to keep your old passport that contains the valid F-1 or J-1 visa, you will need to apply for a new visa the next time you travel abroad.
