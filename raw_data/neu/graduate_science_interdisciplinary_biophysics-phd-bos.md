## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Biophysics PhD program at Northeastern University is a combined and cross-disciplinary program that draws expertise from the physics, biology, and chemistry departments. Designed to meet the growing need for interdisciplinary research, this program focuses on the application of physical and chemical principles to understand complex biological systems. Through this unique partnership, students explore biological phenomena at all scales, from molecules to entire organisms, using quantitative and experimental methods.
This program offers a comprehensive curriculum that includes core courses in statistical mechanics, chemistry, and cell and molecular biology, along with a recurring graduate biophysics seminar. Emphasizing both theoretical knowledge and practical experience, the program covers techniques such as spectroscopy, computational modeling, and advanced microscopy, while also promoting the development of essential skills in data science and machine learning. This approach is designed to enable students to address significant scientific challenges in fields such as biotechnology and health sciences.
Structured under the College of Science’s cross-disciplinary science PhD umbrella, the program allows for flexibility based on each student’s background and career goals. Students engage in research rotations and are encouraged to seek external internships to broaden their professional experience and network. The program’s structure supports students as they build a solid foundation in biophysics, preparing them for candidacy exams and offering pathways into diverse scientific careers.
Successful graduates of the Biophysics PhD program are equipped to excel in academia, industry, and beyond. By fostering a collaborative research environment that draws on the strengths of multiple disciplines, this program aims to produce scientists capable of groundbreaking research with a lasting impact on both science and society.
