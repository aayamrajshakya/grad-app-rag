The Doctoral Program in School Psychology is a full-time program that prepares the next generation of leaders in the field. Doctoral level school psychologists conduct research, teach, supervise students and professionals, consult with school systems, teachers and families, and provide direct services to children. School psychologists also play a central role in planning and evaluating school-based educational and health promotion programs.
Northeastern’s doctoral program includes all components of the MS/CAGS in School Psychology in addition to a major focus on research and additional fieldwork experiences. The doctoral program espouses a scientist-practitioner training model, as set forth by the American Psychological Association (APA). The program is fully accredited by the APA and National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). It is designed for students to meet state and national certification requirements for school psychology and pursue state licensure for psychologists. The program emphasizes applied research related to the education, development, and health promotion of children, and scientifically-based practice in schools, community centers, and hospitals. The program has three principal themes and five major training goals, which are described below.
