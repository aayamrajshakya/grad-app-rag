2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Globalization has created a world of new opportunities for those savvy enough to recognize them and acquire the new skill sets needed for success in international government, consulting, business and industry, nonprofit, and educational sectors.
This program is designed to prepare students for internationally focused positions that range from traditional practitioners of diplomacy; to development workers; to executives employed in the dynamic world of international consultancy, trade, and industry. With courses enriched by classmates from every continent, students are active learners in a collaborative, cross-cultural setting from their very first course.
The core curriculum ensures all students have a solid grounding in foundational courses such as international politics, economics, security, and diplomacy. Students then select from a broad-based menu of concentrations, allowing them to develop specialties. The program culminates in a capstone experience in which students elect to write a thesis, engage in a case study, or undertake short-term travel to conduct intensive field research.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
