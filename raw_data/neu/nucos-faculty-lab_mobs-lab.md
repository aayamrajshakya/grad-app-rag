  * ### [Alessandro Vespignani](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/alessandro-vespignani/)
Alessandro Vespignani research activity is focused on the study of “techno-social” systems, where infrastructures composed of different technological layers are interoperating within the social component that drives their use and development. In this context we aim at understanding how the very same elements assembled in large number can give rise – according to the various […]
