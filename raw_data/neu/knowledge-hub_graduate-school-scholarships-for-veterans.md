Paying for graduate school doesn’t have to be a challenge for veterans who want to build a rewarding civilian career. If you have already used all or a portion of your military benefits to pursue an undergraduate degree, there are still several other options for [funding your education](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/paying-for-college-military/), such as scholarships, [grants](https://www.northeastern.edu/bachelors-completion/news/college-grants-for-veterans/), and fellowships.
Below is a list of eight graduate school scholarships for veterans that can help you finance your education.
## 1. [Patriot Scholar Program](https://military.northeastern.edu/fund-your-education/scholarships/)
Northeastern University created the Patriot Scholar Program to recognize veterans for their service and aid them in their professional development. The scholarship covers expenses such as tuition, books and supplies, housing, transportation, child care, and study abroad programs. Since the grant award isn’t fixed, applicants are required to specify the amount of funds they need.
### Who is eligible?
To qualify for the Patriot Scholar Program, you must be a servicemember or an honorably discharged veteran who has been deployed in the past. On the application, you’ll need to explain how your military service helped you grow personally and provide examples of your leadership skills. The scholarship specifically celebrates veterans who gained “a unique global perspective” through their deployment experiences.
### How to apply
To apply, [download the application](https://military.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Patriot-Scholar-Program-Application-v2020.pdf) and submit the completed form to [[email protected]](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#4b051e1d2e3f380b2524393f232e2a383f2e3925652e2f3e).
## 2. [Phi Gamma Pi Veterans Scholarship](https://military.northeastern.edu/fund-your-education/scholarships/)
Current and former servicemembers who have used up other VA education benefits, such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill® and Yellow Ribbon Program, may qualify for the Phi Gamma Pi Veterans Scholarship at Northeastern. This grant can help you cover some of your remaining educational expenses to ease any financial burdens.
### Who is eligible?
Active-duty servicemembers and veterans who were deployed to a combat zone are eligible for this scholarship. Children of veterans may also qualify if their parent is a servicemember who was wounded or killed in action.
