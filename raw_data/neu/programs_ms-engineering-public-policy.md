Program overview 
##  Engineering meets public policy 
Northeastern University’s Master of Science in Engineering and Public Policy provides the knowledge and tools needed to combine engineering analysis with public policy and decision-making.
This program covers the core skills necessary to link engineering design and analysis research with the economic and policy contexts needed for decisions that affect society at large. You’ll study specific engineering applications within one of the concentrations, coupled with fundamental methodologies in policy analysis, economics, and statistics.

Program features 
  * Interdisciplinary core with courses from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs
  * Option to pursue coursework-only, project-based, or thesis tracks
  * Can be combined with a [Gordon Engineering Leadership](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/program/graduate-certificate-in-engineering-leadership-5272/) certificate or other graduate certificates from the College of Engineering
  * Opportunity to participate in Northeastern’s leading cooperative education program, gaining up to eight months of professional experience


Career outlook 
Issues of climate change, environmental health, resource sustainability, and resilience are some of the most pressing public policy challenges facing today’s engineers. The security of our communities relies on the resilience of our critical infrastructure systems, spanning buildings, transportation, water, or cyber infrastructure. Whether considering a technical career with government environmental agencies, such as the EPA, or interfacing with policy from within an engineering firm, this degree equips students with a broad range of skills to become engineering policy leaders in both the public and private sectors.
