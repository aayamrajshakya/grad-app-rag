## About the program
With the Online Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) from the College of Engineering at Northeastern University, you’ll learn how to use technology to solve complex challenges for businesses, organizations, and communities around the world.
Designed for graduates and working professionals from any background — including those without a technical degree — the MSIS equips you with practical technical skills and business management expertise to lead digital transformation. You’ll gain applied knowledge in areas like UX design, software development, data analytics, and digital business processes while building confidence in core concepts like data management, quality assurance, and agile methodologies.
You can tailor your degree with career-aligned Focus Areas in Cyber & Information Security, Software Testing & Quality Assurance, or Product Management & DevOps Leadership — each designed to match in-demand roles and skill sets employers need now.
If you’re new to advanced math or programming, you can start with our low-cost Information Systems Foundations pathway to build the basics and prepare for success in the full master’s program.
With this flexible, future-ready skill set, you’ll be positioned for diverse technical and leadership roles — from IT project manager or systems administrator to security analyst, QA engineer, or product manager — ready to help organizations innovate and grow.

## Spring 2026 pathway courses
Explore the Fast App Performance-Based pathway courses starting January 2026. Use the course outlines to start preparing in advance of the courses starting. For your performance-based pathway, you'll enroll in INFO 5100 and your choice of available elective shown below for a total of two courses.
##### INFO 5100: Application Engineering & Development
Note: INFO 5100 must be taken first or in combination with other available course.
Takes students in a step-by-step manner through the process of systematically combining UX techniques, business processes, and complex data models to assemble applications that are user-friendly and meet business requirements. Employs the object-oriented paradigm, visual user experience, and system design principles to put together complicated, powerful, real-world applications. The primary objective of this course is to practice social-technical software engineering methods and tools to solve real-world problems. Offers students an opportunity to learn innovative design and programming techniques to build significant business applications quickly; to practice simple and smart ways of making software construction enjoyable; and to master the art of how to systematically write software programs to solve any business problem.
