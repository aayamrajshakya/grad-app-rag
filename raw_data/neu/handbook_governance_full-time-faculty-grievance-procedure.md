From time to time within the University community, disputes may arise between a faculty member and a department chair (or equivalent), Dean, Provost, or other administrator in which there are allegations of inequitable treatment, violation of academic freedom, or violation of University policy or procedures in some action which affects the faculty member. Administrators should work carefully to avoid such situations and, should they occur, make every effort to resolve them before they become formal grievances. Similarly, faculty should understand that mediating a formal grievance will involve a major investment of their colleagues’ time, and should use the procedure only to resolve important issues. When such a dispute arises, it is important that the parties work in good faith to resolve the situation informally, as quickly as possible. The aggrieved faculty member should attempt to meet with the person whose action is the focus of the dispute in order to discuss and resolve the situation. If resolution is not achieved,they should attempt to meet first with the Dean and, if the Dean is unable to resolve the dispute, then with the Provost (or Provost’s representative) to make them aware of the situation and discuss paths to resolution. If, after making these attempts at informal resolution, the faculty member is not satisfied, they may proceed formally within the regular grievance procedure, including the option for Early Provostial Review.3
  1. ### Definitions and Eligibility
    1. Definition of “Grievance”  
A grievance is defined as a complaint by a faculty member that they:
      1. had been subject to a violation, misinterpretation or inequitable application of the provisions of the Faculty Handbook or other published University or unit policies or procedures; or
      2. had otherwise been treated unfairly or inequitably.
    2. Eligibility and Applicability  
This procedure is available to all full-time faculty. This grievance procedure does not apply with respect to tenure or early tenure decisions nor does it apply to a Dismissal Proceeding or any final action pursuant to it. If a grievant makes a claim of discriminatory acts prohibited by law or by University policy, the grievance shall first be pursued through the Office of University Equity and Compliance and its procedures. When this has been completed, any aspects of the grievance which remain unresolved may then be brought to the grievance procedure.
  2. ### Regular Grievance Procedure
    1. Step One: Filing a Grievance
      1. A grievance must be filed within three months after the faculty member became aware of the grievable event. During this period, the grievant must attempt to resolve the matter informally.
      2. A formal grievance is filed in writing with the Senate Agenda Committee. The Senate’s grievance coordinator will send copies to the Department Chair (or equivalent), Dean, Provost, and (if not one of these) the person whose action occasioned the grievance.
      3. In the formal grievance, the grievant will state the exact nature of the grievance, against whom it is filed, and the remedy sought. At this point they may request resolution through the Early Provostial Review Option.
      4. In the event that informal steps to resolve the situation are ongoing, the grievant may request, in writing, that the Senate Agenda Committee automatically grant postponement of the Step Two for an additional two months. At any time that the grievant is dissatisfied with the progress of informal steps, they may, in writing, rescind this request and resume the normal grievance process
    2. Step Two: Mediation by an ad hoc Faculty Committee
      1. As soon as possible after the Senate Agenda Committee has received notice of a grievance, or notice that Early Provostial Review has not resolved the grievance, it shall appoint an ad hoc4
      2. The ad hocad hoc
      3. As soon as reasonably possible after the establishment of the ad hoc
        1. After an initial meeting with the grievant, the ad hoc
          1. If the Committee rules that the entire grievance does not meet this threshold, it shall so inform the grievant, the other relevant parties, the Provost and the Senate Agenda Committee.
          2. If the Committee rules that only some of the issues raised in the grievance do not meet this threshold, it shall so inform the grievant, the other relevant parties, the Provost and the Senate Agenda Committee, also stipulating the issues which remain to be mediated. In this circumstance, mediation will proceed with respect to the remaining issues. Neither mediation nor arbitration will remain available for the issues deemed non-grievable.
        2. As the mediation process continues, if the Committee deems it advisable, it may require the attendance of the person whose action occasioned the grievance and any other persons who might be of aid in resolving the grievance, such as the Director of the Office of University Equity and Compliance, or the Director of the Disability Resource Center.
      4. If mediation is unsuccessful without the participation of the Dean, the Committee shall require the attendance of the Dean for at least one meeting to attempt to reach a resolution.
      5. If no resolution has been formalized within ten working days of the last Step Two meeting, or if the ad hocad hocad hocad hoc
      6. If, after this meeting, no resolution has yet been reached, the ad hoc
    3. Step Three: Request for Arbitration
      1. If the grievant is not satisfied with the disposition of the grievance at Step Two, or if no decision has been rendered within ten working days after the meeting with the Provost (Step Two) or within ten working days of receipt of a proposed resolution formally submitted by the ad hocad hoc
      2. The ad hoc
      3. If the ad hoc
      4. If the ad hoc
      5. If the ad hoc
    4. Step Four: Arbitration
      1. If the grievance is to be arbitrated, the ad hoc
      2. Within fifteen calendar days after the notification of the Provost, the Provost (or their designee) shall meet with the grievant for the purpose of explaining the process of filing a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. At the request of the grievant or the Provost, the ad hoc
      3. The arbitrator shall be chosen from a list of arbitrators maintained by the American Arbitration Association, or a comparable arbitration agency acceptable to the grievant and the University. The arbitrator must be qualified for academic arbitration by virtue of current or previous service as a faculty member or academic administrator of a college or a university. The conduct of the proceedings shall be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
      4. The decision of the arbitrator, within the scope of their jurisdiction, shall be final and binding on the parties to the dispute and the University; however, the arbitrator shall be without power to:
        1. make a decision which requires the commission of an act prohibited by law,
        2. substitute their judgment on the professional qualifications of a faculty member for the judgment of the relevant academic committee, or
        3. add to, subtract from, or modify provisions of the Faculty Handbook or other relevant University policies and procedures.
      5. The costs of the services of the arbitrator or arbitrator’s associate shall be borne as follows:
        1. If the arbitrator upholds the grievance (whether or not the remedy sought by the grievant is granted), these costs will be borne by the University.
        2. If the arbitrator denies the grievance, the grievant will pay 1/3 of the fees of the American Arbitration Association (or comparable arbitration agency acceptable to the grievant and the University) and its arbitrator, and the University shall bear the remainder of such costs.
        3. Each party will pay for its own expenses, services and fees other than the costs of the American Arbitration Association (or comparable arbitration agency acceptable to the grievant and the University) and the arbitrator.
        4. To assure that the conditions of section (b) can be met, the grievant will place into a non-interest bearing escrow account in the Northeastern University Federal Credit Union, a sum equal to one-half of the American Arbitration Association (or comparable arbitration agency acceptable to the grievant and the University) processing fee plus one-half of one day’s arbitrator’s fee. Specific instructions for establishment of the escrow account are set by the Senate Agenda Committee and are available in the Faculty Senate office.The escrow account will be controlled by the Chair of the Senate Agenda Committee. Upon completion of the arbitration, with the signature of the Agenda Committee Chair and a copy of the arbitrator’s decision, the deposited funds will be returned to the grievant if the grievance is upheld, or transferred to the University if the grievance is denied. If the arbitrator reaches a split decision on a multi-element grievance, the arbitrator will determine the proportional distribution of the AAA/Arbitrator costs and the distribution of the deposited funds.
    5. Miscellaneous
      1. Timeliness
        1. The time limit for filing a grievance as specified in section 2.a may be extended beyond three months with written agreement of the Provost, the grievant and the Senate Agenda Committee grievance officer.
        2. It is important that grievances be processed as rapidly as possible. The number of days indicated at each step shall be considered a maximum, and every effort will be made to expedite the process. However. the time limits specified may be extended by mutual agreement if it is difficult to form an ad hoc
        3. Because it is difficult to form an ad hoc
        4. A grievant shall have two weeks to respond after each step. If they fail to respond by the end of two weeks the grievance will be considered as waived. An involuntary delay such as illness or failure of the mails to deliver shall not be construed as waiving the grievance.
      2. If in the course of processing the grievance there is a dispute over whether a grievance has been waived, the parties will continue to follow the procedure and, if the grievant proceeds to arbitration, the arbitrator will decide whether or not the grievance has been waived.
      3. Unless the grievance has been resolved, withdrawn or otherwise terminated, the ad hoc
      4. Copies of the arbitration decision shall be sent to the grievant, the Provost and the Chair of the Senate Agenda Committee.
      5. No outside counsel (for the grievant or any other party to the grievance) may be present in any of the Step Two mediation meetings. However, all parties may be represented by counsel in arbitration proceedings.
      6. The University shall make available to the grievant relevant materials pertaining to the case. However, documents developed in tenure and promotion proceedings with the understanding that they are confidential do not have to be made available to the grievant.5
      7. The Senate Agenda Committee will, upon request, provide the grievant and/or the person whose action occasioned the grievance with the names of faculty members or others who may be of assistance in preparation and presentation of their case in the grievance procedure.
      8. It is important that testimony and deliberations which take place under this procedure shall be kept confidential by the parties and by those involved in the resolution of the grievance.
      9. If at any point the grievant determines to withdraw the grievance, they shall do so in writing to the Senate Agenda Committee.
      10. If, during the course of a grievance, the grievant’s University employment terminates for any reason, the grievance shall be discontinued, except that when the grievance involves non-renewal of contract the grievant may request, in writing to the Senate Agenda Committee, that the grievance be continued.
  3. ### Early Provostial Review Option for Use in Case of Alleged Procedural Violations
    1. At the time a grievance is filed as defined above, the grievant may request this option of early review by the Provost. In this event, the timeliness provisions for further steps of the Regular Grievance Procedure are suspended until the grievant receives written notice of the results of this optional procedure.
    2. The grievant and a representative of the Senate Agenda Committee will confer with a representative of the Provost within ten workdays. If the Provost’s representative recognizes merit in the grievance, they shall so notify the Provost. Otherwise, they shall inform the grievant, in writing, that the grievance is denied.
    3. If the Provost recognizes merit in the grievance, the Provost shall delegate a representative to work with the appropriate Dean or Chair toward correcting the defective procedures. This process, which may involve any steps up to and including a full reconsideration of the original decision upon which the grievance is based, utilizing corrected procedures, should be completed within two weeks. At that time the grievant will be informed of their status by the Dean or Chair.
    4. Whatever the outcome of this provostial review procedure, the grievant shall still have access to the standard faculty grievance procedure.
