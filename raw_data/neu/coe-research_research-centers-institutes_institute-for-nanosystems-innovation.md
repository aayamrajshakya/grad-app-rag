#  Institute for NanoSystems Innovation 
The [Institute for NanoSystems Innovation ](https://nanosi.northeastern.edu/)at Northeastern University is a global hub focused on pioneering semiconductor research, learning, and innovation. It is helping researchers, government and industry strengthen the country’s semiconductor capacity by driving the discovery, pilot manufacturing, and transition of the new NanoSystems technologies.
The purpose of the institute is to:
  * Explore advanced technologies developed by an interdisciplinary research team specializing in micro/nano technology, quantum engineering, electronics, sensors, machine learning, artificial intelligence, photonics, terahertz and radio frequency systems, computing, and biotechnology.
  * Build new generations of smart devices and systems capable of addressing fundamental technology gaps in several fields including the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, Quantum Engineering, Digital Agriculture, Robotics and Healthcare.
  * Bridge the gap by leveraging our university-wide innovation ecosystem and offering the complete value chain to prototype development and pilot manufacturing with the aim of reducing the time for innovation and technology transition to the private sector.


From electrical engineering to entrepreneurship—the Institute of NanoSystems Innovation is powered by a cross-disciplinary team of innovators and changemakers.
