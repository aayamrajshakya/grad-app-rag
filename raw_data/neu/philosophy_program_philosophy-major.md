#  MajorsPhilosophy Major
Philosophy is a basic field of inquiry. Its range encompasses ideas and issues in every domain of human experience, and its methods apply to problems of an unlimited variety. This major can develop not only philosophical skill and sophistication but also critical thinking and writing abilities that are readily applicable to pursuits in other academic areas, useful in careers far removed from philosophy, and valuable in everyday social and personal life. The study can profoundly affect both the thinking one does and the kind of person one is. 
There are several concentrations within the major from which students can choose.
