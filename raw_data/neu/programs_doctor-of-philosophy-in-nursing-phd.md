## Advance the science   
of nursing through innovation and interdisciplinary inquiry.
The PhD in Nursing program at Northeastern University prepares future nurse-scientists to advance nursing through innovation and interdisciplinary inquiry to improve the health of individuals and communities. Graduates are expected to lead research initiatives that advance nursing science through knowledge development and interdisciplinary scholarly inquiry.
Students will study with nursing faculty who collectively have a variety of expertise and interests and whose research addresses questions that extend across a broad health spectrum. 
In addition, students have an opportunity to study with faculty from other Northeastern departments, as well as with other Boston-area researchers. This collaboration allows students to work across disciplines and to access populations and sites essential for completing a dissertation.

## Frequently
### What’s the difference between the DNP and PhD programs?
Northeastern offers two different doctoral degrees in nursing: the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) and Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP). The PhD is a research-oriented degree, while the DNP is practice-oriented. Nurses interested in leadership might be interested in the DNP, whereas those interested in becoming nurse scientists would be a good fit for the PhD program.
