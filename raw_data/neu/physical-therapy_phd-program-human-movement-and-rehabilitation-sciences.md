## Translating innovative research from bench to clinic
Our PhD in Human Movement and Rehabilitation Sciences prepares you to conduct independent and original basic, translational, and applied research to restore and maximize human functional capacity and promote health and wellbeing across the lifespan. 
Our interdisciplinary program and its faculty, emphasize core competencies in movement and rehabilitation science, cognitive and behavioral science, and communication science.
Students get: 
  * Interdisciplinary mentoring by distinguished faculty 
  * To conduct innovative research that positively impacts human lives and wellbeing 
  * Core training in movement and rehabilitation science, cognitive and behavioral science and communication science 


We leverage our unique faculty and research laboratories as well as our highly ranked programs in Bouvé College of Health Sciences, the College of Science, the College of Engineering, College of Arts, Media and Design, and Center for Cognitive and Brain Health. 
Northeastern is dedicated to advancing the field of clinical and rehabilitation science, translating research from bench to clinic and promoting lifelong wellbeing from early development through successful aging in the community. 
Students benefit from our new research laboratories utilizing state-of-the-art movement and rehabilitation methods including virtual reality, ultrasound, neuroscience, neurophysiology, robotics, and movement measurement technologies.

##  Human Movement and Rehabilitation Sciences PhD 
## Curriculum
Our doctoral students conduct research that address several factors in human movement, rehabilitation, cognition, behavior and communication science, including but not limited to: 
  * Health promotion across the lifespan from early childhood to aging 
  * Psychology of human movement and communication 
  * Exercise, speech and cognitive neuroscience 
  * Rehabilitation and assistive technology 


  * Virtual environments for rehabilitation
