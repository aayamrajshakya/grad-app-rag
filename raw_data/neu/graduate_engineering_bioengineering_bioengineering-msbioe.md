## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Bioengineering is engineering in a biological context such as the human body, an ecosystem, or a bioreactor. In every case, the interface between engineered and biological systems places unique constraints on the design and implementation of devices, instruments, or implants. These depend on the properties of the biological system involved and the functionality that is being created.
The interface of engineering and medicine as embodied in bioengineering will be one of the most exciting endeavors and greatest adventures of the 21st century. Job opportunities are expected to expand dramatically with a focus on development of entirely new classes of products, instrumentation, and implants. The impact to human health will be extraordinary.
Bioengineering is intrinsically multidisciplinary and it is essential that students learn the languages used by multidisciplinary teams. To that end, our curriculum is structured around a core of six courses that analyze biological systems from every possible quantitative point of view. On the completion of the core, students select one of four concentrations, which provides the opportunity to develop a deep level of expertise in a specific area of bioengineering.
Bioengineering students will have unique opportunities in the classroom, research labs, and experiential learning. The projects that they may be able to contribute to include bio-bandages that monitor bacterial growth or that help damaged ligaments heal faster; sheets of cells folded like origami to form a working kidney; and new materials that—like a leaf in the sun—automatically sense and adapt to changes in the environment. 
Our graduate program includes four concentrations, including:
  * Biomechanics and Mechanobiology
  * Biomedical Devices and Bioimaging
  * Molecular, Cell, and Tissue Engineering 
  * Systems, Synthetic, and Computational Bioengineering


## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Master's Degree in Bioengineering with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Bioengineering in addition to earning a [Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 33-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 17 hours of advisor-approved bioengineering technical courses. For students who concurrently enroll in the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, 16 semester hours of the certificate coursework may be applied to the requirements of the coursework option of any concentration of this program.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated. 
Note: iomechanics and mechanobiology; biomedical devices and bioimaging; molecular, cellor systems, synthetic, and computational bioengineering. Consult your college administrator.
