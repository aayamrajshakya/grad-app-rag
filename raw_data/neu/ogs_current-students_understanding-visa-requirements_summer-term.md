####  [ If I maintain full-time enrollment with on-ground presence during the summer term(s) can this term be considered as accrued time toward eligibility for F-1/J-1 benefits for work authorization? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/summer-term/#collapse-1)
Some benefits require you to have been enrolled full-time in F-1 or J-1 status for a certain number of semesters/quarters in order to be eligible. You may count the summer term towards this requirement if you are enrolled full-time in the full summer or in the summer quarter; part-time summer enrollment and enrollment in summer 1 or summer 2 only cannot be counted towards eligibility for these benefits.
####  [ If the summer is not required for me, can I still enroll in classes? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/summer-term/#collapse-2)
Yes! You may enroll in both in-person and online courses at your leisure. However, if you plan to engage in any practical training opportunities, you must receive employment authorization.
