> The leadership concentration and coursework will be helpful as I continue my time in the Coast Guard and management positions. Leadership is a skill demanded of military personnel as you lead teams of various sizes through different missions and goals. My concentration has introduced a lot of new techniques and skills to help me best manage those teams.
