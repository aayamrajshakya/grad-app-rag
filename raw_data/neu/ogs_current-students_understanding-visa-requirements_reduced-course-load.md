#  Students Studying in The United States 
F-1 and J-1 students must enroll in and maintain enrollment in a full-time course load during every required academic term; however, federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load due to specific and limited academic or medical circumstances. 
##  When is a Reduced Course Load (RCL) Permitted? 
The limited exceptions to full-time enrollment include:
  * Academic Difficulties
  * Medical Conditions
  * Final Academic Term of Study


##  Types of RCLs 
###  Prior authorization is required for the Academic and Medical RCL. Please do not drop/withdraw from courses without prior authorization. 
####  [ Academic Difficulties ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/reduced-course-load/#collapse-63436342-1)
Students who are experiencing academic difficulties in their first term of study in the U.S. may be eligible to request authorization to drop below full-time status upon the recommendation of their academic/program advisor. This is referred to as an Academic RCL. Students may only drop below full-time status after receiving the authorization from the Office of Global Services (OGS). 
The reasons allowed for an academic difficulty RCL include:
  * Improper course placement (e.g. you registered for a course and then you and/or the professor discover that a prerequisite requirement is needed)
  * Unfamiliarity with American teaching methods
  * Initial difficulty with English language
  * Initial difficulty with reading requirements


Please note for an Academic RCL: 
  * Failing a class is **not** a sufficient reason to apply for a reduced course load
  * Students must receive authorization from OGS for a reduced course load **before** dropping below full-time status or **before** registering for a reduced number of courses
  * Students must still be enrolled in at least 50% of a full-time course load and must continue to maintain on-ground presence for the duration of the academic term
  * A reduced course load for academic difficulties may only be taken in the initial academic term and only once per academic degree level

####  [ Medical Conditions ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/reduced-course-load/#collapse-63436342-2)
Students who are experiencing a medical condition that prevents them from maintaining full-time enrollment may be eligible for a Medical RCL. Medical RCLs are available in very limited circumstances, and require students to work closely with other offices at Northeastern University.
Academic Accommodations due to Medical Conditions
Students may apply for academic accommodations through [Disability Access Services (DAS)](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu/). Sometimes, academic accommodations may be recommended in the form of a medical RCL.
Please note that DAS’ accommodations request process takes at least 2-3 weeks. 
  * Students must consult with [Disability Access Services (DAS)](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu/) to determine their eligibility for a medical RCL or other academic accommodations 
    * If DAS determines a student is eligible, the student must provide additional documentation from a licensed medical doctor (MD), psychiatrist, doctor of osteopathy (DO), licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist (Ph.D. or PsyD.) practicing in the United States. The documentation must specify if it is recommended that the student enroll in a part-time course load as well as the time period for the recommended medical RCL and must be received by OGS prior to dropping/withdrawing from classes.
  * If approved by DAS, OGS will apply a medical RCL to the student’s SEVIS record for the duration of the academic term


Medical Leave of Absence
Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) are reviewed and approved by University Health & Counseling Services (UHCS). A MLOA may, in some circumstances, include the processing of a medical RCL by OGS.
  * Students must work with University Health & Counseling Services (UHCS) to apply for a Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA). 
  * Please see OGS’ [Medical Leave of Absence](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/leaves-of-absence/medical-leave-of-absence/) page for more information.


####  [ Final Academic Term ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/reduced-course-load/#collapse-63436342-3)
Students who are in their final academic term of their program of study may qualify for a **Final Term RCL** if they do not need a full-time course load to complete the requirements for their degree. No authorization from OGS is needed in this situation, though we do advise students to confirm with their academic advisor that all graduation requirements have been met. Please see the [Final Term](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/final-term/) page for more information.
In rare situations, a student may request a S**econd Final Term RCL** if they were unable to complete their degree requirements in the final term. This is usually limited to students who received a failing grade for a required course in their final term. No more than two consecutive Final Term RCL approvals may be granted. If you need to request a second Final Term RCL, please [contact OGS](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/contact/) to schedule an appointment with a Designated School Official (DSO).
