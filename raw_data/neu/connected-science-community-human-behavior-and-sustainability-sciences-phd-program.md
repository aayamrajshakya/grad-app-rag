#  Connected Science Community Human Behavior and Sustainability Sciences PhD Program 
[How To Apply](https://cos.northeastern.edu/admissions/graduate-programs/how-to-apply/)
## A new kind of PhD training
Conduct groundbreaking human behavior and sustainability sciences research and develop skills that open a vast set of future careers with the support of a cross-College PhD Community!
The Connected Science Community Human Behavior and Sustainability Sciences PhD Program combines training in cognitive, behavioral, and social sciences with training in environmental, ecological, and sustainability sciences to produce boundary-breaking scholars who can accelerate sustainability solutions that are robustly informed by trans-disciplinary science through a research-intensive curriculum and environment within a supportive community of faculty and students.
Students design individualized programs of study by apprenticing in a laboratory in environmental / sustainability sciences and one in human cognition and behavior, working closely with their faculty mentors throughout their time in the program. Research areas include cultural and experiential differences in ecological thinking, social and environmental policy and decision-making, influence of urban and wild green spaces on cognitive and brain health, fisheries and restoration sciences, evolutionary genomics, and marine biodiversity and conservation.
You will be joining a graduate program that is committed to cultivating a culture of respect and collaboration where the contribution of each person is valued.

Network Science
### [Psychology of Misinformation Lab](https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-faculty-lab/psychology-of-misinformation-lab/)
Research in the Psychology of Misinformation Lab investigates what drives belief in inaccurate information, why certain individuals are predisposed to refrain from belief change even in the face of good corrective evidence, and how corrections can be designed to maximize impact.

### [Brain Game Center for Mental Fitness and Well-being](https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-faculty-lab/brain-game-center/)
Led by Drs. Aaron Seitz and Susanne Jaeggi, our lab strives to improve your brain’s fitness. We research, test, and disseminate evidence-based, scientifically optimized brain fitness games that assist you in real life with memory, vision, hearing, learning, and more. We have a track record of making our tested procedures publicly available so that our innovations help our community and the world.

### [Learning and Brain Development Lab](https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-faculty-lab/learning-and-brain-development-lab/)
How do we use information we have learned? Does the way people learn and apply knowledge change across development? In the Learning and Brain Development lab, we investigate the development of brain systems for different ways of learning during adolescence, and the impact of learning on memory, decision making, and cognitive control. We are interested in understanding how behavioral and brain changes in adolescence may be adaptive for the situations and goals that arise in this stage of life.

### [Center for Cognitive and Brain Health](https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-faculty-lab/center-for-cognitive-and-brain-health/)
The Center investigates the effects of lifestyle choices and health behaviors (e.g., physical activity, diet) and their physiological sequelae (e.g., fitness, adiposity) on brain and cognition. From a neuroimaging perspective, the researchers’ interests lie in understanding how health influences brain and behavior as it relates to increased health and effective functioning for individuals across the lifespan.

### [Social Emotions Lab](https://cos.northeastern.edu/nucos-faculty-lab/social-emotions-lab/)
Dr. DeSteno’s research focuses on the role of emotion in social cognition and behavior.


## The Connected Science Community PhD
Upon joining the program, you will also join a Connected Science Community of PhD students across the College of Science. During the summer before your first year, you will have the option to participate in the [Summer Skills Session](https://cos.northeastern.edu/cos-phd-summer-program/) to develop key skills, explore and utilize university resources, and learn about potential post-PhD careers.
During Fall semester of your first year, you will begin coursework and continue research in your department. Throughout your first year and beyond, you will continue your research while sustaining your Connected Science Community through seminars, workshops, and social activities.
In this [unique PhD training](https://cos.northeastern.edu/admissions/graduate-programs/connected-phd-programs/) program, you’ll:
  * join a Community of PhD students across all College of Science departments, who learn from each other, collaborate, and draw on one other’s experience
  * develop Career and Core Skills and inside knowledge of the outstanding career opportunities open to our PhD graduates
  * explore Cross-Disciplinary Research to help you solve pressing research challenges
  * gain external work experience – an integral part of your professional training, with many opportunities
