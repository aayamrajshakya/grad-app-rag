# Cycles of Conflict, a Century of Continuity: How Place Shaped the Women’s Movement over One Hundred Years
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
The tension between social stability and social change is foundational to social science: society is constantly changing, yet institutions are slow to change. It is the intersection of these two dynamics that is ultimately responsible for macro social patterns, but measuring this intersection is difficult to do at scale. In this project, I use a combination of network analysis, computational text analysis, and qualitative analysis to measure stability and change within the women’s movement, specifically their claims-making strategies, over a one hundred year period, 1865 to 1975. During these years the United States experienced dramatic changes in politics and economics, and the women’s movement changed with changing social structures, shifting from a focus on political change to a focus on cultural and social change. I find, however, that within this changing society there was a stable core to the movement’s claims-making strategies, and this core reflected subtle distinctive features of place. I introduce the concept of persistent place-based political logics as a crucial meso-level structure shaping the claims-making strategies of social movements. Changes in national political and discursive structures, including the civil rights and New Left movements, introduced new ideas, concepts, and tactics into the claims-making activities of the women’s movement, and activists consciously and strategically reacted to their particular political moment. These strategic choices were filtered in and through these persistent place-based political logics, however, grounding the choices made by activists in a coherent, local, organizing strategy.
In addition to comparing the power of place in shaping the structure of the women’s movement, I further examine the structural and cultural reasons why, over the longue durée, some of the organizations and ideas within this movement succeeded (e.g., the formation of the juvenile court system and the idea that all children have the right to a childhood), and other ideas and organizations failed (e.g., women as a progressive voting bloc and the Equal Rights Amendment). I use the ideas that succeeded within this movement to discuss the enduring impact of the women’s movement on our every day lives in the contemporary era.
