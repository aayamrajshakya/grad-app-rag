Northeastern University’s D’Amore-McKim School of Business prepares resilient finance leaders to weather a changing business world. The [Full-Time MBA / MSF Finance](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-ms-finance-mba?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=ftmsfmba) dual degree program integrates business knowledge with a deep understanding of finance to prepare students to be the leaders that today’s business world demands.
## Develop Deep Finance Expertise
Students pursue rigorous coursework laser focused on financial theory and practice. Students have an opportunity to gain advanced financial skills and high-level knowledge to drive financial strategy, increase shareholder value, support flexible operating models, minimize risk, and maximize revenue through the finance courses.
## Select a Concentration 
Students specialize their MBA degree by selecting a concentration in either corporate finance or investments. In the corporate finance concentration, students master a range of financial, analytical, and communication skills for increasing profitability and shareholder value. In the investments concentration, students become knowledgeable managers of assets for individuals or institutions, building their expertise in capital allocation, valuation, or risk management.
## Integrating Classroom and Professional Experiences
Learning by doing is a hallmark of a Northeastern MBA. Students apply their knowledge to actual business challenges through experience-powered electives and class projects. Through a corporate residency, students gain invaluable experience at the intersection of business and finance, translating ideas into action for three, six, or up to 12 months. Far removed from the typical internship, students work full time at a leading firm or startup in their field and have significant responsibilities as they work to deliver on organizational goals.
Students can apply to gain valuable experience performing equity research and portfolio management in a student-managed mutual fund, The 360 Huntington Fund. By participating in the Fund, students may earn 1 semester hour per semester with the option to fulfill a 3-semester-hour elective course requirement by participating for three terms. 
Through coursework or individually, students can earn Bloomberg Market Concepts and the Bloomberg Environmental, Social, & Governance certifications and gain a deeper understanding of how businesses operate in the global economy—and how they implement strategies to become better corporate citizens.
