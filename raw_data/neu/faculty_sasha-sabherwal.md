#  SashaSabherwal
Assistant Professor of Cultural Anthropology and Global Asian Studies 
Sasha Sabherwal (she/her) is an interdisciplinary scholar of the South Asian diaspora with research interests in critical ethnic studies, the racialization of religion, transnational gender and sexuality studies, and the intersections of caste and race. She is currently at work on her first book, Cartographies of Caste in the Punjabi Sikh Diaspora of the Transnational Pacific Northwest, which explores caste dynamics across the United States and Canada. The project demonstrates that as caste travels, it is remade, oscillating between traditional caste hierarchies from the homeland and the contemporary diaspora. Her scholarly work can be found in Journal of Asian American Studies, Social Text, and Sikh Formations.
