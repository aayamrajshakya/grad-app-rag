##  Provincial Attestation Letters (PALs) 
Starting in 2024, the Government of Canada introduced the **Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL).** For more details, visit the [Government of Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents/provincial-attestation-letter.html). 
If you are applying to study at one of Northeastern University’s Canadian campuses, you will need to submit a PAL along with your **Proof of Acceptance (POA)** when applying for a study permit. 
Students who **applied for their study permit using an offer from a Northeastern University Canadian campus before January 22, 2025 whose study permit application is still in process, are exempt** from the PAL requirement. 
You can only use each PAL once. If your study permit application is refused, you cannot reuse the same PAL. You must apply for your study permit before the expiration date on your PAL. 
**_Important Note_** _: You will receive updates about your admission and PAL offer at the personal email address you used when applying to Northeastern. If you are selected for a PAL, the deposit instructions will be sent to your_[ _Northeastern student email_](https://northeastern.my.site.com/GraduateAdmissionsFAQ/s/article/How-do-I-set-up-a-myNEU-account) _._

#### **To be considered for a PAL, you must complete the enrolment form on your application portal.**
  * All updates regarding your admission offer will be sent to your personal email (the one you used to apply) from the NU Admissions/Enrolment team and will be available on your application portal. 
  * Once the enrolment form is successfully completed, your application will be reviewed to determine eligibility for a PAL. 
  * If you are selected for a PAL, you will be advised in your application portal and you will be issued an invoice for the PAL deposit.
  * The PAL confirmation letter in your application portal is NOT YOUR PAL letter. The PAL will only be issued after you have paid the deposit. 
  * Please only pay the deposit using the link in the invoice. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER PAYMENT using any other payment method or portal. If you do, your deposit may not be credited correctly to your account and your PAL will not be issued. 
  * Your PAL should be available within two (2) weeks of your deposit being received by the school. Please note that it can take a few days for your payment to be forwarded to the school by the third party payment company. For international students who reside within Canada, you must confirm your existing permit status with OGS team before a PAL can be issued. Please monitor your email for communications from OGS after you have paid the deposit.

**Study Permit Refusals**
  * If you were given a PAL and were refused your study permit application with that PAL, you will need to inform OGS Canada of your refusal and we will provide the next steps to initiate your PAL deposit refund. Please submit this [Study Permit Application Status Update Form](https://myogs.northeastern.edu/istart/controllers/client/ClientEngine.cfm?serviceid=EFormGroupProvider&eformGroup=61) to submit your refusal letter and initiate next steps.


  * You will need to provide OGS Canada with a copy of your refusal letter from IRCC along with the Global Case Management System (GCMS) notes or Officer Decision Notes (ODN) from the Immigration Officer. 
    * If you did not received Officer Decision Notes with your refusal letter, OGS Canada can assist in obtaining the GCMS Notes with your consent, free of charge. Once you submit your refusal letter, you will receive an email with next steps on how to authorize us to request your notes for you.
    * If you received the Officer Decision Notes (ODN) with your refusal letter, you will be prompted to upload this when you submit your refusal letter using the above form.


  * Your PAL deposit will be refunded upon providing the copy of your refusal letter. You do not need to take additional steps to request a refund.


  * At this time, a new PAL cannot be issued for the same intake, so you will need to request to defer your program start date, if your program allows deferrals, and you have not exceeded the allowed deferral time period.


  * Please work with OGS Canada to provide all the necessary documents to be considered for another PAL after study permit refusal.
  * If you have any questions please reach out to OGS Canada through [this inquiry form](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs?id=ogs_ask_a_question&sys_id=47cb95e387e1759011b72fc5dabb3512).


**You will need to connect with the Admissions team using your application portal, to make request to defer to the next intake for your program. You can also discuss your options to select a different campus of study, if that is available to you.**
