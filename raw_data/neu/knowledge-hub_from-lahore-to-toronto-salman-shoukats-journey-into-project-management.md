Salman Shoukat’s journey from Pakistan to Canada is one of growth, both personally and professionally. A native of Lahore, Salman transitioned from an electrical engineering background to pursuing a [master’s in project management](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-project-management-cps/master-of-science-in-project-management-toronto/) at Northeastern University’s [Toronto campus](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/global-campus-network/toronto-campus/). His story is about embracing new opportunities, overcoming challenges, and developing the skills needed to succeed in a global environment.
## Choosing a new path
After completing his bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in Lahore, Salman began looking for a different career path. He wanted to build on his technical knowledge while developing management skills that could open up new opportunities.
“When I completed my bachelor’s in electrical engineering, I found that we have [a] wide range of project management jobs throughout the world. I thought that I should combine my technical skills with management skills so I can be a better person and find a better job.”
This blend of skills—technical expertise, leadership, and project management—became Salman’s focus as he began his master’s degree at Northeastern.
### Why Toronto?
Salman was drawn to Canada, specifically Toronto, for the city’s diversity and vibrant cultural landscape. For an [international student](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/international-students/), Toronto offered an environment where he could find connections and feel at home.
“In Toronto, you can find every culture. It is a very diverse environment over there, and people here are very good. I have friends from India, Iran, China, Korea, and that diverse environment helps me a lot.”
Toronto’s international community played a significant role in Salman’s decision to study there, offering both professional opportunities and a sense of belonging.
### Building leadership and communication skills
One of the key areas where Salman saw personal growth during his time at Northeastern was in leadership and communication. Coming from Pakistan, he felt he lacked confidence in these areas, and his time at Northeastern helped him develop these essential skills.
Salman attributes much of this growth to the campus’ supportive faculty and the practical, hands-on learning environment. He’s proud of the person he’s becoming—someone who can confidently present ideas and lead teams in a diverse workplace.

## Co-op: preparing for the real world
As part of his Northeastern journey, Salman began a co-op at Novation Technology, an opportunity that excited him. The [co-op program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/academics-outcomes/our-learning-model/experiential-learning/), a key feature of Northeastern’s experiential learning model, helps students apply what they’ve learned to real-world settings.
“The staff and faculty at Northeastern helped me a lot to find a very good co-op opportunity. They taught me how to build my resumé, present myself in interviews, and write a good cover letter. These small things matter a lot.”
For Salman, the co-op was more than just a chance to work—it was a stepping stone to future success. He knows the experience played a valuable role in growing his professional network and honing the skills he developed during his studies.
### Looking to the future
Before graduation, Salman felt ready for the next chapter in his career. The combination of technical skills from his engineering background and the management skills he’s acquired through Northeastern’s project management program has given him confidence in his future prospects.
“After my co-op, I’m excited to see the differences in myself. Northeastern has helped me grow, and I’m ready for the next step.”
Salman’s journey from Lahore to Toronto has been one of personal and professional growth, and he’s eager to continue building on the skills and experiences he’s gained throughout his time at Northeastern.
