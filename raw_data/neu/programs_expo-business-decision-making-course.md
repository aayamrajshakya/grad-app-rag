A successful business leader is resilient above all else, and the best way to beef up resilience is through developing and applying skills in a real-world experience. In this intensive seven-week course in our Online MBA program, you'll solve real business challenges by adopting the role of a C-suite executive and tackling an issue from a 360-degree perspective. 
You'll work as part of an ad hoc leadership team to answer a high-level question for a leading company—immersing completely in a complex challenge and interacting with faculty, classmates, and experienced C-suite executives as you chart a unique solution.
> You'll benefit from the full power of Northeastern's faculty, resources, and business network all in one challenging, highly immersive project. This experience can make you more resilient, more productive, and more valuable to your company from day one. I think you'll also find the lessons you learn apply not just professionally, but personally.
