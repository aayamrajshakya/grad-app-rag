#  OliviaOrdoñez
Assistant Teaching Professor, English 
Olivia Ordoñez’s research examines the ways in which individuals and communities engage in dialogue across differences in sociopolitical location, such as race, gender, disability, and economic status. In particular, she assesses, with an eye toward affordances and limitations, extant, socially prominent ways of engaging with Black feminist art, with particular attention to intercultural interactions; illustrates how these methods shape and are shaped by currently available political responses to injustice; and encourages more dialogic modes of interaction across difference.
As a teacher, she is committed to fostering community, preparing students for the difficult but vital work of forming meaningful social and political connections with individuals both like and unlike themselves, and guiding them toward modes of expression that not only allow them to become powerful advocates but also to consider and engage with audiences from various backgrounds.
