The LEADERs Program is a new experiential learning initiative that integrates leadership and professional skills education with a research project linked to a Northeastern postdoc’s existing research assignment. The program—Leadership Education Advancing Discovery through Embedded Research—enriches the postdoc’s own research as they address the real-world needs of enterprises in fields from STEM to the social sciences and humanities.
