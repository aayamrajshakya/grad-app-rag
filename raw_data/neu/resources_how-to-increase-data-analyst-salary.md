Most successful [data analysts](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/what-does-a-data-analyst-do/) have to wear many hats. Organizations in virtually all industries increasingly rely on data to drive the decision-making process and identify business inefficiencies that need to be addressed.
“Analytics professionals are like a Swiss army knife,” says Paul Wallenberg, unit manager of tech services at IT recruiting firm [LaSalle Network](https://www.thelasallenetwork.com/). “They’re not just a subset of IT, they’re embedded in departments across the company. These skills and roles set you apart from IT because they give you the fluidity to bounce between departments, making you more marketable and valuable.”
There’s good news for these professionals in the analytics field: Job opportunities are growing. In fact, experts now predict that more than 150 zettabytes of data will need analysis by 2025, creating thousands of analytics jobs within a wide range of industries. Professionals who understand how to leverage this data to help organizations make better business decisions will be in high demand—and command high salaries—for years to come.
## Data Analytics Job Market and Salary Trends
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, analytics jobs will grow by [about 31 percent](https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/fastest-growing-occupations.htm) by 2030—much faster than average. This growth is driven in part by an increasing number of businesses launching AI initiatives, adopting Big Data technologies, and prioritizing data in decision making.
But finding qualified individuals to fill these roles isn’t easy. These professionals are responsible for helping organizations make sense of their technical data in order for executives to make better business decisions, and that requires a unique skill set, which combines technical savvy with business knowledge.
Per LinkedIn, there has been a 650 percent increase in data science jobs since 2012—and on average, these roles take longer to fill than the national average, given the specialized nature of the work. This industry need, coupled with the shortage of qualified talent, means data analysts are well compensated. According to [Robert Half Technology’s 2022 Salary Report](https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide/specialization/technology), these professionals earn between $87,500 and $126,250 on average, depending on their experience, education, and skill set. For more advanced roles, salaries become much higher.

## Highest Paying Industries For Data Analysts
While there is a need for data analysts in nearly all industries, some fields are experiencing higher demand—and increasingly competitive compensation standards—for[ skilled data professionals](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analyst-skills/). According to RHT’s Salary Guide, the top industries hiring for these roles in 2022 are:
  * Financial services
  * Healthcare
  * High-tech
  * Professional services
  * Retail and e-commerce


To maximize your earning potential, career experts suggest that you focus on four areas: mastering today’s in-demand data skills, considering an advanced degree, seeking extra experience, and knowing the range in which your salary lies.
## 4 Ways to Increase Your Data Analyst Salary
### 1. Master the necessary skills.
The skills that are in demand today aren’t always the ones that will be in demand tomorrow. That’s why it’s important to keep tabs on industry trends and make sure you’re up to date on the latest skills, says John Reed, senior executive director at RHT.
In 2022, experience with skills like data mining, statistical and quantitative analysis, multivariate testing, and predictive modeling can increase your marketability—and your salary—significantly.
Acquiring additional programming skills—particularly R and Python—can also increase your earning potential, says Blake Angove, director of technology services at IT recruiting firm [LaSalle Network](http://www.lasallenetwork.com).
“When you have in-demand skills, you’re in a better position to ask for higher pay,” Reed says. “Your degree can certainly give you a lot of knowledge and [skills needed as a data analyst](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/data-analyst-skills/) through math, computer science, data modeling courses, and more. And if you’d like to expand your skill set, consider taking an [online course](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/graduate-certificate-in-data-analytics-online-5241/).”

### 2. Pursue an advanced degree or certificate.
Businesses are having a difficult time finding qualified individuals with the right mix of skills, training, experience, and education, which is why salaries for these professionals are so competitive.
Entry-level data analysts typically earn a bachelor’s degree from science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields, but pursuing an advanced degree can fast-track you to a promotion and higher salary, Angove says. In fact, 39 percent of advanced analytics jobs require a master’s degree or PhD, [according to IBM](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/3RL3VXGA).
Seek out a program with a focus on math, science, databases, programming, modeling, and predictive analytics, he suggests. Northeastern offers a[ Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-business-analytics-boston-18309/) for example, which equips students with a deep understanding of the mechanics of working with data, along with the capacity to identify and communicate data-driven insights that influence decision-making.
Students in Northeastern’s STEM-designated program gain exposure to data mining, statistical and quantitative analysis, multivariate testing, and predictive modeling, and learn to use tools including Python, R, SPSS, SQL, and Tableau—all skills that increase their marketability and mobility.
“There’s a definite trend in obtaining formal degrees in analytics,” says Paul Wallenberg, unit manager of tech services at IT recruiting firm [LaSalle Network](https://thelasallenetwork.com/). “If you’re interested in perhaps marketing yourself as a data scientist down the road, for example, having a master’s or even a PhD is highly preferred, especially at top-tier organizations, which pay the highest.”
### 3. Seek extra experience.
Whether you’re considering a graduate degree or are already enrolled in a master’s program, there are steps you can take now to boost your earning potential, RHT’s John Reed says. To begin, gain hands-on experience through internships or project-based roles while you’re in school to build up your resumé.
“These experiences can help you earn a higher salary as a new tech professional since you’ll already have some of the skills and knowledge needed,” he says.
Research companies and job openings in your area and network with industry professionals to see what opportunities are available. With more real experience and tangible projects, employers may boost your salary.
“One of the best ways to increase salary is to show an employer how you’ve brought value to a previous employer or project,” Reed adds.
Additionally, becoming involved in your local analytics community is a great way to get more visibility, which could lead to inquiries from head hunters with jobs that could boost your salary, Wallenberg says.
He suggests researching local groups on the networking site [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/). “If you’re involved in a Hadoop, R, or Python MeetUp group in your city, you’ll probably connect with people who can help you land higher-paying jobs,” he says.
Other sites to connect with others on [GitHub](https://github.com/), an open-source development platform, and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), an online community for developers.
### 4. Don’t sell yourself short.
If you’re already employed as a data analyst and are seeking a promotion or increase in pay, arm yourself for that conversation with your manager. There are a variety of salary calculators and resources available to check how your compensation stacks up in the market, including [Salary.com](https://www.salary.com/), [PayScale](https://www.payscale.com/), and RHT ’s annual [Salary Guide](https://www.roberthalf.com/salary-guide/specialization/technology).
These resources are essential to have the most productive conversations with hiring managers, Reed says. “If you find you need to negotiate for higher pay, present your research during a salary discussion with your potential or current employer in order to help strengthen your case. Understanding what your industry peers in your geographic location are making is extremely important to know if your compensation is up to par.”
