Reliance agreements are often needed when a Northeastern project also involves non-Northeastern collaborators. These agreements extend Northeastern’s Federal Wide Assurance (FWA) to cover study team members who are not Northeastern employees. Please use the [Northeastern University Reliance Flowchart ](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Northeastern-University-IRB-Reliance-Flowchart.pdf)to help you determine which reliance pathway you might want to use. If you have any questions, please reach out to [[email protected]](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e9a0bbabbb8c858088878a8ca987869b9d818c889a9d8c9b87c78c8d9c).
Please see below for an overview of when each process applies and how to request a reliance agreement using that process.
##### Note that most federally funded multi-site research is subject to the Single IRB Mandate that requires reliance agreements unless an exemption applies. Please see below for details about the sIRB mandate and exemptions.
Process to request NU serve as the reviewing sIRB: 
For non-exempt research, NU will serve as the IRB of record for US based institutions which have a FWA on file. For non-NU collaborators who are notwithout
Relying sites can be added either during the initial review or by submitting a modification to an existing NU IRB approved study. If submitting a modification, be sure to complete the modification form. See the [Forms](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/forms-guidance/forms/) page for forms/templates used in the initial review and modification process.
To add a relying site, there are two processes that need to converge:
1. Submission of intake materials
  * A completed [NU IRB of Record Intake Form](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NU-IRB-of-Record-Relying-Site-Intake-Form-10.25.2023.docx) for each site that will be relying on us.
  * A completed [Reliance Plan Form](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Multi-site-Review-Plan-10.25.2023.docx) listing all sites (including sites that will not rely on us for any reason).
  * A protocol document that describes the activities non-NU collaborators will conduct / that is consistent with their involvement. If any other study documents should reflect non-NU collaborators, ensure these are consistent as well. A relying site can be added during initial review. However, if the process to add a relying site is occurring after approval, a modification will need to be submitted via a [Modification form](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Modification-Form-07.18.2023.docx) along with all modified and new documents needed.


2. Execution of the reliance agreement. 
SMART IRBThe study team (either NU or external) will need to create the request in SMART IRB. Please see the Reliance Walkthrough Video here for more information about the SMART IRB process: <https://smartirb.org/reliance/> . Each institution will sign off using the SMART platform and the investigator will receive an email when the agreement is executed. |  IAAPlease submit a completed IAA Template: NU IRB of Record that is signed by the relying institution. When the study or amendment is ready for approval, the NU IO will countersign and NU HRPP will return the executed agreement with the approval packet. If the relying institution requests that NU sign first, please explain so when submitting.

Find forms/templates used at the bottom right of this page. If you require an IAA template, please contact [[email protected]](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0148534353646d68606f6264416f6e7375696460727564736f2f646574).
Process to request NU defer review to an external sIRB: 
For non-exempt research, NU is willing to enter into a reliance agreement to defer review to an IRB of record at a US based institution which has a FWA on file. The NU IRB will only enter into reliance agreements for studies that are already approved by the reviewing IRB unless there are unique circumstances that require consideration. Please email [[email protected]](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0a435848586f66636b64696f4a6465787e626f6b797e6f7864246f6e7f) to discuss any such circumstances.
To request that NU defer review to an external sIRB:
1. NU Local Context Forms and Study Materials[[email protected]](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#723b203020171e1b131c1117321c1d00061a1713010617001c5c171607)
  * A completed [NU Relying – Reliance Intake Form](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NU-Relying-Reliance-Intake-Form-10.25.2023.docx)
  * A completed [NU Relying – Reliance Research Team Form](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/NU-Relying-Research-Team-Form-10.25.2023.docx) (be sure to list the NU PI on this form)
  * Copies of the sIRB approval letter, the approved protocol, approved consent forms, and copies of any other documents reviewed and approved by the sIRB.
  * If the reviewing IRB requires copies of any forms to be completed by the NU IRB, please submit those as well.


2. Execution of the reliance agreement. 
SMART IRBIf the reviewing IRB will use the SMART online platform, the study team (either NU or external) will need to create the request in SMART IRB. Please see the Reliance Walkthrough Video here for more information about the SMART IRB process: [smartirb.org/reliance/](https://smartirb.org/reliance/) . Each institution will sign off using the SMART platform and the investigator will receive an email when the agreement is executed. If the reviewing IRB will use a SMART Letter of Authorization instead of the SMART online platform, please send that letter along with your intake materials. For more information, please see Letter of Acknowledgement, Template under [smartirb.org/resources/.](https://smartirb.org/resources/) |  IAA or other “Paper” agreementPlease submit a completed IAA form that is signed by the sIRB. When the study or amendment is ready for approval, the NU IO will countersign and NU HRPP will return the executed agreement with the approval packet. If the sIRB requests that NU sign first, please explain so when submitting.  
---|---  
Please note that if the reviewing sIRB requires any agreements with unusual terms or addendums to the standard or typical terms of reliance, the agreement may require additional review by NU OGC.
Find forms/templates used at the bottom right of this page. If you require an IAA template, please contact reliance.
Process for Individual Investigator Agreements (IIA): 
Individual Investigator Agreements (IIAs) are used when collaborators are engaged in research on their own behalf (i.e. as an independent investigator) or when the collaborator is not affiliated with a US based institution with a FWA on file (i.e. they do not have their own IRB). IIAs are often used when a project includes collaborators from local clinics or schools that do not have an IRB or non-academic community member collaborators.
Collaborators can be added either during the initial review or by submitting a modification to an existing NU IRB approved study. See the [Forms](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/forms-guidance/forms/) page for forms/templates used in the initial review and modification process.
To add an investigator via an IIA, submit:
  1. A completed Research Team Form listing each non-NU collaborator.
  2. A protocol document that describes the activities non-NU collaborators will conduct / that is consistent with their involvement. If any other study documents should reflect non-NU collaborators, ensure these are consistent as well.
  3. Submit a completed Individual Investigator Agreement form signed by each non-NU collaborator. Please reach out to your assigned reviewer for a copy of this.
  4. Ensure each non-NU collaborator has current IRB CITI training. Note that non-NU investigators can register at citiprogram.org as a NU affiliate. [Please review the guide on how to do so](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NU-IRB-CITI-training%E2%80%A8for-external-affilaites.pdf).


Once submitted, the study will be reviewed using our normal review processes. Once the study materials are ready for approval, the IIA will be sent (internally) to an institutional official for signature and, once the IIA is signed, the study will be approved and a signed copy of the IIA will be sent to the PI and Lead Student alongside with the IRB approval packet.
For more information about IIA, please see <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/forms/individual-investigator-agreement/index.html>
Download the [Template IIA Form here](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Northeastern-University-IIA-Template.docx).
Process for Exempt Multi-site Research 
The NU IRB does not enter into reliance agreements or establish IIAs for exempt research, except when unique circumstances prompt for an exception. Barring an exception, the NU IRB will not extend IRB review and oversight to non-NU investigators on Exempt research. Non-NU collaborators are expected to adhere to any non-NU requirements that pertain to their participation in the project. In most cases, this means the non-NU collaborator will submit an independent submission to their own IRB.
For NU investigators collaborating on non-NU exempt research, please submit for an exemption determination. Note that the protocol should reflect only the NU researchers’ scope of work – activities conducted by non-NU researchers can be included for context, but we are not reviewing and providing approval for those activities. Include any non-NU IRB approvals, consent forms, etc, for context when you submit.
For projects where NU is the prime on a grant and all activities will be conducted by another institution, please see “When NU is prime on a grant but not Involved in the exempt research” below.
What is a reliance agreement? 
When conducting multi-site research, each institution typically has its own Institutional Review Board (IRB) responsible for ensuring ethical standards are met. An IRB reliance agreement is a formal agreement between two or more institutions engaged in research. The agreement allows one institution’s IRB (relying institution) to defer aspects of the IRB review to another institution’s IRB (reviewing institution). The reviewing institution’s IRB will oversee many aspects of the research protocol on behalf of the relying institution. This process is intended to streamline IRB review across all participating institutions. A reliance agreement will define institutional roles, responsibilities, and procedures for oversight.
When do I need or when can I use a reliance agreement? 
Reliance agreements for non-federally funded projects
The NU IRB recommends establishing reliance agreements for any non-exempt collaborative research with US-based institutions who have a FWA on file.
NIH sIRB Requirements:
Effective Jan 25, 2018, the NIH established the expectation that a (sIRB) will review non-exempt human subjects research protocols funded by the NIH that are carried out at more than one site in the United States unless the study qualifies for an exception. The policy can be found here: <https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-16-094.html> .
NIH also has provided guidance on when projects require sIRB and what exemptions might apply here: <https://grants.nih.gov/sites/default/files/sIRB-Determination-workflow.pdf>
Common Rule sIRB Requirement:
Effective Jan 20, 2020, the revised common rule requires all non-exempt cooperative research conducted or supported by a Federal department or agency rely upon a sIRB unless the research qualifies for an exception. Details policy can be found here: <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/single-irb-exception-determinations/index.html>
Who can serve as a sIRB? 
Often the lead site is responsible for selecting the sIRB for federally funded cooperative research. In non-funded research, this role often goes to the institution/site developing the research protocol. At Northeastern, there are three options for who can serve as a sIRB:
IRB of one of the institutions involved:
Commercial IRB: 
Other Central IRB: 
When is Northeastern engaged in research? 
There are several criteria for determining whether an institution is or is not engaged in human subjects research. Please see the [Engagement Worksheet](https://dhr.research.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Engagement-Worksheet-4.19.2024.docx) for guidance on determining whether NU is or is not engaged in human subjects research.
Relevant guidance includes:
For general activities, please see HHS engagement guidance for determining when an institution is engaged and exceptions: <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-engagement-of-institutions/index.html>
When is a non-NU site engaged in research? 
Non-NU sites and investigators are responsible for determining whether they are or are not engaged in research. Please see HHS engagement guidance for determining when an institution is engaged and exceptions: <https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-engagement-of-institutions/index.html>
What approvals do I need to use NU resources or conduct research at NU when NU isn't engaged? 
If NU is not engaged in human subjects research, no NU IRB oversight is required. Researchers will need to work with departments and ensure their activities are consistent with non-NU policies.
Should I use SMART IRB, an IAA, or a different process? 
We encourage investigators to use SMART IRB whenever possible. The platform streamlines the reliance process for all parties. The IAA process is older and requires signatures from the Institutional Official which can add additional time to the review process.
Before deciding on a process, you should check with any non-NU IRBs to confirm that they are willing to use SMART IRB or an IAA. Some institutions do not use SMART IRB or have different processes. If the non-NU IRB requires a different process, please explain so during the NU review process. NU is flexible and able to use most reliance agreement processes as long as the agreement doesn’t not contain any terms or stipulations the university feels it is unable to agree to. For IRBs who don’t want to use SMART IRB, please reach out to those IRBs to obtain copies of any forms/agreements they would like to use to execute the reliance agreement.
## 4 Types of Agreements:
### IRB Authorization Agreements IAAs
An IAA is a document signed by signatory officials at two institutions that establishes an agreement to defer review of one or more studies to another institution’s IRB. Typically, an IRB has its own template IAA template they prefer to use. NU can provide an IAA upon request, but prefers to use SMART IRB or the site’s template. Review by the NU OGC may be required if the IAA has contractual or legal terms. The template will be signed by one institution then sent to the second institution for the second signature/execution. Research teams are responsible for routing the documents to the appropriate signature officials.
### SMART IRB
SMART IRB is an online IRB reliance platform designed to harmonize and streamline the IRB review process for multisite studies. This online reliance system allows research teams to submit requests for a reliance agreement that can replace the need for Institutional Authorization Agreements (IAAs). Research teams are responsible for submitting the initial request/responding to any revisions needed and SMART IRB uses an online workflow where the request will automatically be routed between IRBs.
### SMART Letter of Acknowledgement (LOA)
A SMART IRB Letter of Acknowledgement (LOA) allows research teams to utilize a paper or e-document to execute reliance agreements under the terms of the SMART IRB master reliance agreement without using the SMART IRB online platform. This document follows a similar process as an IAA.
### Memorandums of Understanding or Master Agreements
Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), also known as Master Agreements, establish a permanent and standing arrangement between entities which can cover any number of research projects (as opposed to being limited to one or a few specific projects). These agreements are often used by large reliance networks or to establish larger institutional collaborations. Developing and finalizing MOUs is a time-intensive process, often spanning several months and a MOU will be part of a much larger process establishing the collaboration. MOUs are institution driven rather than investigator initiated.
How do I use SMART IRB? 
To begin the process of establishing IRB reliance through the SMART IRB Online Reliance System, you will need to [log in to the system](https://reliance.smartirb.org/) and create and submit a reliance request. You may need to create a new account by [requesting investigator access](https://reliance.smartirb.org/users/sign_up) if this is your first time using this system. There are some instructional videos at <https://smartirb.org/reliance/>, including one describing how an investigator submits a request, which may be helpful.
Who provides IRB review when a researcher has a dual appointment? 
In situations where a researcher is affiliated with more than one institution, it is important to delineate what roles they are conducting the research activity under. Occasionally, the nature of the research aligns with only one of these positions, while in other instances, it may be relevant to both. When it remains ambiguous whether a researcher is engaged in research as an agent of an institution, it is recommended they consult with the respective IRBs of each institution. The IRB at each institution assumes the responsibility of determining whether a researcher is conducting research as a representative of their specific institution. The NU IRB does not and cannot make these determinations on the behalf of other institutions. When submitting, be sure to clearly explain how you arrived at any determinations.
If a researcher is engaged in research as an agent of two institutions, both IRBs will need to provide oversight OR one IRB will need to defer review to the other via a reliance agreement.
The NU IRB follows [DHHS engagement guidance](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/guidance/guidance-on-engagement-of-institutions/index.html) when making these determinations.
When NU is prime on a grant but not Involved in the exempt research 
When NU is the Prime recipient or Primary Awardee of a federal grant, where a subrecipient institution or organization will conduct only exempt human subjects, and NU will not be involved in any human subjects research activities, we ask that NU investigators provide us with the following information via email:
  1. Copies of the materials from the external IRB. This includes their exemption determination letter, copies of any protocols, copies of any content materials, etc.
  2. A list identifying the sponsor, grant number, and NU PI on the grant.
  3. Confirm that no one at NU will be: interacting with participants, obtaining consent, contacting participants, collecting data/information from or about participants, or analyzing identifiable (or coded) data.
  4. Confirm that no NU investigators will access identifiable data. OHRP considers private information or specimens to be individually identifiable as defined in 45 CFR 46.102(f) when they can be linked to specific individuals by the investigator(s) either directly or indirectly through coding systems.


Once this information is received and confirmed, the DHR will review and acknowledge the external exemption determination. If 3 or 4 cannot be acknowledged, the activity may require review by the NU IRB.
This process is important as it allows us to verify proper oversight and have records of the activity as the prime on the grant. NU research teams are encouraged to save these materials (and correspondence with the DHR) for their own records as well.
Note: this process only applies to exempt research where the activity is exempt at all sites. Non-exempt sponsored research typically requires a reliance agreement due to federal engagement regulations.
What are my expectations as a local study team? 
Investigators should be aware that reliance arrangements frequently require additional work on the part of the local study team, including submission to the NU IRB and the external IRB, as well as managing communication between these offices.
Furthermore, the NU’s DHR must have a current record of all research team personnel associated with the protocol. An updated research team form is to be submitted anytime a Northeastern investigator is added or removed from the study.
If the reliance request was initiated after the reviewing IRB approved the study, the addition of sites and/or collaborators will need to be specifically reviewed and approved, via a modification to the existing study.
What if a reliance agreement required indemnification language? 
Any reliance agreement containing indemnification language will be referred to the Office of General Counsel for review and approval prior to finalizing the agreement.
What does my student working on human subjects research projects at another institution need to do? 
Northeastern students often work with other institutions to conduct research. This might include, for example, a co-op at another Boston area college that involves conducting research there. When this occurs, it is necessary to determine if NU IRB oversight is required. Students should work with their faculty advisors and/or mentors to determine whether or not Northeastern IRB oversight or a reliance agreement
Step 1: Are you acting as an agent of Northeastern?
When Northeastern students conduct research at another institution (e.g., in collaboration with that institution or using its facilities, participants, or data), they must disentangle if they are acting
Step 2: If you are an agent of Northeastern, is Northeastern engaged in the research?
If a NU student is acting as an agent of Northeastern, we must next determine if Northeastern is engaged. In general, NU is engaged if that student will be interacting with participants or using identifiable data. However, there are two specific carve outs that makes Northeastern not engaged:
  1. Northeastern University agents:


  * obtain coded
  * are unable to readily ascertain the identity of the subjects to whom the coded information or specimens pertain because the institution’s employees or agents and the holder of the key enter into an agreement prohibiting the release of the key to the those employees or agents under any circumstances;


  1. Northeastern University agents access or utilize individually identifiable private information only while visiting an institution that is engaged in the research, provided their research activities are overseen by the IRB of the institution that is engaged in the research.


Step 3: If Northeastern is engaged, who will review?
If NU is engaged in the research, NU IRB oversight is required. Depending on the circumstances, this may mean:
  * Direct NU IRB review
  * A reliance agreement


The appropriate path depends on where the research takes place, which institution has primary responsibility, and whether reliance mechanisms (e.g., SMART IRB, IAA) are available. You should consult with your faculty mentors and the study PI on how to navigate which review pathway is most appropriate.
