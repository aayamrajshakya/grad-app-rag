## Advance your career with in-demand international business skills 
As the global marketplace becomes increasingly connected and interdependent, organizations need leaders who understand the legal and logistical implications of international business, possess the cross-cultural skills to navigate any market, and have the future-focused perspectives to capitalize on advancing technologies. 
The International Business concentration will prepare you with an understanding of global competitive strategies and leadership skills that translate across borders—from economics to trade policies to politics to currencies.

> In today's world, cultural agility is more important than ever. At Northeastern, we have people from all different backgrounds, countries, and cultures. International business resonated with me because companies are so multinational now. I'll experience working with people from different cultures and backgrounds, and it's essential to know how to approach people when cultural differences exist.
