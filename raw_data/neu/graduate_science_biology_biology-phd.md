## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The PhD program entails course work from a core biology curriculum along with advanced courses in the student’s area of research interest. This is complemented by intensive research and completion of a dissertation under faculty supervision. Faculty research includes biochemistry, microbiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, neurobiology, regenerative biology, and the biology of reproduction. Two optional concentrations are available: cell and molecular biology and molecular microbiology.

The biology PhD program seeks to provide a broad background knowledge base in conjunction with in-depth study of a specialized area of biology. The program emphasizes close interaction between graduate students and faculty members in developing the intellectual and experimental skills required for creative, independent research.
Students entering the PhD program with a related Master of Science degree typically have significantly reduced course loads. An individualized course of study is designed by the biology graduate curriculum committee in consultation with the student and the student’s advisor. The student can then focus on intensive research and completion of a dissertation under faculty supervision. Faculty research includes biochemistry, microbiology, cell and molecular biology, genetics, neurobiology, regenerative biology, and the biology of reproduction. Financial support (teaching assistantships or research assistantships) is normally provided for PhD students who are making satisfactory progress toward completion of their degree.
