### Cooperative Education (Co-op)
All Graduate CSSH Masters programs will offer an optional [cooperative education experience](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/academics/co-op/#grad) (“co-op”) to eligible students.
Northeastern’s signature co-op ecosystem provides qualified masters students with six-month research and work experiences in businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies in Boston and across the United States. Graduate students take their work from campus learning spaces, apply it outside of the classroom in a variety of environments, and then bring that knowledge and those skills back to our campus learning spaces during the one-credit Experiential Integration course.
To learn more, interested masters students should first meet with their Graduate Program Director to determine eligibility and where co-op will fit within the student’s curriculum.
