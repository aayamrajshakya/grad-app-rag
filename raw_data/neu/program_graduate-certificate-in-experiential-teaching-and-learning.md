The coursework in this graduate certificate program explores the theoretical foundations, approaches, and strategies for learning through experience and how to apply these competencies with a commitment toward fostering educational equity through reflection, analysis, and action.
Experiential learning has been proven to be a highly effective pedagogy for multiple reasons:

  * leads to increased student engagement and learning outcomes
  * has been shown to increase equity and close the achievement gap
  * promotes social emotional growth, student agency and self-authorship

### Program objectives
  * Develop skills needed to lead both student and adult experiential learning
  * Provides educators the ability to design, measure, and evaluate practices that lead to changes in student engagement and outcomes
  * Apply these competencies toward fostering educational equity through reflection, analysis, and action.
