The Master of Science in Telecommunication Networks is designed for professionals currently in the telecommunications or networking field who either wish to enhance their technical skills and credentials or who wish to make a transition to the business side of telecommunications or networking. We also welcome applications from prospective students with limited industry experience. This program, which may be pursued on a full- or part-time basis, is one of only a very few master’s programs in telecommunications and networking in the United States that is truly multidisciplinary, giving students the flexibility to tailor the curriculum to their specific interests, backgrounds, and career goals.
## Degree Requirements
Students in the program must complete 32 semester hours of approved coursework with a minimum grade-point average of 3.000. Students can complete a master's degree by pursuing any of one of the three options: coursework, project, or thesis. Although there are some dependencies among the core courses, the program may be started in either the fall or spring semester. The three core courses each carry 4 semester hours of credit.
Master's project and thesis options must be carried out under the supervision of a professor and must have prior approval of the program director. Proposals for a master's project or a thesis need to be submitted at least one month before the start of the semester.
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
