2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Professional Studies in Applied Logistics is built to prepare students to be agile in the changing warehousing and distribution industry. As a central pillar of the program, students will study how to handle challenges that arise quickly and develop leadership and project management skills to help communicate to customers, avoid reactionary responses, work collaboratively to find a solution, and to effectively communicate across the supply chain and with customers. By integrating systems thinking with training in the technical applications in logistics, students will gain well-rounded experience that allows them to understand and adapt to strategic imperatives while also being able to execute in detail. The program aims to develop proficiency in descriptive analytics and the use of real-time data to optimize routing among distribution centers and fulfill orders in response to changing customer profiles, shifting product sales, disruptions in the supplier network, and customer demand for packaging changes.
