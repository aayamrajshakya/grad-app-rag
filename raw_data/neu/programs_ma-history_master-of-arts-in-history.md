World history 
Learn to think comparatively and transnationally. You’ll focus on historical themes that span the globe, exploring histories of trade, migration, the environment, state formation, colonialism, and other themes that intersect and connect disparate parts of the globe.
Public history
Prepare to apply your intellectual training to apply history outside of the classroom, considering issues, methods, and questions faced in historical societies, museums, archives, documentary film production, and other cultural and historical organizations.
Career outlook 
Graduates of Northeastern’s master’s programs in both world history and public history have gone on to work in a range of academic programs and fields around the country.
Graduates who have earned a master’s degree in public history are employed as editors at Harvard University Press, Bedford/St Martin’s Publishing and Houghton-Mifflin; as museum curators at the JFK Library, the Indiana Historical Society, and the Texas State Library; and as researchers at the New England Historic and Genealogical Society and the Adams National Historic Site.
