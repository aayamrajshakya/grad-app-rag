#  DanMetzger
Associate Teaching Professor in English; Director of First Year Writing 
Dan Metzger is a critical practitioner-researcher whose scholarship focuses on improving first-year student experience through gateway writing instruction. His research applies Black feminism and Foucauldian social theories to student experience and pedagogical practice, and explores how designing curricular components such as journaling on the transition to college allows students to interrogate power relationships in higher education and build agency as they enter college. Dan’s teaching and research focus on how our intersectional social identities affect our experiences as learners, and how we can use writing as an act of engaged citizenship to advance social equity.
Dan previously taught first-year writing at Northampton Community College in Bethlehem, PA. Prior to receiving his EdD in Transformational Teaching and Learning from Kutztown University (KU), he earned a BA in English from KU and a MA in English from the University of Massachusetts Boston, where he taught literature courses.

### [First-Year Writing ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engw/)
#### ENGW 1111
Designed for students to study and practice writing in a workshop setting. Students read a range of texts in order to describe and evaluate the choices writers make and apply that knowledge to their own writing and explore how writing functions in a range of academic, professional, and public contexts. Offers students an opportunity to learn how to conduct research using primary and secondary sources; how to write for various purposes and audiences in multiple genres and media; and how to give and receive feedback, to revise their work, and to reflect on their growth as writers.
