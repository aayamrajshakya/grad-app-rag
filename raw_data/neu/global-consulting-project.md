## Consult for a leading global firm—and strengthen your resumé 
3
elective credits
1
week of travel
4
months of consulting work
The best way to learn the nuances and challenges of a global business world is to experience it directly. Through a semester-long MBA elective course, you can work with a team of fellow students to solve a challenge for a real multinational firm—and add a significant consulting project to your resumé. You'll work directly with company leaders, building your cultural awareness and developing tech-forward, data-driven solutions that make a real impact. 
Your consulting engagement may involve almost any industry and may span several functional areas, including finance, marketing, and strategy. This course typically includes a week of international travel to one of our global employer partners, which have included such well-known names as Cisco Portugal and TJX Europe.
