## Partnerships in action
  * Creating a digital interface to explore genomics data
### Creating a digital interface to explore genomics data
Jackson Laboratory researchers who are studying genomics to better understand what causes disease needed a better way to search for and discover each other’s projects. JAX partnered with us to create a digital user experience that could help their researchers find, explore, compare, and share each other’s experimental findings and digital resources. A final prototype provided a framework for working with large amounts of experimental genomic data—helping JAX take a more effective approach to data searches, particularly by using visualizations. 
  * Co-developing technologies to keep our nation’s military safe and effective
### Co-developing technologies to keep our nation’s military safe and effective
The U.S. Army wanted a Northeast hub for its Army Research Lab where it could co-locate staff alongside other experts to develop defense technologies and bring them to the battlefield faster. The ARL selected our Kostas Research Institute for Homeland Security, with expertise in defense research and a proven track record of innovative partnerships with industry and academia. Research teams in Burlington, Massachusetts, and Arlington, Virginia, focus on cybersecurity and create tactical shelters, smart sensors, and nanomaterials for defense and other uses.
  * Creating meaningful, scalable impact in communities
### Creating meaningful, scalable impact in communities
Community policymakers need the expertise and resources to find policy solutions to long-standing problems in areas such as housing, workforce development, opioids, or crime. That’s why Northeastern researchers launched Community to Community, an Impact Accelerator that conducts research and builds long-term partnerships to advance data-driven policies that target local challenges. C2C’s year one successes include delivering executive ed workshops to policymakers and providing an algorithm to help equitably place 9,000 youth in Boston’s summer employment program.
