#### INTL 4700

Emphasizes Egypt, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Israel/Palestine, and Lebanon. From America’s first proselytizing adventure to the Ottoman Empire in 1820 to the embrace of Saudi Arabia in the 1940s to the overthrow of the democratically elected prime minister in Iran in 1953 to the attacks of September 11, 2001, to the invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 to America’s response to the “Arab Awakening” in 2011 and beyond, the course covers history, politics, oil, war, and peacemaking within the framework of U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
