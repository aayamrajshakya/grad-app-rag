# Global Co-op
Your co-op coordinator is your primary point-of-contact if you’re interested in doing a global co-op. As each college has slightly different processes, your co-op coordinator will guide you through all relevant next steps and connect you with the appropriate resources and on-campus offices to best support you.
The Global Experience Office supports students and co-op coordinators with a variety of services, which include pre-departure orientation, visa guidance, and support while abroad. After securing a global co-op placement, you will be responsible for completing the GEO Global Co-op requirements prior to departure. A Global Experience advisor will be in touch with you regarding visa support and pre-departure programming.
