## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Biology can inspire engineering. Increasingly, discoveries in the life sciences reveal processes, complexity, and control without analogy in the world of traditional engineering. Current methods of producing nanoscale control over molecules cannot reproduce the organization found in even the simplest organisms. Energy capture, robust control, remediation, and self-assembly are all employed by biosystems with efficiency unparalleled by anything in today’s laboratories. At the same time, traditional engineering disciplines struggle to find new approaches to the complex challenges of 21st-century technology. The last 50 years of basic life science research have gradually revealed the layers of complexity intrinsic to biological processes, unmasking the fundamental underpinnings on which biological systems are constructed. Bioinspired engineering has the potential to transform the technological landscape of the 21st century. Astonishingly, it represents merely one of the myriad opportunities presented at the interface of biology and engineering.
The field of bioengineering is broad and includes all research at the interface of engineering and biology—this includes bioprocesses, environmental microbiology, biomaterials and tissue engineering, bioelectricity, biomechanics, biomedical and biological imaging, nanotechnology in medicine and the environment, and engineering design for human interfacing. At Northeastern University, bioengineering PhD students have an opportunity to be trained to appreciate advances in bioengineering across a wide range of disciplines while they perform highly focused and cutting-edge bioengineering research with one of our faculty members.
The PhD in Bioengineering program reflects departmental research strengths in multiple areas. Students accepted to the bioengineering program will undertake a rigorous core curriculum in basic bioengineering science, followed by a flexible selection of electives tailored to their dissertation research. 
## Research Focus 
### Artificial Intelligence in Translational Healthcare at the Roux Institute (AI-TH@Roux)
Translational healthcare is a discipline of biomedical research that seeks to improve the health of individuals and communities by translating research findings into diagnostic tools, medicine, and other therapies. Artificial Intelligence in Translational Healthcare at the Roux Institute uses methods of high-performance computing, data science, and modeling to achieve these goals. AI-TH@Roux builds on core research strengths at the Roux Institute in areas that include machine learning, dynamical systems modeling, biostatistics, human-computer and human-AI interactions, entrepreneurship, and business partnership with not-for-profit research institutions and companies. This research area collaborates closely with Bouvé College of Health Sciences—to further enhance connection to clinical practices and policies—and with Khoury College of Computer Sciences—to further strengthen students’ computational literacy.
### Degree Requirements
Completion of the PhD degree requires students to successfully complete the requirements described below.
#### Curriculum
The curriculum comprises a strong core of fundamental courses that is coupled with flexible choices of restricted and unrestricted technical electives to provide depth in a particular field of study. The detailed course requirements are outlined below.
For students possessing a baccalaureate in a suitable quantitative or technical field before entering the PhD program, the required course distribution is shown in the table below:
Graduate PhD Requirements Requirements |  Credits  
---|---  
Required core courses | 12  
Restricted technical electives | 8  
Unrestricted technical electives | 12  
Advanced seminar (four semesters) |   
Dissertation |   
Minimum semester hours required | 32  
The curriculum for PhD students with advanced standings, i.e., students with an MS degree in relevant engineering areas awarded at a qualified institution, will be selected from the available core and elective courses under the guidance of the program director and the student's primary advisor. Completion of the PhD degree with an advanced standing requires a minimum of 16 semester hours of coursework to be approved by the graduate director and a completed PhD dissertation.
Graduate PhD Requirements Requirements |  Credits  
---|---  
Required core courses | 8  
Advisor-approved coursework | 8  
Advanced seminar (four semesters) |   
Dissertation |   
Minimum semester hours required | 16  
#### Qualifying Exam (Written and Oral)
To qualify to continue in the PhD program, students must pass the bioengineering qualifying examination in their research area. Students will prepare a seven-page written document that will be distributed to the committee before the oral examination. Details of the formal qualification exam procedure and timing are available in the _[Graduate Handbook](https://bioe.northeastern.edu/community/resources-for-current-students/)._ In addition, satisfactory research progress and academic standing are required to pass the exam. The qualifying exam is normally taken in the student’s second year.
#### Qualifying Exam Committee
The qualifying examination committee is composed of three members of the Department of Bioengineering faculty. At least two of three committee members will be from the student’s research area. The student's primary research advisor may not sit on the qualifying exam committee.
#### PhD Dissertation Committee
Students normally form their dissertation committee within two years of joining the PhD program. The dissertation committee is composed of a minimum of three members, two of whom must be core faculty from the Department of Bioengineering. The student's primary advisor will be a member of and chair the dissertation committee. This advisor must be a member of the core bioengineering faculty or a faculty member from another department who has an affiliation with the bioengineering department. Students are required to meet annually with their PhD dissertation committee to ensure satisfactory research progress.
#### Annual Committee Meetings and Dissertation Proposals
PhD students must hold their first committee meetings no later than their third year. The first committee meeting requires the student to write a dissertation proposal in the form of an NIH-style R21 proposal research plan that will be distributed to their dissertation committee at least one week prior to the meeting. Thereafter, students are expected to hold annual progress updates with their committee. At the penultimate committee meeting (which must be held at least four months prior to the dissertation defense), the student will prepare and present a final proposal document to the committee. Successful defense of this proposal will allow the student to progress to the PhD dissertation defense.
#### PhD Dissertation Defense
PhD candidates must satisfactorily complete and defend a dissertation describing original research in bioengineering in an open presentation to the Northeastern bioengineering community, followed by a closed meeting with their dissertation committee in which they are expected to defend their work and answer all relevant questions regarding that work, its significance, and its relationship to ongoing work across the broader research community.
#### Dissertation Course Requirements
After achieving PhD candidacy by passing the qualifying exam, the doctoral candidate, in consultation with their research advisor, must register in two consecutive semesters (may include full summer term) for Dissertation Term 1 (BIOE 9990)Dissertation Term 2 (BIOE 9991)Dissertation Continuation (BIOE 9996)Dissertation Continuation (BIOE 9996)Dissertation Term 1 (BIOE 9990)Dissertation Term 2 (BIOE 9991)
PhD students who have completed the majority of their coursework and not yet reached PhD candidacy should register for Research (BIOE 9986) in a section for which their research or academic advisor is listed as the instructor in the online registration system.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
