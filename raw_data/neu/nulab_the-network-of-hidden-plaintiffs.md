In federal litigation, the parties to the case, their attorneys, and amicus filers are the most visible actors, in addition to the justices. However, hidden from plain view is another group of important actors who are neither litigants, nor attorneys, and cannot be squared as interest groups either. Hidden plaintiffs are the individuals or groups who for personal or professional reasons have an interest in the crafting policy through the courts. To that effect they directly or indirectly sponsor litigation through funding, legal expertise, or access to information, exerting a strong but overlooked influence over the Supreme Court’s docket. To date, there is little in the form of systematic research of these actors. Prof. Abi-Hassan undertakes the first study of these hidden plaintiffs, and examine their motivations, abilities, and successful strategies, and with it their ability to shape public policy. Making use of an extensive database that combines all writ of certiorari petitions (original), Supreme Court cases, and the Amicus Curiae Network, it identifies key individuals behind landmark US litigation. The project connects these actors to the network of amicus organizations, to investigate their role in successfully shaping public policy through Supreme Court litigation.
