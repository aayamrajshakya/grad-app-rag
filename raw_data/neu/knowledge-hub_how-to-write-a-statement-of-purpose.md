Congratulations! You’ve [chosen a graduate program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-find-the-right-graduate-school/), read up on [tips for applying to grad school](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/applying-to-graduate-school-tips/), and even [written a focused grad school resumé](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-write-a-grad-school-resume/). But if you’re like many students, you’ve left the most daunting part of the application process for last—writing a statement of purpose. The good news is that the task doesn’t have to feel so overwhelming, as long as you break the process down into simple, actionable steps. Below, learn how to write a strong, unique statement of purpose that will impress admissions committees and increase your chances of getting into your dream school. 
## What is a statement of purpose?
A statement of purpose (SOP), sometimes referred to as a personal statement, is a critical piece of a graduate school application that tells admissions committees who you are, what your academic and professional interests are, and how you’ll add value to the graduate program you’re applying to. 
Jared Pierce, former associate director of enrollment services at Northeastern University, says a strong statement of purpose can be the deciding factor in a graduate student’s admission. 
“Your statement of purpose is where you tell your story about who you are and why you deserve to be a part of the [university’s] community. It gives the admissions committee the chance to get to know you and understand how you’ll add value to the classroom,” he says.
### How long should a statement of purpose be?
“A statement of purpose should be between 500 and 1,000 words,” Pierce says, noting that it should typically not exceed a single page. He advises that students use a traditional font at a readable size (11 or 12 points) and leave enough white space in the margins to make the statement easy to read. Make sure to double-space the statement if the university has requested it, he adds. 
## How to write a statement of purpose: a step-by-step guide
Now that you understand how to format a statement of purpose, you can begin drafting your own. Getting started can feel daunting, but Pierce suggests making the process more manageable by breaking down the writing process into four easy steps.
### 1. Brainstorm your ideas.
First, he says, try to reframe the task at hand and get excited for the opportunity to write your statement of purpose. 
“Throughout the application process, you’re afforded few opportunities to address the committee directly,” he explains. “Here is your chance to truly speak directly to them. Each student arrives at this process with a unique story, including prior jobs, volunteer experience, or undergraduate studies. Think about what makes you _you_ and start outlining.”
When writing your statement of purpose, Pierce suggests asking yourself these key questions:
  * Why do I want this degree?
  * What are my expectations for this degree? 
  * What courses or program features excite me the most?
  * Where do I want this degree to take me, professionally and personally?
  * How will my unique professional and personal experiences add value to the program?


Jot these responses down to get your initial thoughts on paper. This will act as your starting point for creating an outline and writing your first draft.
### 2. Develop an outline.
Next, you’ll want to take the ideas that you’ve identified during the brainstorming process and plug them into an outline that will guide your writing. 
An effective outline for your statement of purpose might look something like this:
  1. Introduction
     * An attention-grabbing hook
     * A brief introduction of yourself and your background as it relates to your motivation behind applying to graduate school 
  2. Body 
     * Your relevant experience and accomplishments that relate to the field
       * Example 1
       * Example 2
       * Example 3
     * Your professional goals as they relate to the program
     * Why you’re interested in the specific school and what you can bring to the table
  3. Conclusion
     * A brief summary of the information presented in the body that emphasizes your qualifications and compatibility with the school


An outline like the one above will give you a roadmap to follow so that your statement of purpose is well organized and concise. 
### 3. Write the first draft.
Your statement of purpose should communicate who you are and why you are interested in a particular program, but it also needs to be positioned in a way that differentiates you from other applicants. 
Admissions professionals already have your transcripts, resumé, and test scores; the statement of purpose is your chance to tell your story in your own words.
When you begin drafting content, make sure to:
  * Provide insight into what drives you, whether that’s professional advancement, personal growth, or both.
  * Demonstrate your interest in the school by addressing the unique features of the program that interest you most. For Northeastern, he says, maybe it’s experiential learning; you’re excited to tackle real-world projects in your desired industry. Or perhaps it’s learning from faculty who are experts in your field of study.
  * Be yourself. It helps to keep your audience in mind while writing, but don’t forget to let your personality shine through. It’s important to be authentic when writing your statement to show the admissions committee who you are and why your unique perspective will add value to the program.


### 4. Edit and refine your work.
Before you submit your statement of purpose:
  * Make sure you’ve followed all directions thoroughly
  * Proofread carefully
  * Remember that a statement of purpose should be between 500 and 1,000 words.
  * Walk away and come back later with a fresh set of eyes.
  * Ask someone you trust to read your statement


## Making a lasting impression
Your statement of purpose can leave a lasting impression if done well, Pierce says. It provides you with the opportunity to highlight your unique background and skills so that admissions professionals understand why you’re the ideal candidate for the program that you’re applying to. If nothing else, stay focused on what you uniquely bring to the classroom, the program, and the campus community. If you do that, you’ll excel.
