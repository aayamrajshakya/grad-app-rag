The APS Innovation Fund provides funding to advance collaborative projects that align with the [APS Strategic Plan](https://www.aps.org/about/strategicplan/index.cfm) and support the [APS mission](https://www.aps.org/about/mission.cfm) “to advance and diffuse the knowledge of physics for the benefit of humanity, promote physics, and serve the broader physics community.”
The 2024 application cycle focus is the [2025 International Year of Quantum](https://quantum2025.org/) (IYQ). In recognizing the imperative to cultivate, enrich, and disseminate activities that foster a deeper understanding of quantum concepts and offer opportunities to the public, we are calling upon our members to take a leading role.
