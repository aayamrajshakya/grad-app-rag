Jobs in computer science are in high demand. Seventeen of the 50 positions on Glassdoor’s list of the [best jobs](https://www.glassdoor.com/List/Best-Jobs-in-America-LST_KQ0,20.htm) in the United States—which was based on earning potential, job satisfaction, and the number of job openings in 2021—were in the computer science and technology field.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average salary for these roles exceeds $145,000 per year. Even more promising is that [job growth](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm) for computer and information science roles is expected to increase by 23% by 2032—nearly eight times the national average for growth across all jobs. The average unemployment rate for many STEM roles is also well below the national average, according to U.S. News & World Report
## Computer science degrees and specializations
Due to the high demand and required skills for jobs in this field, many employers seek candidates with advanced computer science degrees to fill these [high-paying roles](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/top-paying-computer-science-jobs/). In fact, Burning Glass Labor Insight data shows that nearly four in 10 computer science job listings request candidates that have master’s degrees.
Below we offer a look at some of the most common specializations within this field, the [career options](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/computer-science-career-options/) that best align with these specializations, and the annual earning potential for individuals within these concentrations.
## 11 common computer science specializations
### 1. Artificial intelligence
Description: [Artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.cio.com/article/3235944/hiring-the-most-in-demand-tech-jobs-for-2021.html) refers to a computing system’s ability to solve problems, make predictions, or complete complex tasks. AI applications use emerging technology such as natural language processing, which interprets written and spoken words, and machine learning, which enables applications to make predictions and recommendations.

## Choosing the right computer science specialization
A rewarding and well-paying job in computer science is attainable for individuals with an interest in any of the above computer science concentrations. However, mid-career professionals may be hesitant to transition into the field due to common [misconceptions about computer science](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/common-misconceptions-about-computer-science/), including that it requires exceptional math skills, or that it means sitting in front of a computer screen all day and night.
It is true that some of the skills needed for a career in computer science are technical. The application development company, [BHW Group](https://thebhwgroup.com/), notes that reading code, evaluating frameworks, using debuggers, and practicing source control are [important skills](https://thebhwgroup.com/blog/8-skills-computer-science-majors-need) for anyone directly involved in the process of building software, for example.
However, many computer science jobs require skills beyond writing and evaluating code. According to [O*Net Online](https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/15-1111.00), these roles also require creativity, critical thinking, problem-solving, project or proposal evaluation, and communication with software end-users, management, or leadership staff. Individuals in these positions must also be comfortable working with teams of various sizes, as much of their work is done in groups.
Ultimately, choosing the right computer science specialization comes down to your personal interests and professional goals. Consider some of the if/then scenarios below to see if your specific preferences align well with a particular career path:
  * If you have an eye for visual design and keen attention to detail, then consider a role as a programmer, game designer, computer graphics designer, or UX designer. These roles also require creativity and flexibility for meeting the requirements of internal and external stakeholders.
  * If you have a background in technical training and back-end operations, consider a role as an engineer, system administrator, or network administrator.
  * If you have technical expertise as well as an ability to negotiate diplomatically, consider a role in information security. Another possible role is a DevOps—shorthand for “developer operations”—engineer, a role that helps organizations bridge the gap between speed and stability in the development lifecycle.
  * If you like to analyze data, detect patterns and gain insights that lead to more informed business decisions, consider a career in artificial intelligence, data science, data analysis, or computer theory. Note that these roles also require [presenting the outcome of data analysis](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/blog-how-to-tell-stories-with-data/) to key stakeholders in clear language.


Due to the array of specializations within the computer science industry, it’s important to find a career path that aligns with your abilities, technical background, and long-term goals.
## Computer science at Northeastern
Revised in 2021, the [Master of Science in Computer Science (MSCS) curriculum](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/ms-in-computer-science-curriculum/) at Northeastern is specifically designed to help you identify the computer science area that best matches your career interests, and to continue to develop the technical skills necessary to secure a fulfilling job within that specialization. In addition to the core curriculum, MSCS students take classes from three “breadth areas”—modeled after our PhD program—that enable students to gain a wider range of specialized skills, thus preparing them to work in many roles. Students must take three courses from at least two breadth areas during their studies. 
These breadth areas include: 
  * Systems and Software:
  * Theory and Security: 
  * Artificial Intelligence and Data Science: 


With your focused master’s degree, you’ll be prepared to chart a bold future in computer science. [Master’s in Computer Science program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-boston-5238/) and explore with path is right for you.
