#  M. WhitneyKelting
Associate Professor of Religious Studies 
M. Whitney Kelting is an associate professor of religious studies. She received her B.A from Colby College, and her MA and PhD in South Asian Language and Literature from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Professor Kelting is the author of Singing to the Jinas: Jain Laywomen, Mandal Singing and the Negotiations of Jain Devotion (Oxford University Press, 2001) and Heroic Wives: Rituals, Stories and the Virtues of Jain Wifehood (Oxford University Press, 2009). Her current research is examining the intersection between gender, prestige and modernity in the Jain community with two separate areas of inquiry—motherhood and temple patronage—both of which are leading towards book projects.

### Hinduism, Buddhism, and Beyond: Eastern Religions
#### PHIl 1275
Examines Hinduism, Jainism, Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, and Shinto within South Asia (India) and east Asia (China and Japan). Combines readings in primary source materials (the religious texts of these traditions) with secondary examinations of the historical and doctrinal developments within each tradition and region. This course intends to give students a context in which to examine the ways in which religions develop in interlocking sociocultural and political contexts and to provide a grounding in the lived experiences of these religious traditions.
