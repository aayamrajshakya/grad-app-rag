With three physical campuses plus an online modality, Northeastern University offers a dynamic education and experiences that are unparalleled in other public affairs programs.
Each campus provides unique experiential learning opportunities as well as access to local experts. Even if a student never visits a physical campus, they will benefit from the connections with their classmates, faculty, and alumni in Boston, Arlington, and Oakland. Learners at Northeastern University are part of a single learning community that spans all campuses and modalities.

## The Boston Campus
Northeastern has been a vital part of Boston for more than a century. This long-standing relationship has led to the establishment of deep connections with hundreds of organizations across the region in both the public and private sectors. Boston is also a hub for innovation with a strong tech industry, a growing biotech sector, and cutting-edge research institutions.
Students living in Boston get to immerse themselves in a vibrant, diverse city with a rich history. Through interactions with individuals from a wide range of backgrounds, they will develop a global perspective and a deeper understanding of the different cultures and needs of the communities that their policies will impact and support.
The Boston campus is available to domestic and international students in the Master of Public Administration, Master of Public Policy, and MS in Criminology and Criminal Justice programs.

## The Arlington Campus
Strategically positioned in the heart of Arlington County’s dynamic Rosslyn neighborhood, the Arlington, Virginia campus is a hub for employers, working professionals, and learners, offering innovative educational programs, research initiatives, and services.
The Arlington campus prepares graduates for roles in public service and various job sectors, providing unique access to experiential learning opportunities in national government, international NGOs, and organizations based in the National Capital Region. 
Northeastern has cultivated close partnerships with leaders in IT and emerging tech, cybersecurity, aerospace and defense, government contracting services, media, charitable and philanthropic organizations, and many more.
Students who want to break into the D.C. ecosystem but may not know where to start will find, through Northeastern’s programs, the guidance and networking opportunities they need to open doors. The campus is easily accessible from downtown Washington, D.C., Capitol Hill, the Pentagon, and locations across the U.S. National Capital Region.
The Arlington campus is available to domestic and international students in the Master of Public Policy and the Master of Public Administration.

## The Oakland Campus
As the West Coast hub of Northeastern’s global network, the Oakland, California campus emphasizes local engagement while helping students develop a robust grounding in public administration. Located at the edge of the Oakland hills, this campus is also home to the Mills Institute, which was formed when Mills College merged with Northeastern in 2022. The Institute is proud to continue Mills’ 170-year legacy of advancing gender and racial justice through programs and partnerships that support transformative teaching and learning, research, and career development.
As soon as you step onto the Oakland campus, you become part of a vibrant, inclusive community where every voice matters. In this welcoming space, you can thrive as your authentic self while working toward your professional goals.
This campus provides a distinctive education that’s rooted in the San Francisco Bay Area. Through small class sizes, rigorous analytical training, and roll-up-your-sleeves assignments with local partners, our students quickly build the skills and confidence they need to and stand out in the job market. Whether you’re an international student, a first-generation college graduate, or a busy professional, our collaborative environment offers the guidance and resources that will empower you to shape the future of public affairs.
The Northeastern School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs also offers a wealth of opportunities that connect graduate students with government agencies, our community partner organizations, and over 30,000 Bay Area alumni from Northeastern and Mills College. In addition to fostering a professional network, these events and activities help students develop new practical skills and heighten their sense of social responsibility — all of which are essential in a public service career. 
The Oakland campus is currently available to both domestic and international students in the Master of Public Administration. It will be available to domestic and international students in the Master of Public Policy starting in the Fall 2025 term.

## The Online Modality
Northeastern’s Master of Public Policy, Master of Public Administration, and MS in Criminology and Criminal Justice can be completed entirely online by domestic students or international students from their home countries. The courses offer the same high quality and engaging content of the on-campus courses coupled with the flexibility of asynchronous lectures.
The online modalities are great options for those who want the benefits of a Northeastern education but are not in a position to make the move to Boston, Arlington, or Oakland. 
Online students can also complete their [experiential learning](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/experiential-learning-opportunities/), including co-op and internships, without traveling to campus.

## On Campus, Online — It’s Your Choice
You get to decide, each semester, whether to complete your coursework entirely online or whether you will take classes on campus — or a combination of the two. 
If you’d like help deciding which modality is best for you, or if you have any questions about these options, our enrollment specialists are here to help.
