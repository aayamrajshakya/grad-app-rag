#  Students Studying in The United States 
The F-1 visa is a nonimmigrant, student visa that enables international students to enter the U.S. to study in full-time degree programs. The F-1 visa is an entry document, and must be valid on the date that you are entering the U.S. 
##  Visa Interview Appointments Must Be Scheduled in Country of Residence or Nationality 
###  Effective September 6, 2025, all applicants for F/J nonimmigrant visas must schedule their visa interview appointment at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country of nationality or residence.

##  Applying for an F-1 Visa 
For comprehensive information about the F-1 student visa application process, please visit the [U.S. Department of State website.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/student-visa.html)
Students are encouraged to apply for their F-1 visa as soon as they receive their Northeastern Form I-20. U.S. Embassies or U.S. Consulates are able to issue F-1 entry visas up to 365 days before the program start date listed on your I-20.
All visa interviews must be scheduled in the applicant’s country of residence or nationality. In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for the visa interview. However, each U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures. Students should consult the specific embassy website or call for application instructions.

#### The following documents are typically required for the F-1 visa application:
  * Online Non-immigrant Visa Application Form (DS-160) confirmation page 
    * See below if you do not yet have a local U.S. address
    * For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20. You can find this information under “School Attestation” on your I-20.
    * View more [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on completing the DS-160 here.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/forms/ds-160-online-nonimmigrant-visa-application/ds-160-faqs.html)
  * Visa application fee payment receipt (visit the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate website for specific instructions)
  * Form I-20 issued by OGS at Northeastern University
  * Valid passport (the passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry into the U.S.)
  * Evidence of financial support (proof of sufficient funds for estimated cost of one academic year)
  * Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) I-901 fee payment receipt
  * A copy of your acceptance letter to Northeastern University

All applicants should be prepared to provide additional information, such as transcripts or diplomas from previously attended institutions, or documents which demonstrate that the applicant intends to return home after their studies. Dependents will receive their own I-20 with their own unique SEVIS ID to apply for the F-2 visa. Dependents are not required to pay the SEVIS fee.
No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, final travel plans or the purchase of non-refundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa has been issued, please be sure the F-1 visa stamp in your passport is accurate and that your original I-20 has been returned to you as you will need to have it in hand when entering the U.S.
Note: 
##  Online Presence and Social Media Review in the Visa Application Process 
###  Updated June 23, 2025 
The U.S. Department of State (DoS) has announced expanded vetting of “online presence” for all F and J visa applicants, including students and exchange visitors. As part of this consular process, applicants are required to:
  * Disclose all social media identifiers on the DS-160 visa application
  * Set their social media profiles to “public” for consular review


Media reports based on a cable from the Secretary of State indicate that consular officers will be required to review applicants’ online presence for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States”. Reports also state that that consular officers should flag “advocacy for, aid or support for foreign terrorists, and other threats to U.S. national security” and “support for unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence”.

Please use this guide from NAFSA for your reference: [10 Points to Remember When Applying for a Student Visa](https://www.nafsa.org/professional-resources/browse-by-interest/10-points-remember-when-applying-student-visa).
##  Visa Application Outcomes 
###  Please note that if you do not receive your F-1 visa prior to the start of your program, you may be advised to defer your admission to a future term. 
####  [ Approval ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/f-1-visa-process/#collapse-85681345-1)
Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you.
####  [ Denials ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/f-1-visa-process/#collapse-85681345-2)
214(b) Denial
Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their studies and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT.
The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer’s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial.
If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial.
PP 10043 Denial
On May 29, 2020, a [Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/06/04/2020-12217/suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-students-and-researchers-from-the-peoples-republic) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China’s “military-civil fusion strategy.” This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected.
Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations.
If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance.
Students should review the [Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/visa-denials.html) for more information and guidance about visa denials.
####  [ Administrative Processing ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/f-1-visa-process/#collapse-85681345-3)
The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as “Administrative ProcessinginternalPlease note that this is not a visa denial.
If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or [submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal.](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs?_gl=1*n2cufc*_gcl_au*MTk2OTMxMTcxMy4xNzE4NjI5NjM2) You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance.
What is “Administrative Processing”?
After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including:
  * Social media review
  * Your country of birth or citizenship
  * Academic or employment history, including military experience
  * Travel history
  * Source of funding
  * Past U.S. immigration records
  * Family members’ backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history
  * Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence
  * Geopolitical factors


These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn’t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields.
Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa.
Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process.
If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment.
Next Steps During Administrative Processing
If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process.
Please refer to the [Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/administrative-processing-information.html) for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing.
##  Expedited Visa Appointments 
U.S. Embassies/Consulates overseas may be able to expedite your F-1 visa interview date if your I-20 program start date is within 60 days, and there are no available visa interview slots prior to your start date.
The process to request an expedited F-1 visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the [Embassy or Consulate Visa Section](https://www.usembassy.gov/) where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site. You will need to provide proof of the need for an earlier appointment (such as your I-20 showing a program start date within 60 days).
Please note _: You must first_
##  Entering the U.S. 
When preparing for your arrival to the U.S., you should plan your travel according to the information provided by your college. According to immigration regulations, F-1 student visa holders can enter the U.S. up to 30 days prior to the program report date on the I-20.
Students transferring to Northeastern University in F-1 status from another institution or changing their degree level at Northeastern may stay in the U.S. or travel between programs. And, they may enter the U.S. more than 30 days before the new program start date listed on your I-20.
