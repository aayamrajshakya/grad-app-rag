#  Bachelor of Science in Economics
The Bachelor of Science degree focuses attention on the use of mathematics in economic models in the six core courses and many of the required seven electives. The BS degree allows ample room to take courses such as economic development, game theory, and mathematical economics in addition to more supporting courses in the mathematics and computer science departments.
Students considering future doctoral studies in economics are strongly encouraged to pursue a double major in economics (BS) and mathematics (BS) or to choose our combined economics/mathematics major.
