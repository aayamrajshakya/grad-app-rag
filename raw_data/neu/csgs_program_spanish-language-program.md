#  Language ProgramSpanish
Spanish is the second most spoken language in the world. It is used in more than twenty countries, including the United States. In fact, in terms of the number of speakers, the United States is the second largest Spanish-speaking country in the planet. Being a Spanish speaker is a major professional and cultural asset as it prepares you to be successful in any career path. Yet, in our society, knowing Spanish is not just an asset; it is increasingly a necessity. Not only does proficiency in Spanish prepare you to be a leader in a country where Hispanics are the fastest growing segment of the population and where Spanish-speakers are the vast majority of the population in the hemisphere. Knowing Spanish also makes you a truly global citizen. Successful completion of the minor demonstrates the attainment of intermediate to advanced proficiency in the language, as well as cultural understanding and agility. It also opens before you a fascinating cultural and intellectual world in and beyond the classroom with a myriad of opportunities to travel, live and work abroad.
