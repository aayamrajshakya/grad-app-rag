#  Students Studying in The United States 
The Cap-Gap Extension extends an eligible F-1 student's status to “bridge the gap” between the end of Post-OPT or STEM Extension and the start of H-1B status, thereby allowing the student to remain in the U.S. during the "gap". 
##  What is H-1B Status? 
The H-1B is temporary employment authorization that is used for nonimmigrant individuals in a specialty occupation. In order to become eligible for H-1B status, an employer must sponsor an individual and submit a petition to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
Each year, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has a limit (cap) of 65,000 new H-1B visas for individuals with a bachelor’s degree or higher being sponsored by a cap-subject employer. 20,000 additional H-1Bs are reserved for individuals with a master’s degree or higher earned at a U.S. college or university. Some H-1B visas are not cap-subject, including but not limited to those employed at institutions of higher education, nonprofit research organizations, or government research organizations. H-1B visas are adjudicated through a randomized system for cap-subject employers.

##  What is the Cap-Gap Extension? 
The Cap–Gap Extension is an automatic extension of F-1 status that may be granted to F-1 students who need to “bridge the gap” between the expiration of their OPT/STEM EAD and the start date of their approved H-1B sponsored by a cap-subject employer.
The Cap-Gap Extension allows eligible F-1 students to remain in the U.S. between the expiration of their OPT/STEM Extension and the start of their H-1B.

##  Cap-Gap Extension Eligibility 
###  Please be aware that the responsibility of the Office of Global Services (OGS) regarding H-1B petitions is minimal. 
As an F-1 student, you may be eligible for the Cap-Gap extension if: 
  * You have maintained your F-1 status
  * You are the beneficiary of an H-1B petition that was timely filed by an employer that is cap-subject 
  * The H-1B petition has been filed for a change of status from inside the U.S. 
    * If you have applied for the H-1B via consular processing, you do not qualify for the Cap-Gap Extension.


The Cap-Gap Extension is automatically applied to a student’s SEVIS record. As such OGS is able to provide proof of the extension only if a student has been deemed eligible by USCIS.
If Your H-1B Petition was Filed During Your 60-Day Grace Period:
If your sponsoring employer filed the H-1B petition during your 60-day grace period, your Cap-Gap Extension will allow you to remain in the U.S. until the start date of your H-1B (unless your petition is rejected, denied, or withdrawn). However, your work authorization will not be extended, and you must stop working as of the expiration date on your EAD. 
Please Note:
You can learn more about eligibility for the Cap-Gap Extension here.
##  How can I Request Proof of my Cap-Gap Extension? 
Please fill out this e-form: [Cap Gap I-20 Request](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/cap-gap-i-20-request/). NOTE: we recommend waiting at least 2 weeks
You will need to provide proof of a qualifying “pending” or “approved” H-1B petition. You can provide proof with either of the following documents:
  * USCIS H-1B Approval Notice (I-797A)
  * USCIS H-1B Receipt Notice (I-797C) 
    * Only upload this if you have not yet received your H-1B approval notice (I-797A)
    * NOTE: we can only accept an I-797C if the notice type if “Receipt Notice” confirming the H-1B petition was actually filed. We cannot


If your request meets all requirements outlined above, OGS will issue you an updated I-20 reflecting your Cap-Gap Extension of status, and extension of OPT/STEM work authorization if applicable.
##  Can I Apply for the STEM Extension During the Cap-Gap Extension period? 
F-1 alumni may be eligible to apply for the STEM OPT Extension as long as USCIS receives their application before the expiration of their Post-OPT EAD.However, if your Post-OPT EAD end date is already in the past (even if you have received a Cap-Gap Extension), an application for the STEM OPT Extension is likely to be denied by USCIS. 
If a student chooses to submit an application for the STEM Extension after their Cap-Gap Extension has been applied but before their OPT EAD has expired, they are advised to also submit a letter to USCIS informing them of the date discrepancy that may exist between the actual OPT end date and the Cap Gap Extension end date. The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved, it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date, not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension. All students who request the STEM Extension after Cap-Gap has been applied to their SEVIS record will be emailed a template letter of explanation to submit to USCIS with their STEM Extension application.
If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H-1B, they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H-1B petition prior to its effective date. If this is not done, the H-1B status will begin on its effective date and the student’s eligibility for the STEM OPT extension will be cancelled.
If a student decides to change to H-1B and not proceed with the STEM OPT extension application, the student should send a letter to the USCIS, requesting that the STEM application is withdrawn.
##  Important Travel Considerations 
During the cap gap extension period, F-1 students should only travel internationally if all of the following is true
  * Your H-1B petition **and** request for change of status has been approved by USCIS.
  * You seek readmission before your H-1B employment begins
  * You have all proper documentation including a valid passport, valid, signed Form I-20 with valid travel signature, and a valid F-1 visa.


If you travel abroad **before** USCIS approves your H-1B change of status petition, during your cap gap extension period, USCIS will consider your change of status request abandoned and this could result in H-1B denial
Please see the [USCIS page](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/complete/h-1b-status-and-the-cap-gap-extension) (click the “Traveling on the Cap Gap Extension” dropdown menu) for more information. We also strongly recommend that you coordinate all travel plans during your cap gap extension with your H-1B employer and/or the immigration attorney filing on your behalf.
##  Unemployment During the Cap-Gap Extension Period 
Please note: USCIS has clarified that unemployment during the cap-gap automatic extension counts toward the 90-day (post-completion OPT) or 150-day (for STEM OPT extension) cumulative maximum allowed unemployment.
##  H-1B Reporting 
There are many complexities that an F-1 student may experience when changing their status from F-1 to H-1B.
If your status has already changed or will be changing from F-1 to H-1B, please complete the [H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/h-1b-status-change-reporting/). An OGS Designated School Official (DSO) will review the request and review your F-1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately.
You should fill out this e-form
  * To report that your H-1B petition for change of status was approved (I-797A Approval Notice from USCIS)
  * To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) and you have re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status.
  * To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) but you have NOT re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status yet.
  * To report that your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer.


If you received a Request for Evidence (RFE)[H-1B RFE Response Request e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/h-1b-rfe-response-request/).
If your H-1B petition was denied[H-1B Denial Notification e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/h-1b-denial-notification/). OGS will review the denial notice to determine if any institutional support from OGS or Northeastern is appropriate.
##  Impact of Changing to H-1B from F-1 Status 
If you are approved for H-1B change of status, as of the effective date of the H-1B period, your F-1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes. _Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated_. Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible.
Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your caseIf your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor.
If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition
  * Please review the information provided on the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/extension-of-post-completion-optional-practical-training-opt-and-f-1-status-for-eligible-students).
  * If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you’re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case.
  * If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status. You may have a 60-day grace period during which to find alternative H-1B sponsors or apply for a change of status.
  * Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options.
  * Please review this additional information provided on the [USCIS website](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/options-for-nonimmigrant-workers-following-termination-of-employment#:~:text=Status%20and%20Employer-,Workers%20may%20use%20the%20up%20to%2060%2Dday%20discretionary%20grace,%2C%20or%20H%2D1B1%20classifications.) regarding options following termination of H-1B employment.


If Your Cap-Subject H-1B Petition is Denied by USCIS
  * Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS [website](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/h-1b-specialty-occupations-and-fashion-models/extension-of-post-completion-optional-practical-training-opt-and-f-1-status-for-eligible-students). 
    * If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States.
    * The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States.

##### Frequently Asked Questions
×
####  [ Can OGS provide me with updates on the status of my H-1B petition? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#collapse-1)
OGS is unable to provide updates to students on the status of their H-1B petitions. If questions exist regarding this matter, please refer to your immigration attorney who has completed the H-1B petition on your behalf.
If you see an update to your OPT authorized dates in the SEVP Portal, this may mean there has been an update to your H-1B petition. If you notice your OPT end date has been extended to 04/01, the cap-gap extension may have been applied. Please check with your attorney to discuss next steps.
####  [ Can OGS provide me with a letter concerning employment eligibility or data fixes? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#collapse-2)
OGS is unable to write letters to employers regarding eligibility to work or data fixes. We will be happy to forward the SEVP Policy Guidance regarding these issues. Department of Homeland Security regulations allow you to work if you are eligible for a cap gap extension of OPT, regardless of whether you have a cap gap I-20 or not. Whether your employer will allow you to work is at their discretion.
####  [ What happens if my H-1B is rejected/denied/withdrawn after applying for the cap gap extension? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#collapse-3)
If the student’s H-1B is not selected by the USCIS (rejected), the student will have the standard 60-day grace period* from the date of the rejection notice to depart the U.S., transfer the I-20 to a new program, or apply for a change of status. However, if a denial is based on a discovered status violation, no such grace period exists and the student must leave the U.S. immediately.
If the student’s H-1B petition is selected for processing but then subsequently denied or withdrawn, the student’s OPT ends 10 days after the date of denial/withdrawal. After this, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period*, unless the denial is due to a status violation (please see above).
*Students cannot work during the 60-day grace period.
####  [ If my H-1B processing is delayed and I do not receive my approval by October 1, can I extend my cap gap? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#collapse-4)
There is no extension for the cap gap extension of OPT. It ends on April 1, whether your H-1B is approved by then or is still pending. You will have to stop working on April 1 and wait for the H-1B approval.
####  [ What are my options if my H-1B employment is terminated? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#collapse-5)
