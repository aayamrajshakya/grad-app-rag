# Student Projects
### Mapping Boston’s History
Students learned how to use the Knight Lab StoryMaps tool, built slides individually, and in groups created interactive maps focused on different themes related to Boston’s history. Each of the class’s six discussion sections chose a broad theme to work on, then subgroups chose a focus within that theme, then each student chose specific sites within the group theme.
Here is an example, by the group who focused on sites associated with slavery in Boston in the eighteenth century (links to all of the StoryMaps below):
