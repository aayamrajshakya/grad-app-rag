2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Internet of Things is an interdisciplinary program administered by the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and the Khoury College of Computer Sciences. This program is aimed at preparing highly qualified researchers and a specialized workforce that will lead the development of a globally interconnected continuum of untethered devices and objects interacting with the physical environment, people, and each other. The program will provide students with the necessary knowledge and skills to understand, design, and implement autonomous wireless networked systems of tomorrow operating in uncertain, challenging, extreme environments through a combination of coursework, master project research, and/or industry experience.
