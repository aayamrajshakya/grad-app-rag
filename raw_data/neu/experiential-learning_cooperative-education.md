#  Cooperative Education 
As a science student, there’s no better way to prepare for your future than through Northeastern’s signature co-op program. Spend time exploring career paths available to science majors before you graduate, applying what you’ve learned in class and the lab to real-world challenges. Work alongside experienced mentors who are invested in your growth, and build the confidence that comes from making meaningful contributions in research, education, health, security, and sustainability—wherever your path takes you. 
## About the Co-op Program
For over 100 years, Northeastern has been a world leader in cooperative education, the University’s cornerstone experiential learning program.
By alternating semesters of academic study with periods of full-time work, students are able to transform work across academic and professional contexts. Co-op provides students the opportunity to explore or refine potential career paths, make valuable industry connections, broaden perspectives, and acquire the skills and knowledge needed to succeed —all while learning and growing outside the comfort zone of the classroom.
## How Co-op Works
Eligibility
Undergraduates may participate in co-op after completing three academic semesters. Transfer students are eligible after completing at least one academic semester at Northeastern.
Schedule
Co-op advisors help students plan up to three co-ops while staying on track for graduation in four years.
Preparation
The program includes a mandatory preparation course and a post co-op reflection, which may be completed as part of poster presentation, reflection essay, video, or meeting.
Advantages
Students gain up to 18 months of professional experience and may work in world-renowned health care institutions, neighborhood health clinics, with multinational biotechnology companies, as well as nonprofit research labs.
Compensation
Most co-ops are full-time, paid positions with the co-op employer. Students do not pay tuition while on co-op, although they are still considered full-time students with no change in benefits.
Employers
Northeastern works with more than 3,800 employers across the United States and in 136 countries around the world.

## Employer Testimonials
> > > “I have worked with over 50 Northeastern co-ops over the last 15 years and have been extremely impressed with the consistent levels of motivation and talent in this group. Many have continued on in second co-ops pursuing different projects within the lab, or to senior thesis projects, thereby building on the skills they learn in the first co-op.
>>> Moreover, it has been thrilling to see many students begin to figure out their specific passions for domains of science or medicine through hands-on experience in our lab. Finally, the staff that oversee the co-op program have always been helpful and clearly care about the students and the quality of their experiences.”
>>> Mark Anderman, PhD, Principal Investigator, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard University
> Since 2017, I look forward to welcoming new and enthusiastic Northeastern co-ops at the start of each semester to help in conducting my research at Mass General. Each of the over 10 co-ops I have worked with has been instrumental in moving my clinical trials forward. From recruitment and enrollment to data collection and analysis, each co-op joins us with a strong skillset and more importantly a passion to learn, contribute, and grow.
> As six months is not enough time, I’ve often hired the students part-time at the end of their co-ops to complete ongoing projects and train future hires. It’s truly been a pleasure working with Northeastern University’s co-op program, and I strongly recommend to all researchers.
> Hassan Dashti, PhD, Center for Genomic Medicine, Mass General Research Institute
