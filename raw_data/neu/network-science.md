Our expertise in action
## Tracking the spread of disease
EPISTORM CONSORTIUM / Boston, MA
### Challenge
In the aftermath of COVID, the U.S. needs to prepare for the next outbreak of infectious disease, especially in rural areas.
### Solution
Backed by a $17.5 million grant from the CDC, our world-renowned network science researchers are heading an innovation center to ramp up our resilience. Northeastern leads EPISTORM, a consortium of 10 research institutions, healthcare systems, and private companies using tools like wastewater surveillance, AI, machine learning, and other predictive analytics to help the U.S. make more informed decisions ahead of infectious disease outbreaks.
