**Finding Perspectives Beyond Academia**
In the fast-paced world of pharmaceutical research, bridging the gap between academic theory and industry application can be a challenge for many PhD students. For Shalom Fadullon, a third-year Chemical Engineering PhD student, the LEADERs program offered a perfect opportunity to make that connection while developing crucial professional skills that extend beyond the laboratory.
“I was really interested to see how leadership worked in more of that corporate structure and also give myself an additional experience outside of the academia bubble,” explains Fadullon when asked about her initial interest in the LEADERs program, a
**New Career Paths Open Up**
Fadullon’s placement took her to Merck, one of the largest multinational pharmaceutical companies that delivers innovative health solutions in biologic cancer therapies, vaccines, and animal health products, among others. At Merck’s Cambridge location, Fadullon joined the early discovery team’s specialized functional genomics group, where she worked on developing new technologies that could be leveraged to identify novel targets for future pharmaceutical development. Genomics, a subfield of molecular biology, focuses on structures, functions, evolution, mapping, and editing of genomes, which are an organism’s complete set of DNA – including all its genes. This field is different from _g_ _enetics_ , which focuses on individual genes’ roles in inherited traits, as _genomics_ studies the influence that genes have on the organism as a collective and through interrelations.
What surprised Fadullon the most as a member of the genomics group was the dynamic nature of the work environment. “I kind of assumed every single day would be mapped out and planned, the same thing every single day,” she admits. “Instead, it was really exciting to be there and see the project develop as you go, so you have something new that you’re dealing with every single day.” This experience taught her the importance of flexibility, speaking up, and volunteering new ideas, skills that complement the structured research approach typically emphasized in academic settings. The placement at Merck revealed a stark contrast to the often-isolated nature of some PhD research. While doctoral work in her field frequently involves independent analysis and processing with limited team collaboration, Fadullon was impressed by how a large pharmaceutical company operates as a cohesive unit.
“Being at Merck, you can see how the company operates as this big unit and how all those different groups collaborate,” she notes. “What was really valuable was seeing how I could interact with those other groups, which you may not necessarily get that same experience in the PhD setting.” This exposure to cross-functional teamwork opened her eyes to career possibilities beyond the lab bench. Though she entered the program with an interest in pharmaceutical lab work, the experience introduced her to project management roles and how managers interface with scientists, which were career paths she hadn’t previously considered.
Beyond the industry placement, Fadullon found significant value in the program’s introductory course, “Leading Self and Others.” The collaborative group activities not only taught her important leadership concepts but also helped her build lasting professional relationships. “I’m still friends with some of the people that I met in the class,” she shares. She also continues to participate in the LEADERs program’s monthly workshops, which provide ongoing professional development opportunities covering everything from resume writing to networking strategies. These hour-long gatherings also help to foster and sustain a cross-disciplinary community among current and former LEADERs students. 
**Translating Industry Experience to Academic Research**
Working on the early stages of the pharmaceutical development pipeline at Merck complemented Fadullon’s PhD research perfectly. In her academic research, she studies intestinal organoids, which are miniature, lab-grown versions of the human intestine that mimic the structure and function of a real organ. These tiny 3D tissue cultures allow researchers to study how drugs interact with the gut and its microbiome, or the trillions of bacteria that live in our intestines, without invasive procedures.
While her academic work focuses on the later stages of drug development, specifically how medications can be effectively delivered through the digestive system, her Merck experience showed her the very beginning of the pharmaceutical pipeline. At Merck, she worked on the critical first step, called ‘target identification,’ where scientists determine which proteins or genes in the body should be targeted by a potential new medication. “Seeing both ends of the process gave me a broader perspective on how the pharmaceutical pipeline really works,” she explains. 
The typical pharmaceutical development process spans many years: from initial target discovery, through laboratory testing, animal studies, and multiple phases of human clinical trials, before finally reaching regulatory approval and manufacturing. Fadullon’s experience gave her insight into how these pieces fit together in the complex puzzle of bringing new medications to patients. The experience also transformed her approach to her doctoral research. She now manages her PhD project from a project management point of view, which includes taking a more active approach in meeting with advisors and making sure she is hitting milestones and deliverables.
For PhD students considering the LEADERs program, Fadullon’s advice is straightforward: “Just do it. Take the first class, just sign up.” She emphasizes that even students uncertain about their post-graduation plans will benefit from the program’s perspective-broadening approach and valuable tools for career exploration. Fadullon also praises the program directors for effectively coordinating between the university and partner organizations, and for being responsive to students’ questions about funding and other practical concerns.
As she continues her PhD journey with enhanced leadership skills and broader industry insights, Fadullon represents the kind of well-rounded scientific talent that both academia and industry increasingly seek. They are researchers who can not only make discoveries at the bench but also communicate effectively, collaborate across disciplines, and lead teams toward innovative solutions.
_Upon completion of the “Leading Self and Others” course, LEADERs program staff and partner companies select fellows who align with specific industry needs. PhDs are supported through the fellowship application process and placed in a specialized role to solve a problem in industry. They go on to earn a LEADERs’ Experiential PhD leadership certificate, with guidance from an industry mentor and faculty advisor. The program is run by the PhD Network, which helps prepare students to enter the workforce as impactful researchers._
