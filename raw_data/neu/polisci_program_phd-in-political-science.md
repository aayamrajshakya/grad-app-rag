#  PhDPolitical Science
### Program Overview
The Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Political Science program serves students interested in academic positions as well as research and policy careers. The department and its [faculty](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/polisci/people/?live_wp_people_search%5BrefinementList%5D%5Bfaculty_types%5D%5B0%5D=Full-Time%20Faculty) are committed to providing doctoral students with an excellent educational experience through coursework, comprehensive examinations, and the dissertation. 
The curriculum introduces students to all four fields and also develops their research skills through a series of methodology courses. Students may develop a traditional, academic focus in one of the fields, or they may combine it with public policy to highlight a policy orientation.
### The PhD in Political Science covers four major fields in the discipline:
  * American Government and Politics
  * Comparative Politics
  * International Relations
  * Public Policy


All PhD students are fully funded for 5 years via a Tuition Assistantship which includes stipend, full tuition, and student health insurance. Answers to frequently asked questions can be found [here](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/polisci/prospective-graduate-student-faq/) from the department and [here](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/cssh-graduate-office-admissions-faqs/) from the College of Social Sciences and Humanities.

Prof. Sullivan and PhD student Zeynep Balcioglu, a Turkish native, organized a workshop in Istanbul, March 2016, to develop policy recommendations on the Syrian Refugee crisis and the impact on Turkey. Sullivan is Founding Director of BCARS, the Boston Consortium for Arab Region Studies, supported by the Carnegie Corporation of New York.  I found I have a fervent desire to figure out how things work. Northeastern and Political Science offer a range of ways to think about political problems in a real world context that goes well beyond theory. – Gordon Parris
