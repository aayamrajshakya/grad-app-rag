Northeastern University has implemented a new policy regarding late fees.
If the balance on a student’s account remains unpaid, 30 days after the initial bill due date the University will impose a late fee of $150 on the student’s account.
If the student’s account balance remains unpaid after the initial late fee is assessed, the University will impose an additional 1% late charge once a month, until the balance is paid.
If delinquency continues to a subsequent term, the late fee assessment cycle will start again. There will be an initial late fee, in amount of $150, then an additional 1% late charge once a month until the balance is paid.
If a student or payer wishes to dispute a late fee assessment, they may review and submit the [Late Fee Removal Request form](https://service.northeastern.edu/sfs?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=af129a76dba03c10fab7440805961938&sysparm_category=d5e02da3db2f9010e783f3671d96195f).

Massachusetts institutions of higher learning are required by Commonwealth Law to enroll all qualified students in a health insurance plan that meets or exceeds state minimum requirements. NUSHP is the university’s student health plan administered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts. Students with adequate health insurance may have the option to waive NUSHP.
For additional information about NUSHP, including current costs and instructions on how to complete a waiver, visit the [NUSHP website](https://studenthealthplan.northeastern.edu/) or email [[email protected]](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection).

If a check payment is returned, Student Financial Services will assess a $25 returned check fee.
If two or more returned check payments occur, returned check fees will be assessed, a financial hold may be placed on the student’s account, and an email will be sent to the student’s Husky email account. The email will contain a notification of the returned check fee assessment, the reason for the returned payment, and possible future actions.
These future actions may include the following:
  * The student may lose their ability to make a payment by e-check for up to one year.
  * If the student’s account balance continues to be unpaid, Student Financial Services may assign the balance to one of Northeastern University’s [collections partners](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/collections-partners/).
