## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Nanomedicine is a part-time program designed to introduce scientists, engineers, and physicians to interdisciplinary problem solving in nanomedicine. This experiential learning program is ideal for individuals seeking careers in biotechnology, pharmaceutical, biomedical, or clinical fields. Students study both fundamental and applied aspects of nanomedicine and then apply this knowledge to designing strategies for nanomedicine innovation, translation, and commercialization. The graduate certificate consists of 8 semester hours of NNMD coursework and one elective, totaling 12 semester hours.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
