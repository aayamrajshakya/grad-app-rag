# Network Science at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Building knowledge of the network and systems that connect our world
Research in Network Science at Khoury College uses an interdisciplinary approach that harnesses the tools of computation to study networks that occur in any context: biological and social systems, information networks, technological networks, including the Internet itself, and countless others. 
Viewing networks through a computer science research lens brings the capability to analyze and model networks, for instance using a model of a public health or traffic system to test scenarios and improve practices.
[Meet our faculty](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/research_areas/network-science/#faculty-members)
## Leading-edge methods for analyzing complex networks
Network science research has significant impact across fields. It is key to building understanding of epidemics and guiding public health responses. Online social networks are a dominant communication mode for billions, and network science is at the heart of making these systems work, as well as addressing issues such as misinformation. Network science provides means for visualizing environmental and ecological systems, providing ways to understand human impact on climate, and to create, and test, potential strategies. 
## Sample research areas
  * Network dynamics and evolution
  * Network resilience and evolution
  * Network visualization and modeling
  * Inference and prediction
  * Machine learning on graphs
  * Network science in real-world domains
  * Data mining and machine learning for complex networks


## Domains of interest
  * Analysis of technology’s impact on social networks
  * Mathematical and data-driven computational models of critical infrastructure, biological data, and information systems
  * Analysis and modeling of information and contagion spreading processes
  * Mining and exploring heterogeneous information networks
  * Social network processes in collaborative decision making and team collaboration
  * Control theory for complex networks
  * Political and social influence in networks


## Meet researcher Alan Mislove
Mislove discusses the impact of large-scale platforms and how algorithmic auditing can help broaden understanding.
## Current project highlights
By using network science, Khoury College faculty are discovering shared and contrasting characteristics of asthma and COPD at the molecular level, including shared pathways and genes. This research may lead to better treatments for these common respiratory diseases.
The Network Science Institute at Northeastern has studied how deplatforming of those posting misinformation in response to January 6, 2021, provides insights into the way social media platform policies affect public discourse.
Khoury College faculty are studying the “rabbit hole” effect of YouTube and extremist content. Even after the service’s recommendation algorithm was changed to reduce access to extremist content, researchers uncovered that users still found it via subscriptions or external referrals. Even videos that weren’t directly available on YouTube could be embedded on extremist websites, and recommendation algorithms did little to affect these networks. This has potential impact for policy and practice addressing such content.
