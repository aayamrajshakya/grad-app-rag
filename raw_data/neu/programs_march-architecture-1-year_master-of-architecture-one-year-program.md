Program overview 
##  Contemporary architecture study 
This program is open to candidates with either a BS in Architecture from Northeastern University or a professional Bachelor of Architecture degree from an accredited North American program with at least one year of IDP-approved professional experience.
The physical and cultural context of Boston serves as a laboratory for the program’s design studios, and the program is design-focused, but with a different approach than many schools. We find opportunities for innovation within the real estate and construction industries and current policy debates-rather than outside of them. This is how we intend to move architects to the center of the discussion about the future of our cities.
This program gives eligible candidates the opportunity to get a NAAB-accredited Master of Architecture degree in one year.
