## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Theorizing Gender & Sexuality](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/wmns/)
#### WMNS 6100
This interdisciplinary course offers debates around sex, gender, sexuality, and the body that push beyond binary models reliant on a simple “nature/culture” distinction. Focuses on dynamic and variable aspects of sexuality, sex, and gender within and across cultures, representational forms, and historical periods, analyzing the circumstances in which they undergo significant challenge or transformation. Uses particular paradigmatic “case studies” to push hard at the boundaries of sex and gender as they circulate in specific discourses of feminism, queer theory, and poststructuralism; ethnic studies; critical race theory; and cultural studies. 


### [Feminist Resistance ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/wmns/)
#### WMNS/HIST/SOCL 5240
Engages students in the study of a variety of forms of feminist resistance in recent history, emphasizing the United States in the context of cross-cultural examples. Examines key feminist texts and manifestos and studies feminist activism in coalition with other social movements. Students identify and analyze unique features of gender-based activism in itself and in its intersections with other social movements, including movements and activism focused on race, class, sexuality, and physical ability.
