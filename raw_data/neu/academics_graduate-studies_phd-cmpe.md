## Innovative Curriculum
Northeastern offers a PhD in Computer Engineering that is research-based with minimal and flexible course requirements which can be pursued as full-time or part-time. Applicants can enter the PhD program with either a BS or an MS degree in computer engineering or a closely related field. Students entering the program with a BS degree need to also complete MS requirements, which includes selecting a concentration.
As a computer engineering student at Northeastern, you will study computer architecture, software engineering, computer-aided design (VLSI), microprocessor-based design, and applied algorithms. In addition to a broad background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, this curriculum gives you solid foundation in both hardware and software design. RISC microprocessors, object-oriented Java, and cellular networks are just three of the technologies you will encounter in the program.
The internet has revolutionized all aspects of our lives, from the way we communicate to the way we do business. Wireless communication, online commerce, medicine, and multimedia are examples of new applications that have transformed our world. Computer engineers developed the fundamental technologies that made the web possible, including high-performance microprocessors, gigabit networks, and object-oriented computer languages. Students with a strong background in computer engineering are aggressively recruited by cutting-edge computer companies nationwide.

Toggle Accordion  Graduate Program Deadlines 
  * Qualifying exam: Students who already hold an MS degree and matriculate in the fall semester must take the qualifying exam in the spring semester of their first year. Students matriculating in spring semester, or students who hold a BS degree and matriculate in the fall semester, can postpone the exam to the second spring semester. Those who fail the exam the first time, have one more chance to take the exam. These students must take the exam the next spring after their first attempt.
  * Research advisor: Students should have a research advisor one year after their matriculation.
  * Thesis committee: The Dissertation Committee must be formed not later than six months after passing the qualifying exam.
  * Comprehensive exam: The deadline for comprehensive exam is two years after passing the qualifying exam.
  * Dissertation defense: The dissertation defense should be scheduled at least one year after taking the comprehensive exam.

## Experiential Learning
With a large number of high-tech firms in and around Boston, both start-ups and large multinational corporations, many PhD students do an internship during their program while remaining right here in Boston. Often their advisor is instrumental in identifying the internship position, with a funding sponsor or research collaborator, be they in Boston or elsewhere in the United States. Internships can be informally arranged for several months at any time during the calendar year.
PhD students can also take advantage of the more formally arranged co-op program which entails up to 8 months of work experience preceded by several professional development courses to prepare students. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a co-op program for graduate students. Through this program, students gain professional experience, employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum. Northeastern has more than 3,000 co-op employer partners. Another option for PhD students is the university’s [Experiential PhD](https://phd.northeastern.edu/network/experientialphd/) program.
