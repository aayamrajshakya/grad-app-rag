#  Master of ScienceExtended Realities
## Stand at the Cutting-Edge of XR
The MS in Extended Realities (XR+) program prepares students to master the interdisciplinary skills, theoretical foundations, technologies, and processes essential for creating impactful XR experiences. Students gain a deep understanding of XR theory, history, and state-of-the-art hardware and software for augmented, virtual, and mixed reality. Through critical analysis and hands-on projects, students learn to critique XR experiences, develop domain-specific vocabulary, craft engaging narrative content, and rapidly prototype innovative XR solutions.
Recognizing the immense growth of XR applications in fields such as medicine, business, entertainment, architecture, and journalism, the university leverages over a decade of strategic investment and expertise in the field. The program’s flexible structure allows students to tailor their educational path, combining a robust core curriculum with a chosen concentration. This experiential, project-based approach equips graduates with the practical knowledge, interdisciplinary insight, and specialized expertise needed to excel in the rapidly expanding XR industry.
