#  YanetCanavan
Principal Lecturer in Spanish 
Yanet Monica Canavan hails from Lima, Peru and has had a great deal of experience teaching in her native country. Her experience there includes teaching at public and private high schools, as well as teaching Spanish language and literature for the Peruvian Air Force. She also taught Spanish literature to undergraduate and graduate students at the private university, Inca Garcilazo de La Vega, in Lima, and she taught English for the Peruvian British Cultural Association, BRITANICO. She also worked as the academic director of a language center in Boston, where her duties were to design curricula and to hire and train teachers to teach Spanish using a communicative method. She designed and taught medical Spanish courses at different levels for the staff of Massachusetts General Hospital, and she developed and taught Spanish courses for lawyers at MCLE (Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education). At Harvard University, she taught Spanish to graduate students. She taught Spanish to professionals at different companies, including International Data Group: SHIRE, a biopharmaceutical company; Capital Paternon; and State Street. She also gave private Spanish instruction to Boston Red Sox Manager, Terry Francona.
Ms. Canavan has a passion for teaching. She makes sure that students have fun while learning the Spanish language and the Latino culture. She knows that students learn in different ways: some are visual learners, and some are auditory learners, but most learn best through a combination of both styles. She discovers her students’ needs and uses the teaching methods that best fits their learning styles.
