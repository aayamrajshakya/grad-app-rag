#  AaronBlock
Teaching Professor in English 
Aaron Block’s academic interests include evaluation and labor practices in higher education. Outside of the classroom (and, let’s be honest, from time to time inside the classroom) he enjoys reading and talking about comic books, collecting jazz records, and making a really fantastic sandwich. Originally from Texas, he understands if you believe Austin is the coolest thing about his home state, but will strenuously recommend you spend time in San Antonio, instead.
