#  Digital IntegrationTeaching Initiative
A presentation on [Our Marathon](https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/) for an Advanced Writing in the Disciplines course
The [NULab](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/) and the [Digital Integration Teaching Initiative](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/) have developed this toolkit to serve as a collection of resources for tools that can be used to share, preserve, and celebrate local stories and heritage materials. The tools below all are free or have free versions, and none of them require Northeastern University credentials. The slide sets, handouts, and examples are all shared under a [Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) license, which means that you are free to adapt and re-use them, but not to sell or republish them under a different license. We are hoping that these resources will be useful in a few contexts:
  * For self-directed individual learning
  * For community organizations considering their options for creating digital publications or starting digital projects
  * For classes that involve community collaborations 


Most of this guide is organized by specific tools, but we have also collected some general resources—if you are just getting started with thinking about community-based digital projects, we’d encourage you to begin by reviewing the materials in this section. Please note that this toolkit focuses on free and lightweight digital tools for sharing heritage materials and is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of options for building digital projects. See the NULab’s [resources page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/) for a fuller set of tutorials, datasets, and guides. 
Please send us any [feedback](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/contact/) you might have on ways this toolkit could be more useful! 
## General resources:
The resources in this section are relevant for many different kinds of digital publications and tools: 
  * [Data privacy handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WqcKhge0xII-FGEDmRf-DD6HDxDn5XvT0b8F6-munQ8/edit): this handout outlines some important considerations for using free online tools that involve signing up for accounts. 
  * [Accessibility handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XAVk4nWyMzH2dEcxUuCb60kAogkYmLZ3nD0WiE0wFdo/edit): this handout shares some good starting points for ensuring that digital publications are accessible to readers with all kinds of abilities. 
  * [Copyright and fair use handout](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oU4Ma9yelOsQ6f8OM2NiQkDG5T5pAKzyS_B8PsThqIQ/edit): this handout provides instruction for re-publishing digital media objects, shares resources for finding content you can use, and covers best practices for using content created by others. 
  * [Data ethics handout](https://bit.ly/handout-data-ethics): this handout shares considerations and best practices for creating, manipulating, and performing research with data, especially data involving people.

  * [Archives and Special Collections](https://library.northeastern.edu/archives/archives-special-collections/) in the Northeastern University Library collaborates with [community members on many projects](https://library.northeastern.edu/archives/archives-special-collections/work-with-us/community-projects-collaborations/) and they also offer [workshops and opportunities to teach with the Archives collections](https://library.northeastern.edu/archives/archives-special-collections/work-with-us/teaching-with-archives/). They also publish useful resources such as a [Zotero library](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2186116/ethical_engagement), and the white paper “[Principles of Anti-Oppressive Community Engagement for University Educators and Researchers](https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:5x21tg54q)” by Rebecca Riccio, Giordana Mecagni, and Becca Berkey. 
  * The [Digital Transgender Archive](https://www.digitaltransgenderarchive.net/) has published a [Harm Reduction Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15usOPOUi4Edq0gz2O47xbQBgvYJJlpX3sj6_LDOaQuM/edit) that shares many useful principles and questions that projects planning to publish information about individual persons might consider.


## StoryMap
[StoryMap](https://storymap.knightlab.com/) is a user-friendly platform published by Knight Lab for creating “story maps,” or maps that combine a narrative with geographic locations. StoryMap can be used for many purposes, including research projects, community narratives, and even personal planning (map a road trip or your favorite restaurants!). It can contain audio, video, and other forms of embedded media, making the final StoryMap interactive and easy-to-understand for different types of readers.

## Google My Maps:
[Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/) is a user-friendly tool for adding locations and routes to Google Maps. With this tool, you can publish maps showing different points, neighborhoods, and paths—giving these descriptions and adding images, videos, or other media. Google My Maps is a great resource for creating maps that people can use to navigate physical locations while learning about their histories and communities.
