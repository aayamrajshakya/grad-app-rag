#  LindaBlum
Professor of Sociology 
Linda Blum is a qualitative sociologist whose interests include: contradictions in contemporary gender relations; disability, health, and the body; and families, work, inequality and intersectionality. She has long studied how gender ideologies in the United States measure women against each other, as respectable or disreputable, fit or unfit, in ways that reinforce class and race inequality and individualize responsibility for larger structural inequality. In addition to articles and chapters, she is the author of Between Feminism and Labor: The Significance of the Comparable Worth Movement (1991, University of California Press); At the Breast: Ideologies of Breastfeeding and Motherhood in the Contemporary United States (1999, Beacon); and Raising Generation Rx: Mothering Kids with Invisible Disabilities in an Age of Inequality (2015, NYU Press).
