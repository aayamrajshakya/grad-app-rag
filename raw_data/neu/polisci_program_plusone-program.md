#  PlusOne Program
The PlusOne
If you are a motivated and academically outstanding student, you can begin earning a [Master of Arts [MA] in Political Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/polisci/program/master-of-arts-in-political-science/) or a [Master of Science [MS] in Resilience Studies](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/polisci/program/master-of-science-in-resilience-studies/) during your junior year while completing your Bachelors degree. This is achieved by allowing you to “double count” up to 16 graduate credits toward both your graduate and undergraduate degree requirements. Please refer to the requirements outlined in the [course catalog](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/social-sciences-humanities/political-science/#programstext) for courses that will count towards the MA or MS degrees.
## Program Benefits: 
  * Professionals who enter the workforce with graduate level experience are often more competitive.
  * The PlusOne option makes financial sense. Up to 16 graduate credits will count toward the completion of your undergraduate degree and your graduate degree at no additional cost. This can equal up to half the required credits for your graduate degree.
  * The PlusOne program can accelerate your receipt of a graduate degree. In most cases a PlusOne degree student can obtain both their undergraduate and graduate diplomas with only one additional year of study.
