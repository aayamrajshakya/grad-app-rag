#  PhD inPublic Policy
## Interdisciplinary. Experiential. Scholarly focused.
Northeastern University’s PhD in Public Policy is a scholarly-focused degree and training program for individuals interested in conducting research in academia or other high-level professional settings, such as think tanks, nonprofit organizations, industry, and government. It equips students with the theory and research skills to address societal issues of pressing concern at national and international levels, such as sustainability and resilience, urban planning and policy, and health policy. 
Students take core courses in policy theory, quantitative and qualitative methods, and research design, and specialize in one of three concentrations: Sustainability and Resilience, Urban and Regional Policy, and Health Care Policy and Management. Students develop insight, experience, and synergies while working with faculty on key research projects or working at any of the school’s [research centers](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/policyschool/research/centers-labs/). The school provides a high level of support, allowing students to excel in their studies and research.
