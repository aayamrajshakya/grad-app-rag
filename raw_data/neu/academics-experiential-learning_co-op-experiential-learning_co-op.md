#  Cooperative Education 
##  An innovative approach to education that integrates professional industry experience into the academic curriculum 
Experiential learning, anchored by our world-renowned cooperative education program, is the heart of a Northeastern education. Starting in 1909, the College of Engineering was the first school at Northeastern to offer the co-op program. Today the university is [ranked No. 1 in internships/co-ops](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/internship-programs) by U.S. News and World Report.
Co-op gives BS, MS, and PhD students an opportunity to work within their profession for four, six, or eight-month periods as part of their academic curriculum, giving them real-world experience and a competitive edge after graduation. Co-op positions are also available locally and [globally](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/global-experiences/) and for industry and research positions.
Co-op is also of high value to employers, providing them access to talented and innovative students to meet their workforce needs and business objectives.

#### Bioengineering at the Speed of Covid
Ella Strzegowski (Bioengineering E’23) embarked on a co-op at Moderna in the fall of 2021, just as the company was applying for its biologics license and COVID-19’s Omicron variant was tearing through the population. Her experience placed her at the epicenter of covid-related research even as the virus—and the world’s response to it—changed by the day.
