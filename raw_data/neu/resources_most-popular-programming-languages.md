There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. According to an analysis of job postings data, programming jobs grew by 23.5% in 2022. What’s more, the median annual pay for a software programmer was about $120,200, nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers, which was $45,000.
Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be daunting, especially for professionals with no prior programming experience.

The [Align Master of Science in Computer Science](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-computer-science-align-boston-5234/) program at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another field of study.
“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer science programs at [Northeastern University in Seattle](https://www.northeastern.edu/seattle/). “We focus on math, programming, and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”
Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages based on the number of job postings requiring language skill, the average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.
## Top 10 most in-demand programming languages
The 10 most in-demand programming languages in 2023 are:
  1. Structured Language Query (SQL)
  2. Python
  3. Java
  4. JavaScript
  5. C#
  6. C++
  7. R
  8. C
  9. Go
  10. Perl


### 1. SQL
Number of jobs: 1,248,972
Average annual salary: $110,000
Benefits:[ Structured Language Query (SQL)](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/sql-data-analyst/) is considered a standard across every industry and has existed for more than 45 years. One of its primary benefits is its ease of use. While many other languages require you to memorize multiple sequential steps to complete tasks, SQL uses declarative statements, pulling data with English words instead of strings of numbers. This means you don’t need to memorize how to obtain the data because SQL does all the work. It’s also an excellent starting point for beginners, since it’s relatively simple and widely used.  

Drawbacks: One of the primary drawbacks is that many users find it difficult to navigate SQL’s interface.
Common uses: [many organizations’ data practices](https://www.thedrum.com/industryinsights/2017/09/11/sql-training-courses-why-every-professional).
### 2. Python
Number of jobs: 1,049,041
Average annual salary: $120,700
Benefits: [simple syntax](https://www.codingdojo.com/blog/top-programming-languages), a [large library of standards and toolkits](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e), and integration with other popular programming languages such as C and C++. In fact, it’s the first language that students learn in the Align program. “You can cover a lot of computer science concepts quickly, and it’s relatively easy to build on,” Gorton says. It is a popular programming language, especially among startups, and therefore Python skills are in high demand.
Drawbacks: 
Common uses:[ Python is used in a wide variety of applications](https://www.dice.com/career-advice/7-programming-languages-learn-2020), including artificial intelligence, financial services, and data science. [Social media sites](https://hackr.io/blog/best-programming-languages-to-learn) such as Instagram and Pinterest are also built on Python.  

### 3. Java
Number of jobs: 784,622
Increase in job postings: 
Average annual salary: $124,800
Benefits: 
Drawbacks: **

Common uses: Along with business applications, Java is used extensively in the Android mobile operating system.
### 4. Javascript
Number of jobs: 671,436
Average annual salary: $117,100
Benefits: 
Drawbacks: Internet browsers can disable JavaScript code from running, as JavaScript is used to code pop-up ads that in some cases can contain malicious content. 
Common uses: JavaScript is used extensively in website and mobile application development. Node.js allows for the development of browser-based applications, which do not require users to download an application. 
### 5. C#
Number of jobs: 353,323
Average annual salary: $115,100
Benefits: Microsoft developed C# as a faster and more secure variant of C. It is fully integrated with Microsoft’s .NET software framework, which supports the development of applications for Windows, browser plug-ins, and mobile devices. C# offers shared codebases, a large code library, and a variety of data types.
Drawbacks: C# can have a steep learning curve, especially for resolving errors. It is less flexible than languages such as C++. 
Common uses: 
### 6. C++
Number of jobs: 318,199
Average annual salary: $120,200
Benefits: C++ is an extension of C that works well for programming the systems that run applications, as opposed to the applications themselves. C++ also works well for multi-device and multi-platform systems. Over time, programmers have written a large set of libraries and compilers for C++. Being able to use these utilities effectively is just as important to understanding a programming language as writing code, Gorton says.
Drawbacks: **  
**
Common uses: 
### 7. R
Number of jobs: 312,838
Average annual salary: $105,900
Benefits:[ R](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/r-vs-excel/) is heavily used in statistical analytics and machine learning applications. The language is extensible and runs on many operating systems. Many large companies have adopted R in order to analyze their massive data sets, so programmers who know R are in great demand.

Number of jobs: 141,559
Average annual salary: $140,200 
Benefits: Also referred to as Golang, Go was developed by Google to be an efficient, readable, and secure language for system-level programming. It works well for distributed systems, in which systems are located on different networks and need to communicate by sending messages to each other. While it is a relatively new language, Go has a large standards library and extensive documentation.
Drawbacks: Go has not gained widespread use outside of Silicon Valley. Go does not include a library for graphical user interfaces, which are the most common ways that end-users interact with any device that has a screen. 
Common uses: Go is used primarily for applications that need to process a lot of data. In addition to Google, companies using Go for certain applications include Netflix, Twitch, and Uber. 
### 10. Perl
Number of jobs: 116,172
Average annual salary: $114,000
Benefits: 
Drawbacks: 
Common uses: Perl is most commonly associated with Unix/Linux operating systems, but can also be effective on Windows. It’s used for tasks such as automating system administration and often serves as the glue between several different computer systems or interfaces. 
## 8 other programming languages to consider
The following programming languages aren’t quite as popular as the 10 listed above, but they are also worth considering if you’re looking to expand your programming options.
  * Dart is optimal for programming applications that need to run on multiple platforms, such as Windows and iOS. 
  * Kotlin is used to develop applications for the Android OS. 
  * MATLAB is a proprietary language developed by MathWorks and used for scientific research and numerical computing. 
  * Swift
  * Ruby is losing traction as compared to other languages, but the Ruby on Rails framework was influential to other, later web application frameworks for Python, PHP, and JavaScript.
  * Rust emphasizes high performance and security and is useful for applications where many things are happening concurrently.
  * Scala, named as a play on _scalable language_ , is compatible with Java and is useful for cloud-based applications. 
  * PHP


## Which programming language should you learn?
Some programmers are able to build a career out of being an expert in one language, but many programmers learn new languages frequently, Gorton says, with some becoming fluent in three or four. 
The type of software you want to develop is one consideration for which programming languages to learn. While there are no concrete rules for what language is used to write what software, here are a few guidelines: 
  * Web-based startups are more likely to be programming in Python and JavaScript.
  * Larger companies tend to develop their internal software applications using C# or Java and their web applications using PHP.
  * Programs for data analytics typically use the R and MATLAB programming languages.
  * Embedded devices, such as those in the automotive and healthcare industries, run software written in C, C++, or Rust.
  * Applications that run on the cloud are increasingly written in Go or Scala. 
  * Mobile applications are increasingly written in Swift or Kotlin.
