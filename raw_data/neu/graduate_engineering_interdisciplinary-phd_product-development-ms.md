2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Product development is in demand across many technology industries and is widely thought to be the engine of innovation. The Sherman Center for Entrepreneurial Engineering Education is uniquely positioned to offer students a combination of product process and technical skills. The mission of the center is to enable interdisciplinary student entrepreneurship in the broadest sense by providing education about tools, concepts, and resources to foster creativity and the ability to develop commercially viable ideas.
Products ranging from smart devices to the Internet of Things to software as a service all require people with product development skills. These positions guide product innovation and lead in crafting products for users. A look at any careers page for any technology firm currently hiring shows many positions open for individuals that have a mix of technical and product development knowledge.
The Master of Science in Product Development program contains a core of courses that span the product development cycle and then allows students to customize the rest of their degree to fit their chosen industry or path. The core courses cover topics such as customer acquisition, technical market analysis, product life cycle, intellectual property, prototyping, iterative development, product design, user testing, and manufacturing. 
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
