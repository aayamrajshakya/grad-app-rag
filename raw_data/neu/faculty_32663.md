#  Seo Eun "Sunny"Yang 
Assistant Professor of Political Science and Communication Studies 
College of Social Science and Humanities, College of Arts, Media and Design 
Seo Eun Yang (phonetic: Saw-Uhn Yang, nickname: Sunny) (she/her) is a political scientist specializing in graph/network theory, deep learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision (CV). Her research lies at the intersection of political communication, political psychology, and computational social science. Her primary focus revolves around photojournalism, visual politics, framing studies, and political neuroscience. The central questions driving her research are as follows: (1) How can we effectively integrate different types of data (such as images, text, and social networks) and extract their semantic meaning simultaneously? (2) How do media outlets, politicians, and institutions employ visual and verbal strategies to shape political meaning through framing processes? (3) How do individuals comprehend and interpret visual information, particularly in terms of neurological cognitive understanding and visual literacy?
Her previous research has involved developing novel machine-learning approaches for visual framing analysis. These methods have been instrumental in investigating how the media contributes to biased representations of social minorities. Seo Eun Yang completed her BE and MS in Statistics at Korea University and received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the Ohio State University.
