Associate Teaching Professor, Sociology 
Rachel Meyer’s areas of interest include work and labor, social class, political sociology, cultural sociology, social change, social movements, labor movements, U.S. labor history, and qualitative methods. Meyer’s research explores the relationship between political economy and working-class mobilization. Her focus is on how experiences of work and collective action shape working-class subjectivities. At Harvard University Meyer held positions as Lecturer and Associate Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Sociology and she was a Harvard College Fellow. Meyer’s current projects are on precarious workers and ‘flexible’ labor.

### Introduction to Sociology
#### SOCL 1101
Explores diverse social phenomena, from how people try to look their best in face-to-face interactions; to how race, gender, and class shape identities and social conditions; to how industrial capitalism came to dominate the world. Offers students an opportunity to gain a grasp of key sociological theories and empirical research on topics such as social order, social conflict, and social change, as well as learn to identify social forces that shape human behavior, explain how these forces affect individuals and social groups, and make valid predictions about how they may shape future behavior or events.
