# Computational Biology at Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Uncovering the secrets of life through the power of computation
  
Computational biology bridges the gap between computer science and life sciences. Khoury College researchers explore both fundamental and applied questions in all aspects of studies of living systems. Their interdisciplinary approach brings together multiple computer science disciplines, including machine learning, computer vision, statistics, data science, and data visualization, as well as connections to programming languages, mathematics, physics, and network sciences.
Computational biology uses the power of large and complex datasets generated by modern biotechnologies to make complex biological processes legible and to provide insight for life science researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and educators.

## Using biological data to explore fundamental questions
  
Computational biology fuels discoveries across a wide range of fields, including studies of genomes, proteomes, metabolomes, diagnosis and prognosis of disease, discovery of molecular mechanisms of disease, vaccines, and therapeutics, and advances toward personalized medicine. Computational biology is also providing insights into agriculture, climate science, and ecosystem analysis. 
## Sample research areas
  * Causal inference in biomolecular systems
  * Computational mass spectrometry-based proteomics
  * Macromolecular structure and function
  * Network biology and medicine
  * Studies of molecular mechanisms of disease
  * Variant and genome interpretation
  * Systems biology
  * Genomics
  * Biomedical imaging


## Current project highlights
Advancing Data Integration and Discovery in Biomedicine with the Bioregistry 
##  Advancing Data Integration and Discovery in Biomedicine with the Bioregistry 
This project aims to support the development, maintenance, and outreach efforts of the [Bioregistry](https://bioregistry.io/), a tool designed to facilitate data integration and standardization in biomedical research. We are developing a semi-automated curation framework to keep pace with the rapid introduction of new semantic spaces, harmonizing inconsistent registries, and developing new ways to access the Bioregistry through different formats, programming languages, and user interfaces. In parallel, we are expanding our training and outreach efforts to engage academic and industry groups, major academic publishers, and funding agencies to promote wider adoption of Bioregistry.  
Funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) under award 2023-329850. (2023-)

](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-024-02324-4)Authors:
Mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides broad and quantitative detection of the proteome, but its results are mostly presented as protein lists. Artificial intelligence approaches will exploit prior knowledge from literature and harmonize fragmented datasets to enable mechanistic and functional interpretation of proteomics experiments.

Authors:
Khoury College is leading work on a new open-source software tool, MSstats, designed for researchers working with quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics, a technology used to measure protein levels in samples. 
**[Improving transparency of computational tools for variant effect prediction](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-024-01821-8)** (Nature Genetics  
Authors:
Efforts to integrate computational tools for variant effect prediction into the process of clinical decision-making are in progress. However, for such efforts to succeed and help to provide more informed clinical decisions, it is necessary to enhance transparency and address the current limitations of computational predictors.
