## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Graduate Certificate in Learning Experience Design and Technology offers a practice-based exploration of the key skills required in the rapidly expanding field of learning design. Never before has the need for professionals with LXD expertise been so essential across all industry sectors. The certificate is designed to meet this need by grounding designers, educators, technologists, and other professionals in the art and science of effective learning design. Students will have the opportunity to build or strengthen design and technological skills that can be applied across PK–12, higher education, government, military, corporate, and nonprofit environments. Skills can be applied to learners of all ages and in online, mobile, virtual, face-to-face, and blended formats.
The program's innovative approach blends academic and workplace-based learning with a focus on how people learn, foundational learning design skills, and advanced learning design topics. Experiential opportunities are built into each course. Students will have the opportunity to develop an online portfolio of work to demonstrate their capacity to think strategically; put creative ideas into action using a variety of technologies; learning design environments that meet academic, personal, professional, and organizational goals; and interpret and clearly communicate results to stakeholders. Credits earned in this certificate may be used to satisfy some of the degree requirements of the Master of Professional Studies in Learning Experience Design and Technology program.
