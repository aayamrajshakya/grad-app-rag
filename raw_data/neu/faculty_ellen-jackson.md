#  EllenJackson
Assistant Teaching Professor in English 
Ellen (Elly) Jackson has been a writing instructor at Northeastern since 2005. She previously taught composition at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, NY. She holds an MFA from Stanford University and a BA from Webster College in St. Louis, MO, where she grew up.
With her husband, Tom, Elly has edited or co-authored several books on career development and resume writing, including The Perfect Resume, and Perfect Resume Strategies. She spent much of her early career in outplacement, delivering workshops across the US and in Europe during layoffs. In early 2009, when the recession turned the job market upside down, she returned briefly to this field to address employee needs, working with Right Management.
Elly’s son Andrew is a 2005 Northeastern graduate in journalism.
