2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Over the last two decades, construction in both the public and private sector has become increasingly complex, requiring construction and project managers to have a stronger skill base to be successful in acquiring and executing projects.
The Graduate Certificate in Construction Management is intended to serve owners’ representatives, consulting engineers, architects, design engineers, contractors, and subcontractors. Individuals who have a bachelor’s degree, but not necessarily in construction, and who have been identified by their companies as having high potential for advancement are also good candidates for this program.
Courses from this certificate may be applied toward the Master of Science in Project Management.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
