Professor of History 
Louise E. Walker is a historian of Mexico and Latin America. Her new book, _[Debts Unpaid: Two Centuries of Trouble and Conflict in Mexico’s Economy](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cambridge.org%2Fcore%2Fbooks%2Fdebts-unpaid%2F4EB390F44B8F4026326A97DA193A518D&data=05%7C02%7Cm.dolan%40northeastern.edu%7C766c86a08ceb49061ab608dda44af8b3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638847364092736940%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=nlOYnl2Pd%2FTjnSDg94CXQRt2U0yv%2FE5tVfI%2FVVMDZRU%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/debts-unpaid/4EB390F44B8F4026326A97DA193A518D.

It argues that conflicts over small-scale debts were a stress test for the economic order, showing how power struggles between debtors and creditors shaped economic transformation from the emergence of capitalist relations to the recent global financial crashes. She published an article based on this work in The American Historical Review titled [“Everyday Economic Justice: Mediating Small Claims in Mexico City, 1813-1863.”](https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/128/1/120/7098053?redirectedFrom=fulltext) Her research for Debts Unpaid has been supported by fellowships from the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Antiquarian Society, by the Berlin Prize from the American Academy in Berlin.
Professor Walker is the author of [Waking from the Dream: Mexico’s Middle Classes after 1968](https://www.sup.org/books?id=21531) (Stanford University Press, 2013). It examines how the middle classes shaped the history of economic and political crisis in the 1970s and 1980s, facilitating the emergence of neo-liberalism and the transition to democracy. Waking from the Dream won prizes and honors from the Latin American Studies Association, the Social Science History Association, and the Rocky Mountain Council for Latin American Studies.
Professor Walker is also co-editor the special journal dossier [“Spy Reports: Content, Methodology, and Historiography in Mexico’s Secret Police Archive,”](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rjil20/19/1) (Journal of Iberian and Latin American Research, 2013), which brings together historians from the first generation of scholars using this recently declassified archive and presents scholarly articles with transcriptions of related spy reports. And she co-edited [Latin America’s Middle Class: Unsettled Debates and New Histories](https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739168486) (Lexington Books, 2012), which raises new questions and revisits older debates about studying class and about the role of the middle classes in Latin American history.
Before coming to Northeastern University, Professor Walker was on the faculty at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and at the New School for Social Research in New York City. She teaches courses on colonial and modern Latin American history, social movements, natural disasters, and the history of capitalism.
