#  Global Pathways 
Your path to earning an advanced degree at a top-tier U.S. university
##  What is Global Pathways? 
Global Pathways is a program for international students who qualify academically but do not meet Northeastern’s English language admission requirements for their desired graduate degree program.
You can enroll in this program for one or two semesters before being admitted to your program of interest. Upon successful completion of the program requirements, you will be admitted to your graduate degree program of choice.
