## Northeastern University Public Evaluation Lab
## Who we are
NU-PEL is an interdisciplinary, multigenerational lab comprised of faculty and student teams conducting culturally responsive and community-engaged evaluation research. The lab is a collaboration of the [Institute on Health Equity and Social Justice Research (IHESJR)](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/institute-for-health-equity-and-social-justice-research/) in Bouvé College of Health Sciences and the [Center on Crime, Race, and Justice](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/crj/).
## What we do
The overall vision of NU-PEL is to build community-academic partnerships to improve the well-being of communities through evaluation research and support. Driven by social justice and Community-Based Participatory Research frameworks, we bring together expertise and resources to advance our three pillars.
## NU-PEL’s Three Pillars
1
Build collaborations and share evaluation knowledge and expertise across Northeastern global community
2
Provide evaluation and consultative services to community organizations with the mission of improving the health, well-being, and safety of the people impacted by these organizations
3
Train undergraduate and graduate students in the techniques of program evaluation through experiential learning opportunities

Collectively, we have received funding from national, state, and local agencies including NSF, SAMHSA, NIJ, U.S. Department of Justice, NIH, NEA, Massachusetts Department of Public Health, Massachusetts Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, and Boston Public Health Commission.
