# Texts of Taste
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
_[Texts of Taste](http://www.textsoftaste.com/)_ is a digital archive project which focuses on annotated, marked-up, or otherwise notated nineteenth-century American recipes. The goal of the project is to bring together annotated recipes spread across various institutional collections so that they may be digitally available for research. Locating annotated recipes in archives and collections can be difficult. While many archives collect cookbooks, many of these books have not been digitized and whether or not annotations are noted in metadata is not always guaranteed. In addition, recipes in the nineteenth century were printed in cookbooks, but also just as often were printed in newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets and collected in diaries, scrapbooks, and commonplace books. The ways in which recipes could appear in many different forms of print or book media presents unique challenges to researchers interested in studying them.
For these reasons, Texts of Taste
