2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Semiconductor Engineering, offered by the Institute for NanoSystems Innovation—along with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, and the Department of Chemical Engineering in the College of Engineering—and the D’Amore-McKim School of Business, is designed to meet the burgeoning demand for skilled professionals in the semiconductor industry. This cutting-edge program aims to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in this rapidly evolving field.
The national landscape is witnessing a significant uptick in interest in expanding the talent pool within the semiconductor sector, particularly following the enactment of the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This pivotal legislation has catalyzed a marked increase in the demand for engineers, drawing considerable attention from a wide array of companies to the semiconductor industry. There is a need for skilled workers to build new plants to increase and localize manufacturing capacity, design chips, and the tools that make the chips. This program is strategically positioned to address this growing need, offering a comprehensive educational experience that prepares our graduates to lead and innovate in this critical domain.
