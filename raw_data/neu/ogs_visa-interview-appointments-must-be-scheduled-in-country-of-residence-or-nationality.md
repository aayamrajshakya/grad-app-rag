#  Visa Interview Appointments Should Be Scheduled in Country of Residence or Nationality 
September 8, 2025 
On September 6, 2025, the U.S. Department of State (DoS) announced that effective immediately, applicants for U.S. nonimmigrant visas, including F-1, F-2, J-1, and J-2 visas, "should schedule their visa interview appointments at the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in their country of nationality or residence".
If you are from a country where the U.S. is not currently conducting routine nonimmigrant visa operations, you must apply at a designated alternate location, unless you reside elsewhere. A full list of designated locations is available on the [U.S. Department of State website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/adjudicating-niv-applicants-in-their-country-of-residence.html).
**Important Notes**
  * **Residence Requirement** : You must be able to demonstrate that you reside in the country where you are applying, if applying based on residency.


  * **Existing Appointments** : If you already have a scheduled visa appointment, DoS has stated that it should (generally) not be cancelled


**A reminder for current students/scholars:** Because the F-1/J-1 visa does not determine your eligibility to remain in the U.S., once you have arrived in the U.S., it is not a problem if your F/J visa expires. As such, OGS does not that you travel for the sole purpose of renewing your F-1/J-1 visa
If you must depart the U.S. and require a new (not "renewal") visa to re-enter, please anticipate potentially lengthy visa appointment delays and increased scrutiny on social media content.
