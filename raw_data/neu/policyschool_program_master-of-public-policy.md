The Master of Public Policy (MPP) is the industry standard among public policy professionals. It emphasizes the analysis of data and other relevant information to assess public problems, develop appropriate policy responses, and evaluate program effectiveness. Northeastern University’s MPP program is dedicated to developing policies that create more just, equitable, and resilient cities.
Students can take MPP courses online or on campus in Boston, Arlington, or (starting in the Fall 2025 term) Oakland. This flexibility allows learners to exchange diverse views, consult with faculty, and work collaboratively no matter where they are in the world. MPP graduates enter careers as policy analysts, researchers, consultants, program evaluators, and policymakers in a broad range of public, nonprofit, and private sector settings.
> “I chose the MPP program because public policy decisions affect every part of our lives, and I knew that I wanted to be a part of affecting policy change on principles of equity and improving the lives of underprivileged, underserved communities. . . .The MPP program allowed me to better understand the nuances of policy creation and the factors that prevent or spur policy development.”
> Katie Kalugin, MPP ’18
