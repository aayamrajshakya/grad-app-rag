2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence program is designed to give students a comprehensive framework for AI with specialization in one of five areas: vision, intelligent interaction, robotics and agent-based systems, machine learning, and knowledge management and reasoning. Students may choose from three options: specialization, thesis, or coursework only. Students will engage in an extensive core intended to develop depth in all core concepts that build a foundation for AI theory and practice. Students will also be given the opportunity to build on the core knowledge of AI by taking a variety of elective courses, selected from colleges throughout campus, to explore key contextual areas or more complex technical applications. Program graduates will be well positioned to attain research and development positions in a rapidly growing field or to progress into doctoral-degree-related fields.
The Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence is comprised of eight courses: five core courses, two electives to be chosen from one of five specialization areas or coursework option, and one elective. The core courses are designed and developed by Khoury College faculty. Elective courses consist of graduate courses offered in Khoury and other partner colleges, including College of Arts, Media and Design; College of Engineering; College of Science; and College of Social Sciences and Humanities.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
