Computer engineering PhD candidate Ana Veroneze Solórzano is redefining what’s possible in high-performance computing (HPC). Recently awarded the prestigious George Michael Memorial HPC Fellowship, Solórzano is developing tools that make supercomputers both eco-friendly and more secure for users. Her incentive-based energy-saving system on Japan’s Fugaku supercomputer cut energy use by more than 13%, while her research on differential privacy helps protect user data in shared computing environments. Through her pioneering work, Solórzano is helping shape a future where powerful computing can advance discovery without compromising sustainability or equity.
