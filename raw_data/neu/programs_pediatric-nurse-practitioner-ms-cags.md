### The need for holistic and clinically exemplary pediatric nurse practitioners has never been more profound.
The goal of the Pediatric Nurse Practitioner (PNP) programs is to prepare Pediatric Nurse Practitioners who provide evidence-based, comprehensive, family-centered healthcare to infants, children, adolescents, and their families. The program provides a broad background of advanced pathophysiology, advanced general and pediatric pharmacology, and advanced health assessment.
In addition, theoretical basis of best practice and diagnostic clinical reasoning skills are taught and developed as students learn the advanced practice provider management and technology skills needed to care for children across the continuum of care.

## Experiential Learning
Clinical immersion in advanced nursing practice is a major focus of this program. Our long history of partnering with local and regional hospitals and clinical sites serving diverse and underserved community ensures access to clinical and research opportunities with at-risk pediatric populations. Our many hospital and community affiliations have included:
  * ABCD Boston
  * Boston Children’s Hospital
  * Boston Medical Center
