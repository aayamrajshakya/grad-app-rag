#  Business, Entrepreneurship, & Leadership 
Our students develop as innovators and leaders not only by our distinctive approach to experiential education and research, but also through novel initiatives in entrepreneurship, business, and leadership.

Engineering Entrepreneurship 
The Michael J. and Ann Sherman Center for Engineering Entrepreneurship Education provides education on tools, concepts, and resources to foster creativity and the ability to develop commercially viable ideas. It offers a host of programs and resources, including semester-long courses in product innovation and design, an entrepreneurial engineering minor, an entrepreneurial mentor program, a student-run product development studio, and a co-op program for students to work on their own new ventures. The Center is open to students across the University and also partners with other organizations within Northeastern’s vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem.

Engineering and Business
With the Edward G. Galante Engineering Business Program, engineering students have the opportunity to complement their technical engineering education with business skills and enriching networking and growth opportunities. Students earn a bachelor’s and master’s degree as well as an Engineering Business Certificate, of which four courses can be applied to an MBA at Northeastern.

Engineering Leadership
The Gordon Engineering Leadership Program is a National Academy of Engineering-recognized institute offering a graduate certificate in Engineering Leadership which can also be taken in combination with most engineering master’s degrees in the College of Engineering. For undergraduate students, a supplementary curriculum to the co-op program is offered to make engineering leadership development a focus of the co-op experience.
