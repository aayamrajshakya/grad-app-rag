For students interested in pursuing financial assistance or educational loans, additional educational costs, known as Cost of Attendance (COA) components, can be included in the calculation of aid and loan eligibility. Components may include food, housing, books, course materials, supplies, equipment, transportation, personal expenses, and the cost of obtaining a first professional licensure. You can find comprehensive details on Student Financial Service’s website. Please keep in mind that COA can vary significantly depending on academic program, enrollment intensity, and individual circumstances.
Please note that courses taken outside of the student's home college may be billed at the per-credit rate of the college offering the course.
