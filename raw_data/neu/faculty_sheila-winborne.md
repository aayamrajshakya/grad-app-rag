Teaching Professor of Religion 
Sheila Winborne is a Teaching Professor of Religion in the Department of Philosophy and Religion. She received her Ph.D. in the study of religion from Harvard University (specialization theology and the visual arts), an MTS (concentration religion and culture) from Harvard Divinity School, an MA in the humanities (concentration philosophy and art) from Old Dominion University, and a BA (studio art major, philosophy minor) from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.
She teaches interdisciplinary courses in religion, philosophy, race, and film. Her research involves analysis of visual culture of the late nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries.

She has practical creative experiences in each of the media about which she teaches and does research.
