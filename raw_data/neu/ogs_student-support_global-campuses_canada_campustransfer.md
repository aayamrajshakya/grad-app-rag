##  Process for Transferring Between Canadian Campuses 
1. Speak with your Academic Advisor
Different colleges may have different requirements and policies on campus transfer. Please speak with your current Academic Advisor to understand the requirement and policy of your college as well as make sure there will be courses available on your desired campus.
2. Reach out to OGS Canada
Once you confirm that your campus transfer can be supported, reach out to the OGS Canada team to understand the process for applying for a study permit to study in Canada and eligibility for PGWP. Email OGS Canada: [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#e5aaa2b6a6848b848184a481938c968c8b82a58b8a97918d8084969180978bcb808190)
3. Submit Campus Transfer Request
Work with your current Academic Advisor to submit the Campus Transfer Request. Click [here](https://service.northeastern.edu/registrar?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB000020000&sys_kb_id=f37e1a5d8799fd94ba9a0fad0ebb3562&spa=1) to access the Campus Transfer Request Form.
4. Email Campus Transfer Form to OGS Canada
Once your campus transfer request is approved by your college, please email the Campus Transfer form signed by your academic advisor/program manager to [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#eda2aabeae8c838c898cac899b849e84838aad83829f9985888c9e99889f83c3888998). Please ensure you use your NU Student Email and you include your Full Name, NUID, your Program of Study, and the Address you will use for your study permit from in your email.
**5. Receive the POA letter and Apply for a NEW Study Permit and Co-op Work Permit**
OGS Canada will verify your campus transfer request with your college and issue you the Proof of Acceptance Letter via email. This process may take 3-5 business days. You will use this letter to apply for a **new Study Permit**. See more information about Change Your School as a Post-secondary Student [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools.html#s2). You cannot start your program at the destination campus until you are issued the new study permit that names the destination campus.
Since Co-op is an integral part of the education program, the co-op work permit is typically issued to allow students to participate in co-op program at a specific institution. Therefore, if you are transferring from another institution to a NU Canadian campus, you need to apply for a new co-op work permit to be able to do co-op at NU. This includes transferring between the two NU Canadian campuses. Your co-op work permit is not valid if it was issued for a different institution or different NU campus.
6. Register for Courses
Once your Study Permit has been approved, reach out to your academic advisor for information on course registration and next steps.
