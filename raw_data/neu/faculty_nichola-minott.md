#  NicholaMinott
Associate Teaching Professor in International Affairs, Political Science, and School of Public Policy and Urban Affairs 
Dr. Nichola Minott holds a PhD from The Fletcher School at Tufts University, where she was the recipient of a Boren Fellowship and participated in the Aceh Research Training Institute. Dr. Minott is originally from Jamaica, West Indies and spent her formative years in Bronx, NY. She also served as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Paraguay, South America. Through her experiences living in communities impacted by limited resources and economic precariousness, she developed an interest in international environmental policy and its impacts on marginalized communities.
Based on her personal and professional experiences and interests in environmental policy, international security and conflict, Dr. Minott pursued a PhD exploring the impacts of environmental disasters on civil conflicts, specifically the 2004 tsunami and its effect on the civil conflicts in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Dr. Minott has been a Visiting Scholar/Professor in the International Studies Program, at Boston College where she taught courses on International Environmental Science and Policy, Global Climate Politics, Disasters and Conflicts, and Conflict and Natural Resources. Additionally, she has taught classes at Tufts University and Merrimack College. Dr. Minott has been a panelist at events for The Smithsonian Museum’s education programs and at Boston College on the topic of Climate Change and Justice. Her research interests and teaching focuses on the nexus between conflict and natural resources; global climate policy and politics and examining approaches to race/justice and environmental agreements.
