## Earn two advanced degrees at once
Pharmacy majors enrolled in the joint Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD)/Master of Public Health (MPH) Program have the opportunity to take graduate courses in the MPH Program while earning their PharmD. 
Up to 15 credit hours of these courses count toward both their PharmD and MPH, allowing these students to earn their MPH in a shorter amount of time than it would take to earn it separately from their PharmD.

## Curriculum
Students enrolled in the joint program take classes that meet the curriculum requirements for both a PharmD and MPH. All PharmD/MPH graduates will fulfill the same competencies that guide the MPH program.
PharmD/MPH students work with advisors from both the School of Pharmacy and the MPH Program to design a flexible program of study that enables them to use their electives strategically to begin graduate MPH coursework. 
Depending on your matriculation year into the PharmD program, the number of elective slots and the semesters in which they are available will vary. Generally, your program of study will include:

MPH core courses should be taken during most available PharmD elective slots.
A maximum of 5 MPH core courses can be taken by undergraduate Pharmacy majors (Pharmacy majors are considered “undergraduates” until the summer of their P3 year).
### MPH Core Course
Biostatistics in Public Health
Environmental Health
Introduction to Epidemiology
Public Health Administration and Policy
Society, Behavior, and Health

### Advanced Pharmacy Practical Experience
PharmD students are required to complete 6 six-week APPE rotations in their final PharmD year.   
One of those rotations can be a public health-orientated placement.
Once the PharmD is conferred, students remain enrolled in the MPH degree program, focusing exclusively on remaining MPH requirements. 
Students have the option of completing the remaining MPH coursework as full-time students or as part-time students, where length of program is dependent upon the student’s chosen course load.
