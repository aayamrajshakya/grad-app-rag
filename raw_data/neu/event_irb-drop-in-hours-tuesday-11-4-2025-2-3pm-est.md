This is a great way to get any IRB questions you might have answered. Attendees can join and leave at their leisure. Sessions will be one-on-one or small group discussions of questions brought by attendees. Questions will be addressed on a first-come, first-served basis. Please note, during these sessions, the IRB staff won’t review specific language or research studies, as these sessions are not intended to replace the pre-review process.
