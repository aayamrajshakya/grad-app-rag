Uncertainty about the economy, health care, and the labor market. Ethnic conflicts in an era of rapid globalization. Concern for the environment. Shifting gender arrangements, as work and family come into conflict. Violence in schools, and even houses of worship.
Never has there been a greater need for sociological research focused on the problems and issues of our time. Study sociology and anthropology at Northeastern University, and equip yourself with the practical and theoretical tools needed to address the complex social and cultural issues the U.S. confronts in a period of far-reaching social change.

Many of the faculty in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology have additional interests and are affiliated with other departments on campus, including environmental studies; law, policy, and society; Latino, Latin American and Caribbean studies; African American studies; international affairs, Jewish studies; and criminal justice. Students who wish to work with faculty in other disciplines are encouraged to enlist the aid of the sociology graduate director or their advisers in contacting individual faculty members.
To ensure that PhD students become not only effective researchers and writers but also successful instructors, we offer teacher-training with the aim of instilling a skill set that prospective academic employers find desirable through the University’s [Center for Advancing Teaching and Learning Through Research](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.northeastern.edu%2Flearningresearch%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ca.waterson%40northeastern.edu%7Cde057bf41e8b4f86f91408dcb0b92098%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638579556362912005%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=zqStaoZ0cMY4bn1mh7q215MywmAkRQQdq06bVRa14C4%3D&reserved=0) (CATLR).

In addition, the department and affiliated centers often host national and international visitors, speakers, and conferences, further enhancing educational opportunities for our graduate students. Finally, each year the department offers a set of workshops on academic writing, teaching, grant writing, the job market, and other “professional development” matters.
