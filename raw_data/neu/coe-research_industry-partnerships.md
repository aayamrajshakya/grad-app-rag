Cooperative Education Student Hiring and Employer Partnerships
Our signature cooperative education program (co-op) is both good business and good for business. With talented young workers on staff on whom you can depend, your experienced employees can turn their attention to developing new strategic initiatives. By nurturing young talent, your company is laying the foundation for those who will guide the work in years to come. Co-op employers gain cost-effectiveness, support, a pipeline for future full-time talent, and the opportunity to engage with budding talents in the field.

Targeted Research
Industry and government partner with Northeastern for basic and applied research. The reason is simple: they know that at Northeastern, our two guiding principles are interdisciplinary collaboration and engagement with the real world. These principles are reflected in our research programs, which are driven by critical issues in materials, processes, systems and infrastructure. Our research collaborations are a win-win-win: our partners receive knowledge and products tailored to their needs, our researchers validate and extend their work, and our students receive training and experience to become the next generation of effective technologists.
