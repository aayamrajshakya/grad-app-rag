### Overview
Computers are powerful machines, and much of our world is oriented around interfacing with them. Computers only understand instructions in 0s and 1s (called binary code), but very few people can write instructions using 0s and 1s. Instead, most people use tools that others have written to interact with computers. These are both general and specialized tools for interacting with computers: general tools, such as programming languages, are more flexible but more difficult to learn; specialized tools are easier to learn, but only do a limited number of tasks (e.g., Word for word processing or GIS tools for working with maps). 
In this glossary, we define some tools that enable social scientists and humanists to productively use computers, as well as other related concepts.

### Key Terms
Application Programming Interface (API)
An API, or application programming interface
Citation Software
Citation software
Computational Text Analysis
Computational text analysis
For example, computers can count words or phrases (sometimes referred to as nGrams, where n= the number of words in the phrase), automatically label the parts of speech in a text (such as nouns, verbs, and prepositions), trace linguistic patterns using collocation and word trees, and perform more complex forms of analysis like topic modeling.
Digital Archives
Digital archives[Library of Congress Digital Collections](https://www.loc.gov/collections/) or the [Washington State Archives. ](https://www.digitalarchives.wa.gov/)
Digital Ethics
Digital ethics
Digital ethics lead researchers to make informed decisions when they gather and analyze data produced online; guide users to think critically about the tools they use; help teachers choose the best pedagogical platforms for their students; shape creators’ choices for gathering and disseminating information; and highlight the potentially harmful ways data is collected, stored, and analyzed.

Excel
Excel
While Excel is not the only spreadsheet program (other options include Numbers for MacOS users and open-access programs like Google Sheets and LibreOffice), it is often used in professions that deal with quantitative data because it can quickly organize data, and enables statistical analyses and data visualizations. However, researchers who choose to work with Excel should be aware that its proprietary data format and auto-formatting behaviors are serious limitations that should be considered carefully. Excel is not free.
Geospatial/GIS
Geospatial GIS, or geographic information systems
Git
Git
GitHub
GitHub
What makes GitHub particularly useful for coding is its interface, which displays the inputs and outputs of particular codes and encourages documentation from coders in the form of README files. GitHub can be collaborative in that multiple users can work on one repository, but the repository can also be published and used by only one person, while others can “fork” (a form of downloading) the code and information in that repository.
Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
An alternative way of interacting with the computer is through the command line, which only allows keyed instructions instead of clicking icons with a cursor.
Integrated Development Environments (IDE)

Network Analysis

Notebooks
Notebooks, or computational notebooks/essays
Programming Languages
Programming languages
Procedural programming languages are written as a series of instructions that the computer follows (e.g., the C language). Object-oriented programming languages define data structures, data types, and operations that can be performed on these data objects. Because of their orientation toward data objects, object-oriented languages are more popular for data analysis in the social sciences and humanities.
Often coders use Integrated Development Environments to facilitate the use of a programming language; this enables users to write and run code, view variables, and inspect output in the same application. More recently, those using programming for data analysis often display and share their analyses through notebooks, which integrate narrative, code, and output in one document. These documents are sometimes called computational essays.

Web Scraping
Web scraping
When web scraping, it is best to use an API whenever possible. Some websites prohibit web scraping and/or the use of robots. Even if the websites allow web scraping, be responsible and do not overload the servers. Some web scraping tools include TAGs, Python, R, and Javascript.
