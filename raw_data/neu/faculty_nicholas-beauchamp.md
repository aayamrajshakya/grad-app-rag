#  NicholasBeauchamp
Associate Professor of Political Science 
Nick Beauchamp is a core faculty member of the Network Science Institute and the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science. His research uses techniques from natural language processing, machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and network analysis to examine how discussion, argument and deliberation affect political opinion in domains such as legislatures, campaigns, the judiciary, and social media. Recent work has included: using Twitter data to model deliberation and to predict political polls; tracing hate language evolution in individuals online; modeling presidential debates; using neural networks to predict votes from bill text; designing machine-human collaborations to forecast world events; and algorithmically generated persuasive text. He is currently working on a larger series of projects that model political deliberation as the strategic exchange of ideas drawn from complex mental networks of interlinked beliefs.
