2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Our team is committed to helping students and families understand the student account and associated billing statements, important dates and deadlines, payment options, and overall financial responsibilities associated with a Northeastern University education. 
## Billing Policy
Tuition bills are only generated electronically each semester and are available via the [Student Hub](https://me.northeastern.edu/). Paper bills are not generated. Balances are due prior to the start of the term. For additional information regarding the e-bill, please visit the [Billing & Payments Frequently Asked Questions webpage](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/billing-faq/).
Students must authorize parent or guardian access to view billing information and make payment via the Family Portal. For more information, visit the Northeastern[ Accounts website.](https://accounts.northeastern.edu/family-other-accounts/)
Discrepancies in your bill should be addressed in writing via the [Student Financial Services Inquiry form ](https://northeastern.service-now.com/sfs?id=sfs_ask_a_question&sys_id=dfb56efd8731f15011b72fc5dabb35a8). Include your name, Northeastern ID, Northeastern email address, dollar amount in question, date of invoice, and any other relevant information. 
Responses will be sent to the student’s Northeastern email address. If there is a discrepancy in your bill, pay the undisputed part of the bill to avoid responsibility for any late fees or financial holds.
## Student Financial Responsibility Agreement 
As compelled by federal law, all students who enroll in classes at Northeastern are required to complete and accept the [Student Financial Responsibility Agreement](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/sfra/), which acknowledges their obligations and understanding of the financial policies of the university. This will be available for completion after July 1 each academic year. The SFRA informs students of the financial responsibilities associated with enrolling for classes and explains the potential consequences that may result if a student fails to meet those obligations. This agreement must be completed once per academic year and is located on the Student Hub. Failure to complete the SFRA will result in a hold that prevents registration. 
## Past-Due and Delinquent Balances
When a student fails to make payment on a balance owed, the university may initiate a series of progressively severe actions, including but not limited to:
  * Assessment of late fees


  * Placement of a financial hold preventing:
    * Course registration or schedule changes
    * Participation in global study programs
    * Release of diplomas


  * Initiation of collections activity, including referral to third-party collection agencies


  * Collection fees


  * Involuntary withdrawal from the university


Students withdrawn for nonpayment remain financially liable for all outstanding tuition and fees. In addition, the student is responsible for all reasonable collection costs and any legal fees incurred by the university during the collection process.
### International Students
For students in F-1 or J-1 visa status, failure to resolve delinquent balances in a timely manner may negatively impact immigration status, potentially affecting eligibility to remain in or reenter the United States. Students who face status issues due to failure to resolve delinquent balances should contact [the Office of Global Services.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/)
## Late Fee Policy
Northeastern has implemented a policy regarding late fees. If the balance on a student’s account remains unpaid, 30 days after the initial bill due date the university will impose a late fee of $150 on the student’s account. If the student’s account balance remains unpaid after the initial late fee is assessed, the university will impose an additional 1% late charge once a month, until the balance is paid. If delinquency continues to a subsequent term, the late fee assessment cycle will start again. There will be an initial late fee, in the amount of $150, then an additional 1% late charge once a month until the balance is paid.
If a student or payer wishes to dispute a late fee assessment, they may review and submit the [Late Fee Removal Request form](https://service.northeastern.edu/sfs?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=af129a76dba03c10fab7440805961938&sysparm_category=d5e02da3db2f9010e783f3671d96195f).
## Collection Partners
As outlined in the [SFRA](https://service.northeastern.edu/sfs?id=kb_article&sys_id=6da5a0dc978912905a68bd8c1253af0c), student account balances that remain unpaid will be placed initially with ECSI, Northeastern’s precollections partner. If a student account balance remains unpaid, the past-due student account balance will then be placed with a collections agency (Reliant or Radius). Information about Northeastern’s collections partners can be found [here](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/collections-partners/).
## Tuition Adjustments for Dropping a Course
If a student drops one or more courses, they are eligible for a full reversal of the course tuition as long as the course(s) were dropped before the course drop deadline. Once the deadline to drop a course without a W grade passes, the student is responsible for 100% of tuition and associated charges—no partial refunds will be provided. Refer to the [academic calendar](https://registrar.northeastern.edu/group/calendar/) for course registration dates. Please see the Financial Aid page for information on how financial aid will be impactedfor withdrawing from or dropping a course. 
Credit balances will be refunded to the student unless otherwise directed by the student or the bill payer. Note the following exceptions: 
  * Payment plans and supplemental loans: Credit balances created from supplemental loans or overpayment to the monthly payment plan will be refunded to the bill payer on record unless a completed Refund Authorization form, stating that funds may be released directly to the student, is received from that borrower. Please note that anticipated credits are funds that have not been received by the university and, therefore, cannot be refunded.


  * International payments: Credit balances created from an international payment must be returned to the originating bank by the payment method used. 


## Tuition Adjustments for Official University Withdrawal 
If a student submits an official withdrawal from the university, they may be eligible for a tuition adjustment based on the official withdrawal date recorded. Note that nonattendance does not constitute official withdrawal. 
Tuition adjustments vary according to the duration of the course. 
Please also see the Financial Aid page for information on how aid is impacted by withdrawal.
Information on the university’s Emergency Leave of Absence policy is located in the Graduate Catalog[ ](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/)in the “Academic Policies and Procedures” section.
