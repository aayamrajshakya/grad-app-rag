#  Graduate Co-op 
Offering cooperative education for over 100 years and [ranked No. 1](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/internship-programs) in internships/co-ops by US News and World Report, Northeastern is a leader in experiential learning and is one of only a few that offer a cooperative education program for graduate students. Cooperative education at the graduate level is not just a way for students to gain real-world experience, but it is also a way to challenge, network, expand, and fine-tune their knowledge within their respective industry, and foster career development. Northeastern also offers comprehensive [career support ](https://careers.northeastern.edu/collections/coe/)for students. Learn more about us on

Graduate Cooperative Education 
Graduate Cooperative Education
The goals of cooperative education are to:
  * Apply knowledge and skills in new, authentic contexts.
  * Develop new knowledge and skills.
  * Integrate and use the deepened knowledge and skills in your academic programs.
  * Reflect on and articulate how you used your knowledge and skills, how you gained new knowledge and skills, and how theory and practice work together.


Over 1400 graduate students (primarily international students) in Northeastern’s Graduate School of Engineering were hired on co-op for their highly sought-after technical skills in positions in the U.S. and globally during the 2023 academic year. Co-op is part of the fabric of our academic program, and we have a dedicated co-op team, including a global co-op team, that prepares students for the cooperative education experience through resume building, developing interview skills, and guiding professional development. Co-op positions are paid aligning with market wages. Co-op positions are available nationally and [globally.](https://careers.northeastern.edu/students/student-co-op/global-co-op/)
Toggle Accordion  How Co-op Works 
All graduate students interested in participating in co-op should take ENCP 6000 (MGEN students), ENCP 6100: Introduction to Co-op (departmental MS students) or ENCP 7100: Career Management for PhD Engineers (PhD students). Waivers to this requirement may be granted to students who have completed an equivalent course at Northeastern or at another institution or who have worked on a full-time basis for at least two years physically located in the United States (or in Canada for Canadian campuses only). Waivers may be requested through the Intent to Co-op form, distributed to students via email before the deadline for each semester (September, January, and May).
PhD students can participate in one co-op experience at the university. This timing is very personal and should be discussed with the student’s research advisor, who will also need to provide written approval to the co-op department. Please refer to the [website for ](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/phd-co-op-and-internships/)[PhD students](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/phd-co-op-and-internships/)
for more information and details about the experiential learning opportunities available to PhD students.
Northeastern provides a broad-based network of support that helps students prepare for and get the most from co-op, including an academic advisor, a co-op coordinator, and if applicable, a global co-op coordinator. Your co-op coordinator will guide you through the co-op process and help you identify various positions that best match your skills and career interests. After you’ve completed your co-op assignment, you will be asked to reflect upon your experience and explain how it integrates with your classroom studies. The reflection process may include various options such as one-on-one meetings with your co-op coordinator, writing assignments/or presentations, and online reflections throughout your co-op.
Graduate students can complete co-ops that are 4, 6, or 8 months in duration in alignment with the academic semesters.
