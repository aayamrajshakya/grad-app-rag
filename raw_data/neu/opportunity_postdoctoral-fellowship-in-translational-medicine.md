The PhRMA Foundation’s Postdoctoral Fellowship in Translational Medicine supports individuals (U.S. and non-U.S. citizens) engaged in a multidisciplinary, collaborative research training program at an accredited U.S. university that will extend their credentials in translational medicine.
Letter of Intent Deadline: May 1, 2024, at 12:00 p.m. (noon) ET
Duration
Applications will be accepted for a minimum of one year and a maximum of two years of stipend support.
Funding
$60,000 per year, up to two years
Eligibility
  * Applicants (U.S. and non-U.S. citizens) must currently be in a PhD and/or MS degree-granting accredited U.S. university.
  * Applicants must have a firm commitment from a research supervisor or sponsor at their university.
  * Applicants must hold a PhD, PharmD, MD, or appropriate terminal research doctorate. If you do not hold one at the time of application submission, please state in your extended letter when you expect to receive it, as it must be received before funding can begin. Funding can begin as early as January 1, 2025, or as late as August 1, 2025. 
  * You are not eligible if your doctoral degree was granted before January 1, 2022.
  * Applicants who have taken leave from their career (e.g., parenting of a child, childbirth, long-term care of a parent/spouse/child/dependent, personal health issues) that puts them outside of the eligibility time frame can reach out to PhRMA Foundation staff ahead of their LOI submission to determine their eligibility. The Foundation aims to be flexible and adjust these time frames if appropriate.
  * Applicants who are applying for funds to support postdoctoral work in the laboratory where their graduate work was performed will be given lower preference. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to gain new skills and therefore an ideal candidate will be conducting their research in a new laboratory and not where their graduate work was performed.
  * Only one postdoctoral applicant per lab may apply for this award. If multiple applicants apply, they will automatically be ineligible. Potential applicants and their mentors and/or lab managers should decide who should apply.
  * The Foundation will not consider multiple applications for similar efforts on the same project. For instance, if a predoc, postdoc, and faculty member from the same lab are all submitting applications for proposed efforts on the same project, the efforts must be separate activities and not duplicative.
