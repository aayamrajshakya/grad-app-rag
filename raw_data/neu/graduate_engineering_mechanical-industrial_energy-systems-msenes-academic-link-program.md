For program contact information, please visit [the College of Engineering website](https://mie.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/ms-enes/). 
Designing and implementing optimal methods to produce and utilize energy is one of the most pressing global issues today. Finding ways to implement these solutions that are sustainable and marketable is key. The energy systems Academic Link (AL) program is meant to provide engineering students who have not had any exposure to thermal sciences with the foundation skills necessary to create and implement energy solutions. Students begin the program by taking two core courses that cover topics across thermal sciences and math along with the general energy systems curriculum. 
The preparatory core courses introduce students to the fundamentals that are necessary to be successful in the energy system program. AL courses are integrated with our multidisciplinary energy system curriculum that integrates engineering, business, and policy. Our curriculum is flexibly designed with a set of core courses in engineering and finance complemented by a range of electives across five different academic colleges. Our core and elective courses are designed to help to prepare students to lead the efforts to implement energy systems solutions that have a long-term positive effect on businesses and communities. 
## Graduate Certificate Options
Students enrolled in a master's degree have the opportunity to also pursue one of the many engineering graduate certificate options in addition to or in combination with the MS degree. Students should consult their faculty advisor regarding these [options](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/graduate-certificate-programs/).
### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Master's Degree in Energy Systems with Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Energy Systems in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/multidisciplinary/engineering-leadership-graduate-certificate/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 44-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 28 hours of advisor-approved energy systems technical courses. 
## General Requirements
A minimum of 40 semester hours must be earned toward completion of the degree. A minimum grade-point average of 3.000 is required over all courses applied toward the degree.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
