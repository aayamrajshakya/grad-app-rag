### [Topics in Literary Study: Realism in Victorian Literature ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/social-sciences-humanities/english/english-phd/#text)
#### ENGL 7351
English realist fiction rose to prominence in the Victorian period and has since become one of the most influential, and contested, types of fiction in English. In this class, we will read both canonical and lesser-known Victorian realist novels as well as twentieth and twenty-first century critical definitions and analyses of, and debates over, the term and its objects. Realism is both a genre (Middlemarch is a realist novel) and a mode or style (Great Expectations contains elements of both realism and romance). Students will have an opportunity, in a final research paper, to test their understandings of the term and its utility on one of the works that we read.
