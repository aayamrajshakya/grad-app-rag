Program Benefits

Experiential learning 
Experience-powered learning is a key feature of the program. In the core curriculum, you’ll work on two real-world business challenges: one focused on competing in a changing business environment and the other on a business social responsibility challenge. The program further includes five credits of elective experience-powered learning segments you choose from a set of options.
In the first challenge, you’ll take on the role of a C-level executive grappling with setting strategy in a changing business world. You’ll work in a team with fellow students and consult with current or recently retired senior executives playing the part of CEO—and then make your recommendations. Based on feedback from the CEO, you’ll make adjustments. In the process, you’ll deepen your knowledge of the business subjects you’ve studied, learn how to apply that knowledge to critical issues in real-world situations, and hone skills, particularly the human skills so pivotal to business success.
All courses in the core include business fundamentals but also go beyond, delving into emerging issues and ideas in business. Courses also include business social responsibility elements and develop human skills critical to success in any aspect of business, particularly as digitalization proceeds apace. Innovation-driven strategy and global strategy are among the core courses.
