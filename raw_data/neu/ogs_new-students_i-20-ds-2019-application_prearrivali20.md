#  Students Studying in The United States 
All admitted students who will be studying with an F-1 visa need an I-20 form in order to move forward with the visa process. 
##  What is an I-20? 
An I-20 is a U.S. immigration document issued by a university to certify that an F-1 student has met admission requirements and has proof of sufficient financial resources for their studies. An I-20 is required to apply for an F-1 student visa at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate abroad.
Newly admitted international students that have paid a deposit and completed all requirements in their admissions portal should request an I-20. The Office of Global Services (OGS) encourages you to submit your initial I-20 request as soon as possible
##  Who is an Initial student? 
New international students coming from outside the U.S. that are seeking F-1 visa status.
##  Who is a Transfer Student? 
If a student currently has an Active Student and Exchange Visitor System (SEVIS) record with another SEVP-certified institution in the U.S., they may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to Northeastern University. Transfer students must:
  1. Request to have their SEVIS record transferred out from their current institution to Northeastern University
  2. Apply for a Transfer I-20 from Northeastern University


Please see the [Requesting your Transfer-In I-20 page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/requesting-your-transfer-in-i-20-f-1/) for more information.
##  Who is a Change of Status student? 
If you are currently in the U.S. in a non-immigrant status (B-1/B-2*, F-1, F-2, H-1b or H-4) and would like to change to a different non-immigrant status (F-1, F-2, J-1 or J-2), you must apply for a Change of Status I-20. Once you’ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options:
  * **Option 1:** You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as  _Consular Processing._
  * **Option 2:** You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process.


*If you are in B-1 or B-2 status you are not eligible to study or enroll in classes until your change of status application has been approved.
Please note:you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status
> USCIS Review of Publicly Available Social Media
> The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may review publicly available social media content in connection with certain applications. This may include applications submitted by F-1 students for benefits such as OPT, STEM OPT Extension or change of status. These reviews are intended to support eligibility verification and national security screening. For more, visit [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism).
> Within their review, USCIS will also consider if the applicant has demonstrated “Anti-American” or “Antisemitic” activity. You can review OGS’ [USCIS Policy Changes page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/uscis-policy-changes/) for more information.
To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310.
TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS 
We don’t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can’t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS.
CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT) 
In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year. 
If you are a change of status student and have questions about CPT/OPT eligibility, please call OGS to schedule an appointment with an advisor by calling +1-617-373-2310.
##  What is a Change of Degree Level? 
If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a [Change of Degree Level e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/change-of-degree-level/) request to myOGS prior to starting the new program

##  Campus Changes Prior to Arrival in the U.S. 
Please note that the I-20 you receive from OGS is created specifically for the campus that you indicated you will be studying. To avoid any issues or delays with your F-1 visa application, OGS encourages students to commit to their campus before requesting their I-20. 
All campus changes must be approved by the admissions department prior to requesting an I-20.
  * **If you have already been issued an I-20** and have been approved to change campuses within the U.S., your I-20 will be cancelled, and you will be issued a new I-20 with a different SEVIS ID. If you have already paid the I-901 fee with your previous SEVIS record, you may request to [transfer the payment](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2017/06/students-sevp-now-accepts-online-i-901-sevis-fee-transfer-requests) to the new SEVIS record. 


  * **If your visa application has already been approved** and you wish to transfer to another Northeastern campus, your previous I-20 will be cancelled and we advise you to re-apply for the F-1 visa.


It may be possible to request a change of campus when you are a current student. Please speak to your Academic Advisor if you wish to pursue this option.
