## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Introduction to Rhetoric](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/social-sciences-humanities/english/#coursestext)
#### ENGL 1160
Introduces students to major concepts, traditions, and issues in rhetorical studies. Explores the range of ways that people persuade others to change their minds or take action; the relationship among language, truth, and knowledge; and the role of language in shaping identity and culture. Focuses on recognized thinkers from the Western tradition as well as writers that challenge the rhetorical canon. Emphasizes contemporary and interdisciplinary approaches to rhetoric interested in the entire range of rhetorical artifacts, with primary attention given to methods of critically investigating texts and their effects. 
  * ###  [Opening the (Queer) Archive](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/undergraduate/social-sciences-humanities/english/#coursestext)
#### ENGL 4400
Delve into rich, quirky, and campy queer archives! From ‘zines to buttons, photographs to high heels, this course invites you to sift through queer pasts as we consider how those pasts are compiled, sorted, and opened up for our use. This course counts towards the WGSS minor. 


### [Queer Digital Curation ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/social-sciences-humanities/english/#coursestext)
#### ENGL 7380
Developed at the intersection of theory and practice, this course will introduce students to queer theory in the context of digital curation. Digital curation refers to the selection, organization, preservation, and representation of digital resources; it is largely focused on efficiency, structure, and use. Queer theory, on the other hand, critically investigates cultural normativities related to sex, sexuality, and gender; it often values disruption, deconstruction, and play. A queer approach to digital curation, then, will allow us to unpack the invisible norms of digital environments as we think through the effects of digital tools, particularly those used for social justice purposes. There will be a hands-on unit of this course; however, prior knowledge of LGBTQ+ issues or the digital humanities is not expected––all students are welcome in this course.
