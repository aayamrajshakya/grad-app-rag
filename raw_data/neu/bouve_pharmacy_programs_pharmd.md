The school is affiliated with many world-class practice sites in metropolitan Boston and throughout the United States providing students with access to experienced clinicians and scholars.
## Student Groups
PharmD students are actively involved on campus and in the community. Our student groups provide the opportunity to build upon your education, enhance your experience, and get to know other students both within and outside the Pharmacy major.

  * National Community Pharmacists Association
  * Phi Lambda Sigma National Pharmacy Leadership Society


## Frequently
### What can I do with a PharmD?
Most people think of the role of a community pharmacist who works at a pharmacy, but there are many other career paths and opportunities for graduates. Other areas that pharmacists are employed in are hospitals, ambulatory care clinics, federal agencies, emergency departments, pharmaceutical companies, veterinary settings, legal industry or in public health.
### How do I apply to the PharmD?
Current High School Students: First time college applicants will just select “Pharmacy (PharmD)” as their major of interest on the Northeastern undergraduate application. There is not a separate application or supplement to be eligible for the PharmD major. Students will work with program faculty to move from the undergraduate into the graduate portion of the program.
Transfer students: Students can change majors within Northeastern to PharmD. Students from outside of Northeastern can apply to transfer into the 2nd pre-professional year or the first professional year of the program. Please reach out to [[email protected]](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bcded9dfd3d1d9ded3c9cad9fcd2d3cec8d4d9ddcfc8d9ced292d9d8c9) with any questions on this process.
### What types of co-op can I do?
Pharmacy students are required to complete practical hours in both an institutional and community pharmacy setting as part of the Introductory Pharmacy Practice Experiences (IPPEs) to earn the PharmD degree. Students may gain experience in hospitals, community settings, retail or specialty pharmacies. Northeastern students can be paid for their IPPEs as it is embedded into co-op learning.
### Can I study abroad?
Yes!! All students can have a global experience, regardless of their major. There are many options for students, including [Dialogues of Civilizations](https://geo.northeastern.edu/programs/dialogue-of-civilizations/), a short-term summer program that is a unique and popular choice for Northeastern students. Mobility is a key component of the Northeastern student experience, and opportunities are available at Northeastern’s global campuses.
