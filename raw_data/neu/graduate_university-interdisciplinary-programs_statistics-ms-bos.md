2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The field of statistics plays a critical role in the support of nearly every industry including technology; business, management, and finance; healthcare and pharmaceuticals; and more. The Master of Science in Statistics develops a comprehensive and flexible skill set that allows graduates to adapt to an ever-changing job market in various occupations and industries. In an era of increasing automation of Big Data, the value of the rigor of statistical thinking and analysis by individuals grows with the rise of automated Big Data analysis (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). This program in statistics is designed to provide learners with a solid foundation in applied, modern, and computational approaches to statistical analysis and exposure to the statistical thinking skills necessary to critically assess data and answer business and research questions across domains. Core courses integrate theory and application, enabling students to be ready for the job on day one. Upon application, each student selects an industry concentration (biostatistics, statistical machine learning, and statistical theory and modeling) to examine statistical theories and applied methodologies most relevant to specific career pathways. In this degree program, students are admitted to the college associated with their concentration, and their degree is awarded by that college. The concentrations are associated with the following colleges:
  * Biostatistics—Bouvé College of Health Sciences
  * Statistical machine learning—Khoury College of Computer Sciences
  * Statistical theory and modeling—College of Science


Students will follow all policies associated with their home college. Each student finishes the program with experiential courses such as a thesis, capstone, or consulting project, where they gain hands-on, project-based experience addressing business problems and presenting and communicating the findings and recommendations.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
