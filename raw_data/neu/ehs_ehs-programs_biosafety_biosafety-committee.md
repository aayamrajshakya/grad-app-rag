## Overview
We provide comprehensive biological safety and support services for research and teaching with biological materials to promote and protect the NU community and environment. 
We partner with the Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC), Principal Investigators, College and Department Safety Officers, and research staff to review and support biological research and implement preventative measures to effectively reduce or eliminate the risk of hazardous biological materials in research.
