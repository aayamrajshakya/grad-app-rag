#  Theodore C.Landsmark
Distinguished Professor of Public Policy and Urban Affairs; Director, Kitty and Michael Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy 
Ted Landsmark has been a civic planner, civil rights and equity advocate, higher education administrator, arts and culture researcher, and community-engaged social activist in Boston and nationally. He serves on the leadership committee of the Northeastern University Faculty Senate.
As Director of the Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy, Professor Landsmark oversees inter-disciplinary research on urban policy matters, including housing, gentrification, economic development, civic engagement, school design, comprehensive services, transportation, resilience, and public service. Dr. Landsmark teaches the Open Classroom on community engagement in policy planning and design, racial equity and civic justice, and Capstone courses. He has convened an annual conference on equitable policy engagement. His research and practice interests include diversity in environmental design and education, higher education administration, community-based economic development, historic preservation, resilience and sustainability, and African American artisanry.
As Mayor Walsh’s first appointment to the Boston Planning and Development Agency’s Board of Directors, Landsmark has brought to the board a wealth of expertise in architecture, urban design, civic leadership, architectural and construction law, and community advocacy. Since joining the board, the agency has rebranded, held hundreds of community meetings annually, planned and facilitated the development of over $50 billion in real estate including 35,000 housing units, ~30% of which have been income-restricted, and generated over $15 million in jobs training and affordable housing funds. During his seventeen-year tenure as president and CEO of the Boston Architectural College, Dr. Landsmark led the growth of the school from a design center into an internationally recognized, multi-disciplinary higher education institution. 
Ted Landsmark has served as academic vice president of the American College of the Building Arts in Charleston, South Carolina, and as a faculty member and administrator at the Massachusetts College of Art, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard University, and UMass Boston.
