## Innovative Curriculum - MS in Mechanical Engineering
At the MS level students may pursue a program preparing for advanced practice or for MS thesis research. All MS students with assistantships are required to complete a thesis. Other students may elect either the thesis or non-thesis option. All course work must have the approval of the academic advisor.

Materials Science
The MS in Mechanical Engineering has a Materials Science concentration. Materials science has been the key enabler in virtually all engineering breakthroughs that have occurred from early metal ages to the present nano age. In step with the scientific development and discovery of materials, members of the mechanical and industrial engineering faculty are involved in interdisciplinary research to further materials processing, synthesis, and design. Research areas are aligned with Northeastern University’s broad initiatives of sustainability, security, and health, as well as national initiatives in manufacturing and nanotechnology. Investigations in the areas of metals/alloys, polymers, biomaterials (including biomimetics), and composites incorporating nanoscale materials make use of experimental, theoretical, and computational techniques to tailor structure-processing-property relationships in materials for specific applications. Current areas of research include controlling synthesis and assembly processes to produce well-defined atomic structures; defect engineering; manipulating atomic/microstructures and the chemistry of materials to optimize properties for next-generation structural, electronic, and energy applications; solidification and deformation processing; and life-cycle assessments for nanocomposites/materials. Northeastern faculty and students are committed to creative thinking and engineering innovation to propel materials development to the forefront of scientific research.

Mechanics and Design
The MS in Mechanical Engineering has a Mechanics and Design concentration. Students will study the motion, deformation, and failure of solid materials in response to the action of direct forces and external fields. The students will also get a chance to conduct research with faculty and observe how these studies will lead to key engineering innovations and designs. Using complementary analytical, computational, experimental, and design tools, the M&D faculty members conduct research in the design and analysis of engineered functional materials/structures, in mechanics of adhesion and contact, and in biomechanics and mechanobiology. For example, in our biomechanics research, we strive to close the gap between function, form, and disease in the bone by using experimental and computational techniques; also, we explore the mechanics of lipid-based drug delivery vesicles. At the small length scales, we are creating a new understanding of nanomechanics, contact mechanics, tribology, MEMS, and the application of nanomaterials for energy storage systems. Our research and teaching together are designed to prepare students to understand and exploit mechanics to enable their future engineering innovations.

Mechatronics
The MS in Mechanical Engineering has a Mechatronics concentration. The term mechatronics is a combination of the words mechanics and electronics. Mechatronics is a multidisciplinary approach to product design and development, merging the principles of electrical, mechanical, computer, material, chemical, and industrial engineering. The mechatronics and systems research cluster in the MIE department is concerned with systems that are typically composed of traditional mechanical and electrical components but are rendered “intelligent” by the incorporation of sensors, actuators, and computer control systems. Our primary focus in mechatronics and systems is on intelligent and integrated systems and machines along with their practical applications ranging from manufacturing systems and robotic platforms to biological systems. Our research and teaching together are designed to prepare students to understand and exploit mechatronics to enable their future engineering innovations.

Thermofluids
The MS in Mechanical Engineering has a Thermofluids concentration. Some of the representative research areas under this concentration may include thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, kinetic theory of gases, and thermophoresis of aerosols; microscale heat transfer phenomena and its effects on laser beam propagation; fundamentals of combustion such as burning speed and onset of auto-ignition measurement and flame stability analysis; development of chemistry reduction such as rate-controlled constrained-equilibrium method; formation and control of combustion-generated pollutants and greenhouse gases; chemistry, transport, and abatement of air pollution; alternative energy sources; combustion-based synthesis of materials; fire propagation, containment, and extinction; nonequilibrium thermodynamics; energy and gas turbine cooling technology; turbine blade cooling; and energy-related and calorimeter studies related to pharmaceutical developments. Our research and teaching together seek to prepare students to understand and exploit thermofluids to enable their future engineering innovations.

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a Co-op Program for graduate students. Through this program students gain up to eight months of professional experience employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive advantage after graduation.
