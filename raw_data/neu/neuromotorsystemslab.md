Our lab’s research aims to understand how the brain controls movement, learns new movements, and re-learns movement capabilities that have been lost to injury or disease.
### Telerobotics
What if we give physical therapists more control over robotic rehabilitation systems?
### Virtual Patients
What can we learn by manipulating the locomotion of a model, instead of a real patient?
### Assistive Technology
How can we make assistive technology be… less assistive?
