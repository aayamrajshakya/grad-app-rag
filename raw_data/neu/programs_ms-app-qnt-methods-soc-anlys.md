Learning objectives
The 21st century economy will increasingly demand a workforce capable of collecting, processing, analyzing, and interpreting large-scale data on human attributes, personal preferences, social attributes, and political behavior. In response, this program provides students with rigorous training in quantitative research and social science methods to address important questions of social inquiry.
Emphasizing public dissemination of findings, the program prepares students to inform decision-makers in the private and public sectors, and the broader community. These skills prepare graduates to pursue analytical or research careers in corporations, non-profits, and public services, or to continue their education.
Co-op opportunities
Students in this program may take advantage of various co-op opportunities—positions such as policy analysts, network scientists, econometricians, and crime analysts. These co-op opportunities provide students with a professional environment to integrate quantitative skills and social analysis. The learning opportunities in professional settings (private sector, government, or non-profit sector) reinforce the development of advanced quantitative skills and their applied nature to contemporary social issues.
