#  Engineering Leadership 
The Gordon Engineering Leadership program is a transformational graduate curriculum offered by the [Gordon Institute for Engineering Leadership](https://gordon.northeastern.edu/) in partnership with the College of Engineering at Northeastern University. Each year, a select number of highly qualified engineering professionals pursue the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program as part of a Master of Science degree in any engineering discipline or as a standalone Certificate in Engineering Leadership. Graduates of the program, known as Gordon Fellows, emerge with the capabilities and confidence to lead the engineering breakthroughs of tomorrow.

### Graduate Student Benefits
Gordon Fellows will demonstrate an exceptional ability to lead engineering teams by providing purpose, direction, and motivation to influence others to achieve their collective goals. 
Gordon Fellows acquire these essential capabilities through a concentrated curriculum of advanced leadership and technical coursework, one-on-one mentoring, and a market-worthy project based on the organization’s strategic needs. 
At the end of the program, Gordon Fellows emerge with the confidence, vision, and technical dexterity to drive positive change within their organizations.
### Gordon Undergraduate Outreach
The Gordon Institute does not offer any undergraduate programs for academic credit; however, undergraduate students may apply to the master’s program, leadership development workshop sessions, and as a PlusOne student complete the engineering leadership certificate coursework as part of their master’s program.
