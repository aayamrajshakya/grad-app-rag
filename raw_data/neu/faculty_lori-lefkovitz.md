  * ###  [Jewish Religion and Culture](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### JWSS/PHIL 1285
Explores the basic features of Judaism in the ancient, rabbinic, and modern periods. Employs a historical critical approach to the formative texts and their interpreters. Analyzes Jewish practices within specific historical contexts and discusses the ways in which practices relate to the texts and history of Judaism. Examines the rich varieties of Jewish cultural expressions. 
  * ###  [Modern and Contemporary Jewish Literature](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL/JWSS 3685
Surveys Jewish literature from the late modern (1880–1948) and contemporary (1948–present) periods. Considers themes of immigration and cross-cultural influences and issues of religious, ethnic, and gender identity. Emphasizes American and European literatures to begin to define an international Jewish literary canon, including Yiddish poets and playwrights, Russian Jewish writers, and modern writers. 


### [Bedrooms and Battlefields: Hebrew Bible and the Origins of Sex, Gender, and Ethnicity ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL/JWSS/WMNS 3678
Considers stories from Hebrew Scripture in English translation, beginning with the Garden of Eden through the Book of Ruth, asking how these foundational narratives establish the categories that have come to define our humanity. Analyzes how the Bible’s patterns of representation construct sexual and ethnic identities and naturalize ideas about such social institutions as “the family.”
