2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Globalization has created a borderless economy with a host of new opportunities and challenges for those engaged in commerce and economic development. While global markets offer exciting growth prospects, navigating the world stage requires in-depth knowledge of the financial, regulatory, and economic environments and institutions that affect the global economy and international trade. To meet the need for both insight and skills development, Northeastern University’s College of Professional Studies—in collaboration with Northeastern University’s College of Social Sciences and Humanities—offers the online Master of Science in Commerce and Economic Development.
This graduate-level program integrates economics, leadership, institutional organization, technology, and public policy into a unique and focused educational experience designed to help guide and advance a rewarding career in the private or public sectors.
