2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Information Systems—Bridge addresses the needs of the digital revolution by preparing students with non–STEM, nontechnical bachelor’s degrees to become information systems professionals. MSIS—Bridge students are the link between business users and technologists. As industries launch into a digitized future, professionals with a clear understanding of how technology can be used to address significant societal challenges are in demand. The MSIS—Bridge program closes the gaps between business management, software engineering, and information technology to help students solve complex real-world issues in business and society. It also upskills and reskills to help individuals or businesses identify organizational skills gaps and create a tactical training plan to fill them with new skills and knowledge. Through specially created and selected core courses, students gain the engineering foundation needed to excel in the classroom and in the IT sector.
