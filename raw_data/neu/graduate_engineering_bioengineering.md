The Department of Bioengineering is driven by the conviction that the interface of engineering and medicine will be one of the great intellectual adventures of the 21st century. To prepare students for this adventure, the department strives to create an atmosphere of innovation and creativity that fosters excellence in instruction and research and provides a foundation for programs that drive forward the cutting edge of knowledge while establishing translational collaborations with clinical and industrial researchers. 
Bioengineering is built on the recognition that engineering of biological systems, or tools that interface with living systems, requires a multidisciplinary approach considering mechanical, electrical, chemical, and materials processes. Students with backgrounds from biochemistry to computer science, and many fields in between, are attracted to bioengineering as a field with the potential to make a great impact on human health. The MS and PhD programs are designed to integrate students with very different backgrounds and provide them with the coursework and research experience that will take advantage of and build on their unique experiences. 
Recognizing the breadth of disciplines that contribute to bioengineering, the MS program allows students to choose a concentration to develop deep expertise in an area of particular interest, selecting from biomechanics and mechanobiology; biomedical devices and bioimaging; molecular, cell, and tissue engineering; or systems, synthetic, and computational bioengineering. The MS program encourages individual research through an optional one-semester master's project or a master's project followed by a master's thesis. 
The PhD program spans research areas for which the department has particular strengths. The PhD program in Boston specializes in biomechanics and mechanobiology; biomedical devices and bioimaging; molecular, cell, and tissue engineering; and systems, synthetic, and computational bioengineering. The PhD program at the Roux Institute in Portland specializes in artificial intelligence in translational healthcare. PhD coursework is designed to strengthen student backgrounds in the areas most relevant to their interests.
## Mission of the Department

Introduces basic concepts from linear algebra, ordinary and partial differential equations, transforms, function approximation, probability, statistics, and numerical computation, illustrated by applications in biology and medicine. 
  

BIOE 6962. Elective. (1-4 Hours)
Offers elective credit for courses taken at other academic institutions. May be repeated without limit. 
  

BIOE 7000. Principles of Bioengineering. (4 Hours)
Designed to introduce new graduate bioengineering students to the fundamentals of bioengineering research topics and methodology. Includes outside speakers to discuss general topics in bioengineering. Examples of course topics include the medical device qualification and regulatory environment, tissue engineering, cell engineering, mechanobiology, drug delivery, bioimaging, neuromotor control, effective design of experiments, writing research proposals for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and how to evaluate and write a peer-reviewed journal article, etc. Expects students to read, critically evaluate, and present the research in a bioengineering journal article. Students are then expected to extend their article into a hypothesis-driven proposal in NIH format with an oral defense of the proposal. 
  

BIOE 7210. A Data Science Toolkit for Human Neuroscience Research. (4 Hours)
Introduces fundamental programming, statistics, and machine learning methods that underlie modern human neuroscience research. Emphasizes understanding how linear models form the building blocks for a wide range of commonly used methods, as well as application of these methods through standard scientific computing libraries. With hands-on learning, students use R and Python to work through projects tailored to real-world neuroimaging applications (e.g., fMRI, EEG). Applies basic statistical and machine learning analysis procedures for human neuroscience research with R and Python to understand fundamental considerations underlying their application. 
  

BIOE 7374. Special Topics in Bioengineering. (4 Hours)
Offers topics of current interest in bioengineering. May be repeated up to nine times. 
  

BIOE 7390. Seminar. (0 Hours)
Presents topics of an advanced nature by faculty, outside speakers, and students in the graduate program. May be repeated without limit. 
  

BIOE 7391. Student Seminar. (0 Hours)
Offers students an opportunity to practice clear and concise oral communication of research to an audience of people with a variety of skills and differing expertise. This is an essential skill for anyone seeking a career in scientific research and beyond. It differs from communicating research to a group meeting or a conference presentation, which is comprised of audiences of fellow specialists who are already familiar with the field and its specialized terminology. Students instead present to a diverse, interdisciplinary group of peers (i.e., the Department of Bioengineering and other members of the Northeastern community). Maybe be repeated once.
