Program overview 
##  Explore the universe through physics 
The physics department offers Master of Science degrees with several options. The standard physics MS can be obtained by taking a specified set of courses without an MS thesis. Alternatively, an MS thesis may substitute for 8 credit hours of coursework. Both of these options may be pursued either full time or part time.
Upon completion of the MS in Physics degree, you should be able to apply graduate-level knowledge and solve problems in the areas of electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics, statistical mechanics, and advanced mathematical methods.
