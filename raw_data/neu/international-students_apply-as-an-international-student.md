## International application requirements
First, visit our [How To Apply](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/admissions-aid/how-to-apply/) page for a list of application requirements applicable to all prospective graduate students. Non-U.S. citizens and non-U.S. permanent residents may need to submit additional documents, including those listed below.
[ See requirements for all applicants](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/admissions-aid/how-to-apply/)
### Official transcripts and Foreign Credential Evaluation
Foreign Credential Evaluation (FCE) is a required assessment of all transcripts and documents from non-U.S. accredited post-secondary education institutions. In addition to your official transcripts, you may need to obtain additional documents per the [FCE requirements](https://northeastern.my.site.com/GraduateAdmissionsFAQ/s/article/What-documents-are-required-for-a-credential-evaluation) for the country where you completed your academic study.
### I-20 request form
All students who will be studying with an F-1 visa need an I-20 form in order to move forward with the visa process. You can complete an I-20 request form and submit a copy of your passport or permanent residency card after being admitted into your desired program.
### Proof of English proficiency
Most programs require that international students show proof of English proficiency, which may be met by submitting official TOEFL, IELTS, PTE, or Duolingo exam scores with your application. Be sure to check your program’s requirements before taking an exam, as preferred minimum scores and exams accepted vary by college.
Students may be exempt from the requirement if they submit documentation proving they received a bachelor’s or master’s degree from a college or university in which English was the only language of instruction. To learn more about English proficiency exam requirement waivers, please [contact the college admissions](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/connect-with-us/college-contact-information/) office directly.
