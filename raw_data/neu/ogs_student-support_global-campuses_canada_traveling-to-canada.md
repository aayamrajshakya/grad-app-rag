####  [ What are the late arrival and deferral policies? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/traveling-to-canada/#collapse-1)

Once your study permit is issued, you must study. You cannot remain in Canada without studying as this will impact your study permit validity and your PGWP eligibility. Do not travel to Canada unless you are ready and able to study. Don’t arrive more than 2 months before program start date- you are not authorized to work before program start date.​
Our academic terms are very short and Master’s level studies are intense. Arriving late when classes have already started could have a major impact on your academic performance, as you will be adjusting to being in a new country, learning how to navigate public transportation, find somewhere to live, etc. There are so many tasks to take care of when you first arrive, and arrival deadlines are also there to ensure that students can get a positive start to their journey in Canada.

If your study permit is approved too late for you to arrive in time to start your program by your Program Start Date, you will need to request to defer your program start to the next intake.

When you travel to Canada, you should also ensure you take your old POA, new POA, and new decision letter.
