Career outlook 
Given the landmark CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, a significant share of new chip manufacturing capacity and R&D is expected to be located in the U.S. The Semiconductor Industry Association projects that the semiconductor industry’s workforce will grow by nearly 115,000 by 2030 to approximately 460,000 jobs by the end of the decade, representing 33% growth. An estimated 80% of new technical risk going unfilled at current degree completion rates. Of the unfilled jobs, 35% will be engineers or computer scientists with four-year degrees, and 26% will be engineers at the master’s or PhD level.

“The United States currently makes about 10% of all chips and aspires to 30% share by 2030… and we will need more people in more locations to make a trillion dollars’ worth of chips.”—Deloitte, The Global Semiconductor Talent Shortage
“Research into new materials (such as silicon carbide and gallium nitride), advanced packaging, specialized ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) applications, and the increased importance of embedded software have changed the talent profile for semiconductor companies.”—McKinsey, Strategies To Lead in the Semiconductor World
