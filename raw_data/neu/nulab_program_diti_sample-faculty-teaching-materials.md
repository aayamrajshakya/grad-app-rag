#  Digital IntegrationTeaching Initiative
A presentation on [Our Marathon](https://marathon.library.northeastern.edu/) for an Advanced Writing in the Disciplines course
To support educators interested in using digital and computational methods in their teaching, the [Digital Integration Teaching Initiative](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/) (DITI) has published a collection of sample teaching materials that instructors can modify or take inspiration from. Submitted by faculty partners, these materials include syllabi, assignments, rubrics, and other course materials that have involved [tools or topics taught by the DITI](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/modules/samples/). 
These materials are published under a Creative Commons license, [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), which requires that any reused materials be credited to the author and that all reuse be noncommercial. This licensing does allow these materials to be adapted for other teaching contexts. Copyright for all materials is retained by their creators. 
The DITI team hopes to expand these resources in the future. If you have an assignment, syllabus, or activity to share, please email nulab.info@gmail.com.
