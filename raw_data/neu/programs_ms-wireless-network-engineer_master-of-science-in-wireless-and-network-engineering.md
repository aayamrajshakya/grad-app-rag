Career outlook 
Cisco projects that by 2023, 66% of the global population will be internet users, and the number of devices connected to the internet will be more than three times the global population. An estimated 70% of the global population will have mobile connectivity-10% through 5G devices. In the coming years, 5G and 6G systems will affect every part of the U.S. economy, creating 4.6 million jobs by 2034. Qualified applicants will be in high demand for jobs across educational institutions, federal agencies, and national research labs. Graduates of the MS in Wireless and Network Engineering will come to these careers with skills ranging from hardware design and electromagnetic characterization to communication techniques and networking protocols for 5G, 6G, and beyond.
Program experience 
Northeastern’s Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things maintains strong relationships with leading companies in the wireless, defense, computing, and manufacturing fields that sponsor its research-creating unique co-op and research opportunities for students. Students conduct research and experiential projects at the Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things, a leading center for next-generation wireless and wired communication networks-with emphasis on 6G wireless systems, machine learning applications for network orchestration and management, and overall large-scale experimental research.
Students have the use of test beds such as Colosseum, the world’s largest wireless RF emulation platform, as well as X-Mili and TeraNova, the largest millimeter-wave and terahertz networking platforms in the nation. Students are also given exclusive access to on-campus FCC-designated Spectrum Innovation Zones-among only a few such zones in the nation. Northeastern is also one of only a handful of universities that are part of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the United Nations’ specialized agency for information and communication technologies.
Northeastern is an R1 research institution ranked No. 1 in internships/co-ops by U.S. News & World Report
