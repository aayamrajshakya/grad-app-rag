#  Students Studying in The United States 
##  Secondary Approver Routing Process 
1  Selecting the College 
By using the Navigate this Page tab on the right, the student will select their designated college from the drop down menu.
2  Selecting the Secondary Approver 
Select the secondary approver from the list under the student’s designated college.
3  Adding Secondary Approver to E-form 
Copy the email for the secondary approver from the website and paste it into the box titled “Approver Email” on the CPT Request. See example below
4  Submitting CPT Request 
Once the secondary approver has been added student can submit the e-form for review. The secondary approver (academic advisor, co-op coordinator, or SEVIS contact) who receives the application will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically. If approved, the secondary approver will submit the request to OGS. If the secondary approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision.
