# International Students
Northeastern University is home to one of the largest international student communities in the United States and provides international students with resources, support, and guidance as they chart their academic journey. Review the information on this page to understand what financial resources are available.
### Admission Process
The admission application process varies based on the program or college you are choosing to apply to.
Undergraduate admission to Northeastern is need-aware for all international students, which means the Admissions Committee will consider your ability to cover your Northeastern educational costs when your admissions decision is being made.
All international students must submit the Declaration and Certification of Finances (DCF) at the time of application for admission to illustrate and document sufficient financial support that meets Northeastern’s estimated costs (including both tuition and living expenses) for one year. International students can access the DCF via their [Application Status Check](https://www.northeastern.edu/admissions/application-information/application-status-check/). Please note, when considering the cost of attending Northeastern, it is important to consider the full program cost, in addition to estimated expenses for one year.
Further instructions are available on the [Undergraduate Admissions website](https://www.northeastern.edu/admissions/application-information/international-student-admissions/).
The application process varies based on the program or college you are choosing to apply to.
Learn more about applying as an international student in [Graduate Programs](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/admissions-information/how-to-apply/applying-as-an-international-student/) or the [College of Professional Studies](https://cps.northeastern.edu/admissions/international).
### Need-Based Financial Aid and Merit Scholarships
Although only U.S. citizens or eligible noncitizens are eligible for federal or university-provided need-based financial aid, international students may qualify for merit-based scholarships.
Incoming, first-year international students are automatically considered for merit-based scholarships through their application for undergraduate admission. Available scholarship opportunities include:
#### International Scholars Award
Competitive, merit-based scholarship award. Awards range up to $28,000 annually but do not cover the total cost of attendance.
#### RaiseMe
Northeastern has partnered with [RaiseMe](https://www.raise.me/join/northeastern) to offer U.S. high school students the opportunity to earn microscholarships that recognize their academic achievements and outstanding accomplishments. Students can earn up to $20,000 in microscholarships each year, which will be incorporated in their Northeastern University financial aid award.
Eligibility for microscholarships is determined at the time of admission to Northeastern University. You must complete and submit your RaiseMe portfolio by our earning deadline of November 1
#### Outside Scholarships
Students may be eligible for a variety of outside scholarships independent of Northeastern University and the federal/state aid process. A number of organizations, both within the U.S. and globally, have funds available for students who meet their criteria. Students are encouraged to pursue outside scholarship opportunities to help with the cost of their education.
Resources for outside scholarships include:
  * [Funding for U.S. Study (IIE)](https://www.fundingusstudy.org/)
  * [International Scholarships & Financial Aid (IEFA)](https://www.iefa.org/)
  * [International Student & Study Abroad Scholarship Search](https://www.internationalstudent.com/scholarships/)
  * [International Scholarship Search](https://www.internationalscholarships.com/)


Students in Graduate Programs as well as the College of Professional Studies, both bachelor’s completion and master’s degrees, are considered for merit-based scholarships through their application for admission. Additionally, graduate students may be considered for scholarship opportunities through the department or college they are applying to.
If you have questions regarding merit-based scholarships for [Graduate Programs](https://www.northeastern.edu/graduate/) and the [College of Professional Studies](https://cps.northeastern.edu/tuition-financial-aid/scholarships), please contact the department, college, or school to which you are applying to or are currently enrolled.
International students with proper authorization are permitted to work on campus during their program of study. Learn more about employment options on the [F-1](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/f1-on-campus-employment/) and [J-1](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/j1-on-campus-employment/) visas.
### Estimated Cost of Attendance
[View a complete list of tuition and fee rates](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/tuition-and-fees/). All tuition and fees are subject to revision by Northeastern University’s Board of Trustees.
Please note, indirect expenses, including books, personal expenses, transportation, and living allowance, are not charged directly by the university. However, they are part of your total cost of attendance and important when considering the cost of attending Northeastern University. Additionally, the estimated figures below are for one academic year only, and will vary depending on course load, living accommodations, and personal expenses. When considering the cost of attending Northeastern, it is important to consider the full program cost.
Students are entitled to borrow up to their cost of attendance, less any award merit-based or outside scholarships. As such, the figures reflected below may vary from the minimum dollar amount required to receive an I-20. For additional information regarding the I-20, including an estimate of expenses for the I-20, please visit the [Office of Global Services website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/applying-for-your-initial-i-20/).
### Financial Planning Considerations
Learn more about financing options, billing statements, and how you can monitor your student account.
Billing statements are generated approximately four to six weeks prior to the beginning of the semester and posted to the Stude Hub. An email will be sent to your Northeastern email account once your billing statement is available.
Full payment of tuition, residence hall fees, and other related charges are due prior to the start of the term, as specified by the due date on the original billing statement. A past-due balance may result in the prevention of registration or grade release assessment of late fees and/or financial holds applied to your account. Balances that are over 90 days past the original due date for the term may be sent to [Heartland ECSI](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/payment-partners/). Should a balance due remain, your account may be sent to a collection agency.
Please note: Payments will be accepted for billed charges only. The university is not able to process payments for more than the balance due on your account.
For additional information regarding the billing process, please visit our [Billing FAQ](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/billing-faq/).
Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in Direct Deposit at Northeastern University. Enrollment in Direct Deposit can be completed electronically, through the Student Hub, and has several benefits for students.
For additional information about Direct Deposit and how to enroll, please visit our [Direct Deposit FAQ](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/direct-deposit/).
Massachusetts law requires that every student in a Massachusetts institution of higher learning participate in a student health insurance plan that meets or exceeds state minimum requirements. NUSHP, the university’s student health plan, is administered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Massachusetts and exceeds the minimum required by the state.
For additional information, please email [[email protected]](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#2f617a7c677f6f41405d5b474a4e5c5b4a5d41014a4b5a) or visit the [NUSHP website](https://studenthealthplan.northeastern.edu/).
In those situations where the tuition is paid directly to the university by a third party, the student must provide the Office of Student Accounts with a purchase order or a written statement of intent to pay by the third party no later than the end of the first week of classes. If there are stipulations associated with the payment agreement, such as a minimum grade level, then the student must either pay the university directly or enroll in one of the payment options.
Northeastern University offers [monthly payment plans](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/financing-options/), administered through Flywire. The monthly payment plan allows you to divide your educational costs into smaller installments.
[Flywire](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/payment-methods/) allows students and their families a safe, cost-effective, and convenient method of making international wire payments to the university in foreign currencies. Advantages of using Flywire include tracking your payment from start to finish, the ability to pay from any country and any bank, as well as the best rate guarantee on foreign exchange rates.
International students and their families may be eligible to borrow from private lenders with a credit-worthy U.S. co-signer. When considering supplemental loan options, you should compare the benefits and costs of several lenders before you apply to find the one that best meets your needs.
[Learn more about loan options including tips for researching private loans.](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/financing-options/)
Please note that the Office of Student Financial Services is unable to provide individual tax advice. If you have questions regarding the tax filing process, required forms, or a unique tax filing circumstance, please speak to a tax professional. Additional guidance for international students is available on the [Office of Global Services website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/tax-information/).
IRS Form 1098-T
By law, Northeastern University cannot produce a 1098-T form for a student without a valid Social Security number (SSN) or Tax Identification Number (TIN) on file. To update your SSN or TIN, please complete the Social Security Update form through the Office of the Registrar.
Once you have submitted this form and your SSN/TIN has been updated, please submit your 1098-T request through the [SFS Service Portal](https://northeastern.service-now.com/sfs) under ‘Student Accounts Requests’.
Additional information regarding 1098-T forms is available [here](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/1098-t/).
