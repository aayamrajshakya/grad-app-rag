##  What is a Study Permit? 
A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada. This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit. See [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html) for more information about the conditions under a study permit.
It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada.
If you are from a country that requires an entry visa (TRV) OR an eTA, this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit – you do not make a separate application for a travel visa. On approval, you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada.
#### When to Apply
The Study Permit application process can be lengthy. It is very important you apply for the permit as soon as you receive the Provincial Attestation Letter and Proof of Acceptance letter. We recommend applying a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date. Be sure to check with IRCC to determine the estimated processing time based on your country of application.
#### Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) and Proof of Acceptance (POA) Letter
You will need your PAL and a POA (also called Letter of Acceptance) to submit with your Study Permit application. The PAL and POA will be available to download on your application portal, once you are eligible for a PAL and you have paid the required deposit by the deadline.
Please note that OGS Canada does not issue PALs or POAs
#### Payments
For payment information, please see the [Student Financial Services webpage on Billing](https://sac.northeastern.edu/billing/).
##  Apply for your Study Permit 
Students may [apply for their Study Permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada.html) via an online application portal or via paper application. You also have the option of using the services of an authorized third party application collection service, called a [Visa Application Centre (VAC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/offices/find-visa-application-centre.html). If you are able, apply using the online application portal, as generally, online applications are processed more quickly than paper applications. Estimated processing times per country are available on the IRCC site.
All the information you need for the Study Permit application process is available on the IRCC website. This process is not managed by Northeastern University and we do not have additional insight into processing times or delays.
If you choose to use the services of an immigration advisor or lawyer to assist you with your application, please be certain to choose someone who is legally permitted to represent you to IRCC. To determine if a person is an authorized representative, please read the guidelines [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigration-citizenship-representative/choose/authorized.html). Additionally, check the CICC webpage on [top tips to prevent immigration fraud](https://college-ic.ca/protecting-the-public/fraud-prevention/top-tips).

### Provincial Attestation Letter
Starting in 2024, the Government of Canada introduced the Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL), a new requirement for international students applying for a study permit to begin studies in Canada. For more details, visit the [Government of Canada website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/get-documents/provincial-attestation-letter.html). All international students applying for a program at a Northeastern University Canadian campus will need to have a PAL from Northeastern to apply for their study permit.
You can find detailed information [here](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/poa-and-deposit-process/).
#### Study Permit Application Support
To support your study permit application, the Office of Global Services (OGS) is hosting virtual preparation sessions. It is highly recommended that students attend one of the many sessions prior to submitting your study permit application. For more information attending a study permit information session, please visit the[ OGS Canada Information Sessions webpage](https://connect.northeastern.edu/portal/ogs_canada_info_session?utm_medium=email&utm_source=slate&utm_campaign=em-yld-evg-int-grad-can-all-def-emb-2025_01_03-ogs_webinar_jan_rem_nr&_gl=1*1gbs1rt*_gcl_au*MTk3MTY4MDcyOC4xNzMzNzUzMzI5).
FYI: Program End Date/Completion Date
You will need to use the estimated amount of time shown on your POA in the Length of Program section to provide an estimate of your Completion Date. For example, if your POA states:
Completion Date: N/K  
Or minimum 20 months of full-time studies
Then your Completion Date should be estimated as 20 months after your Program Start Date. We cannot provide students with a specific dateYou will be able to apply for Study Permit Extension if you ended up needing more time to complete the program.
##  After Applying for a Study Permit
