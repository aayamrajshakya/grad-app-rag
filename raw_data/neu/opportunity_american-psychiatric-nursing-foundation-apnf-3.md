The American Psychiatric Nurses Association Research Grants program provides funding to enhance scientific contributions that advance the knowledge and practice of psychiatric-mental health nursing. APNA is accepting proposals in two categories:
  * Research studies to generate new knowledge to advance psychiatric mental health nursing
  * Evidence-based practice (EBP) change or quality improvement (QI) projects to apply evidence to practice


Duration
Grant Recipients will be notified in late July with funding to commence in August.
  * For grants $5,000 and above
    * 25% of the award will be sent in the initial payment (August 2024). An additional 50% will be dispensed at 6 months (January 2025) after receipt of a progress report including expenditures to date. The final 25% of the award will be sent after submission of the final report with full budget reconciliation (August 2025).
  * For grants below $5,000
    * 50% of the award will be sent in the initial payment (August 2024). The remaining 50% of the award will be sent after submission of the final report with full budget reconciliation (August 2025).
  * A change in the disbursement schedule can be requested in writing; changes must be justified and will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
  * Release of funds will be contingent upon required itemized budget reconciliation. If expenditure reports are not received in a timely fashion, funding is not guaranteed.


Funding
