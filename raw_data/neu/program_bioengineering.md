The PhD in Bioengineering is interdisciplinary by nature and reflects the department’s significant strengths across four areas of bioengineering research: biomechanics and mechanobiology; biomedical devices and bioimaging; molecular, cell, and tissue engineering; and systems, synthetic, and computational bioengineering.
Students accepted to the program will work with and learn from our outstanding faculty who are leaders in their field. Students complete a rigorous foundational curriculum in bioengineering science and mathematics, complemented by an immersion into individualized coursework tailored to their area of interest.
Students can pursue the program either at our Boston, Massachusetts campus or at our Portland, Maine campus. Situated in the vibrant heart of the city, our Boston campus is strategically positioned within the biotechnology hub of the Greater Boston area, adjacent to Cambridge start-ups and the Longwood Medical Area. Nestled within the Roux Institute, our Portland, Maine campus boasts a sweeping view of Casco Bay. The Roux Institute fosters a dynamic entrepreneurial culture with many programs tailored for start-up founders and a dedicated emphasis on AI and technology-driven innovations.
