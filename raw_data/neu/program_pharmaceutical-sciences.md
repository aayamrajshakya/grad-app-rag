Students studying pharmaceutical sciences will be thoroughly exposed to the fundamentals of physical pharmacy and pharmaceutics and trained in several specialized areas, including:
  * Novel drug delivery systems
  * Nanomedical technologies
  * Biopharmaceutics and pharmacokinetics


With exposure to these facets of the pharmaceutical sciences, successful graduates are poised to understand and assimilate the field of modern pharmaceutics. A PhD degree in pharmaceutics is a research-focused degree. While coursework plays an important role, students become active participants in the science of pharmaceutics in the laboratory. Faculty research in pharmaceutical sciences covers a broad range of scientific interests, including pharmacokinetic toxicodynamics of anticancer agents; use of novel biomaterials and synthetic polymeric systems in designing small-molecule drug delivery systems for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids; passive and active targeting of therapeutic agents for cancer and cardiovascular diseases; novel delivery systems for immunostimulating purposes; and mathematical modeling of endogenous compounds.

The interdisciplinary option is intended to meet the needs of students interested in combining courses and skills from two areas of specialization. At least one of the specialization areas must come from within the college. The second area may come from a department in another college at Northeastern University, such as biology, chemistry, or engineering. Students electing the interdisciplinary option must fulfill the same requirements as all other PhD candidates.
