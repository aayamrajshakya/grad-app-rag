# Fee Descriptions
All fees listed below are mandatory except for the Northeastern University Student Health Plan (NUSHP) fee. Students may waive the NUSHP fee through their Student Hub if they have comparable health plan coverage (please see below for details).
### Application Fees 
For first-year undergraduate day applicants, a nonrefundable fee must accompany an application for admission. For more information, see  _[Application Information for First-Year Applicants](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fadmissions.northeastern.edu%2Fapplication-information%2Ffirst-year-applicants%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cs.mccord%40northeastern.edu%7C1c644ee4d5014eb4668208ddbfcf91d9%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638877620411161960%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=KKuPmin687NVK2PCIJuPWcZu70d3ISbODx42P5GQxr0%3D&reserved=0)_.
For all other programs, application fees may vary. Please consult your program’s admissions website for more information.
### Campus Recreation Fee
This fee is assessed during terms a student is in classes to support and maintain current facilities and the future construction of athletic fields and facilities. In addition, students have the option to gain admission to home athletic events, use the Marino Fitness Center, the SquashBusters athletic facility, and the Cabot Gym (fitness and pool).
### Enrollment Deposits 
All admitted students must pay a non-refundable deposit to reserve a place at Northeastern. This secures your enrollment and initiates transition activities. Certain programs, such as N.U.in, may require multiple deposits. If you are an international student, your enrollment deposit includes the international student fee.
Undergraduate day students pay their enrollment deposit through Application Status Check.
For more information, please consult your program’s admissions website.
### Husky Card (Photo-Identification) 
The Husky Card is the official identification card at Northeastern University. Students must have a valid Husky Card to use at most university facilities. Along with identification, the Husky Card is also used for building/residence hall access, parking, printing, vending, dining services, library book check-out, discounts and more. Students who need to obtain a replacement Husky Card will be charged a replacement fee. For more information, including the cost of a replacement card, visit _[the Husky Card Services website.](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhuskycard.northeastern.edu%2Freport-a-lost-stolen-card%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cs.mccord%40northeastern.edu%7C1c644ee4d5014eb4668208ddbfcf91d9%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638877620411176675%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=F7FNALsD3cXEPvm2wF2C%2B2%2Bmvu%2F1XHd5I00YlpGQzVA%3D&reserved=0)_

### International Student Fee
International students are assessed this fee their first term, or upon admission to the university. If a student completes their program and enters a new educational level the student would be assessed the fee the first term of their new educational level.
### Lab/Studio Fee
Beginning Fall 2025, a fee will be charged for each lab and studio course for undergraduate students on the Boston and Oakland campuses. This fee will appear as a separate line item on the student’s account and tuition bill. Because laboratory and studio courses require specialized staffing, equipment, materials, and supplies that have significantly increased in cost, this fee will help Northeastern University maintain high-quality learning experiences by ensuring we can provide:
  * Up-to-date scientific and studio equipment
  * Consumable materials and chemicals
  * Safety equipment and protective gear
  * Maintenance and calibration of sensitive laboratory and studio instruments


### Northeastern University Health Plan
Massachusetts law requires every eligible student enrolled in an institution of higher learning to participate in a Student Health Plan or in a health benefit plan with comparable coverage every academic year. Students can waive this fee if they have comparable coverage by completing the Health Plan Waiver prior to the communicated deadline.

### Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF)
What is the STUDENT TUITION RECOVERY FUND (STRF) Fee? The State of California created the Student Tuition Recovery Fund (STRF) to relieve or mitigate economic losses suffered by students in educational programs who are California residents or are enrolled in a residency program attending certain schools regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary and Vocational Education. Amount of STRF Assessment: Each qualifying institution shall collect an assessment of two dollars and fifty cents ($2.50) per one thousand dollars ($1,000). This fee may change depending on the BPPE fund balance. Note: This fee is mandatory and cannot be waived.
