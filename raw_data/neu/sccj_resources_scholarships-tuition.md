### Financial Aid
Students seeking financial aid can find more information on the [Graduate Student Financial Services website](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/graduate/#_ga=2.174372321.253015999.1584977796-566739165.1584104645). Applicants admitted to our programs are eligible for a range of merit scholarships. These awards are in the form of a tuition discount that reduces the price of the program by a certain percentage and apply for the duration of the program so long as recipients maintain their academic standing. All full-time applicants are automatically considered for merit scholarships at the time of admission. 
The School of Criminology and Criminal Justice has several [“in house” scholarships](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/sccj/resources/sccj-undergraduate-scholarship-applications/), many of which were established by families to honor their criminal justice students and alumni. Most of these scholarships are awarded to upperclassmen who demonstrate academic achievement in specific areas related to the award criteria, as well as financial need. The amount varies annually and may be split between two candidates. SCCJ emails all students annually when the online applications become open to applicants.
