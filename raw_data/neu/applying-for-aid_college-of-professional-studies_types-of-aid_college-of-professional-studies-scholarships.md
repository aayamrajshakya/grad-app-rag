## Outside Scholarships
You must report all private sources of student financial aid to the Northeastern University Office of Student Financial Services in writing. Outside awards are considered part of your aid package and, in most cases, will be applied first to unmet financial need, then to replace loans and/or work-study, and if necessary, to reduce institutional grants and/or scholarships.
