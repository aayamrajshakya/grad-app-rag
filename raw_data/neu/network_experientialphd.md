All of our programs leading to the research doctorate offer students challenging assignments inside our many partner organizations in industry, government, academia, and the nonprofit sector. Northeastern is one of the only universities in the world to offer all PhD students experiential learning opportunities outside of their primary research group. Placements are flexible and customizable, tailored to the interests of students and partners.
