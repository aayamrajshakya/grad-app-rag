[Applying to graduate school](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/applying-to-graduate-school-tips/) is an exciting step in advancing your education and career. But amidst the excitement, the journey from application to acceptance can sometimes feel like navigating a maze of requirements and expectations.
But here’s the good news: there isn’t a one-size-fits-all “perfect” applicant. What truly sets you apart is how well you convey your unique story, ambitions, and potential contributions to your chosen program.
Here are some strategies and insights to help you craft a graduate school application that not only meets all the requirements but also stands out in a competitive applicant pool.
## Understanding the admissions process
When navigating the graduate admissions process, it can be difficult to know what is most important to the review committee. However, there is no “perfect profile” for admission. A standout application authentically reflects who you are and what you aim to achieve in your chosen program.
A typical graduate application includes key components such as:
  * Statement of purpose
  * Letters of recommendation
  * Transcripts and GPA
  * Resumé or Curriculum Vitae (CV)
  * Writing samples or portfolios
  * GRE or GMAT scores (if applicable)


While these elements are important, they are just part of what makes a strong application. Successful applicants understand that graduate admissions committees take a holistic approach, looking beyond grades and test scores to assess each candidate’s unique qualities and potential contributions to the program.
“One of the most common misconceptions is that admission decisions are based solely on metrics like GPA or test scores,” says Mary McNamara, assistant dean of graduate recruitment and admissions at D’Amore-McKim School of Business. “And while these things are important, many admissions processes are holistic.”
For instance, many institutions have adopted a test-optional policy, meaning applicants may provide a test score if it will boost their application, or applicants can demonstrate their value and achievements through the other aspects of the application.
By recognizing that the admissions process is about more than just numbers, you can craft an application that highlights your strengths, experiences, and potential contributions to the program. Here are a few tips that can help you with your application when applying to graduate school.
## How to stand out as a graduate school applicant
### 1. Write a compelling statement of purpose.
The statement of purpose offers you a chance to stand out among fellow applicants. Beyond simply listing achievements and qualifications, you can present a compelling story about who you are and what motivates you.
“We really want to get to know who you are,” McNamara says. “We don’t want your personal statement to be over-engineered. We want it to be authentic, and we want you to shine through.” Your unique voice can transform your application from a collection of documents into a narrative that resonates with the admissions committee.
[A strong statement of purpose](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose/) should include your achievements, goals, and professional experience, but it should also reflect your motivations and how well you align with the program’s values.
“We want to see demonstrated knowledge of our program,” McNamara explains. “If you apply to our [full-time MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/full-time-mba/) program, we want to know that you’ve done the research and that you think our MBA program is a particularly good fit for you.”
Tailoring your statement to each program and institution you are applying to is key, as every program has its own criteria, values, and admissions committee. As McNamara notes, “It’s important to customize your personal statement for each program and institution to increase your chances of acceptance.”
By crafting a thoughtful and genuine statement of purpose, you showcase not just your qualifications but your passion, preparation, and potential, making a strong case for why you belong in the program.
### 2. Secure strong letters of recommendation.
Strong letters of recommendation offer a valuable perspective on your abilities, character, and potential from people who have closely observed your work and growth. A well-written recommendation can highlight qualities that are not easily conveyed through test scores and transcripts, which is vital in a graduate school application.
To [secure strong letters of recommendation](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/grad-school-recommendation/), it’s essential to build and maintain meaningful relationships with your professors, supervisors, or mentors well before you need to ask for a letter.
“Ideally, you’ve been cultivating these relationships,” McNamara says. “So you should start early and give folks plenty of time to prepare a letter of recommendation for you.”
The more time your recommenders have, the better equipped they are to write thoughtful, detailed letters that genuinely reflect your strengths and accomplishments.
When selecting who to ask, choose individuals who know you well and can speak to different aspects of your abilities and character. Don’t ask someone with an impressive title if they can’t provide a personal account of your work ethic or potential.
It’s also crucial to approach potential recommenders with consideration and respect for their time.
“Give people the space to say no. If they don’t have the time or don’t feel like they can provide you with a strong letter, take that response graciously and ask someone else,” McNamara suggests.
A hesitant recommender might not produce the compelling letter you need, so it’s better to seek out someone who is eager and able to support your application fully.
### 3. Optimize your resumé/CV.
Resumés and curriculum vitae (CV) serve different purposes; carefully consider which document will best strengthen your graduate school application and increase your chances of standing out among your peers.
A [resumé](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-write-a-grad-school-resume/) is typically used for business, management, and professional programs. It is a concise, one-page document that highlights your professional experience, skills, and achievements.
“For business programs, management programs, and some professional graduate programs, a resumé is typically what is expected,” McNamara notes.
A CV is often required for academic, scientific, or research-oriented programs. Unlike a resumé, a CV is more detailed and can be several pages long, providing a comprehensive overview of your academic and professional accomplishments.
“For CVs, admissions offices are looking for a comprehensive overview of your academic and professional accomplishments,” McNamara adds.
To optimize your resumé or CV, ensure it aligns with the program’s requirements. For resumés, use bullet points for clarity and prioritize relevant achievements. For CVs, detail your academic history and highlight research and significant contributions in your field. Tailor each document to fit the specific program, effectively showcasing your qualifications and potential.
### 4. Highlight diverse experiences.
Highlight diverse experiences in your graduate school application to stand out to admissions committees. Programs seek candidates who bring varied perspectives, skills, and backgrounds, which enrich classroom discussions, foster collaboration, and prepare students for professional challenges.
At Northeastern, diversity goes beyond just racial or ethnic background.
“We value diversity in all its forms, and we look for candidates who can contribute unique perspectives and experiences to our programs,” McNamara says.
It includes a broad spectrum of factors, such as:
  * Professional experience
  * Academic discipline
  * Cultural background
  * Unique life experiences


To effectively highlight your diverse experiences, consider how different aspects of your background have shaped your personal, academic, and professional journey. Did working in a multicultural team give you unique insights? Has your experience in a non-traditional field provided you with a fresh perspective on your chosen discipline?
Make sure to weave these elements into your application, illustrating not only what makes you unique but also how these experiences have prepared you for the challenges of graduate study and success thereafter.
### 5. Strategically select samples and portfolio items.
When applying to graduate school, the writing samples and portfolio items you submit can significantly impact your application. These elements provide a unique opportunity to showcase your skills, creativity, and depth of thought.
However, it’s not just about selecting your best work—it’s about strategically choosing pieces that complement the rest of your application and tell a cohesive story.
“Think about your application in its entirety,” McNamara advises. “For programs where you’re asked to provide supplemental writing samples, use that opportunity to fill a gap that otherwise is not addressed in your application.”
This means that each piece you submit should add a new dimension to your profile. If your resume emphasizes your research experience, your writing sample could highlight your analytical skills or your ability to communicate complex ideas clearly. By doing so, you ensure that every element of your application contributes to a fuller understanding of your capabilities and potential.
“You want each part of your application to uniquely contribute to your story,” McNamara continues. “And when your application is considered in its entirety, the admissions committee sees a full view of who you are.”
To achieve this, carefully consider what each writing sample or portfolio item says about you. Choose pieces that demonstrate your strengths in areas that other parts of your application may not cover as thoroughly. This might include a project that highlights your innovative thinking, a paper that showcases your deep understanding of a specific topic, or a portfolio piece that reflects your creative approach to problem-solving.
## Start your graduate school application
Crafting a standout graduate school application requires thoughtful preparation and a deep understanding of what admissions committees seek. It’s not just about showcasing your academic achievements but also about highlighting your unique experiences, motivations, and potential contributions to the program.
If you are thinking about applying to graduate school, it is important to start this process early.
“Applicants should be thinking about their application at least six to 12 months before the deadline,” McNamara concludes. “It allows you the time you need for reflection and thorough preparation and can help reduce the stress in what can be a stressful process.”
By starting early and focusing on key elements you can create a well-rounded application that sets you apart.
