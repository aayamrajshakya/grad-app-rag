## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Online Master of Science in Engineering Management offers graduate students an opportunity to develop both technical expertise and management and business competence highly sought after by technology-driven employers. Whether you are planning to change your career path or start a career in technical management, this program provides you with the right skills. The blend of technical proficiency and management skills fostered in this program is designed to prepare graduate students to excel across a wide range of careers in technology-driven industries as well as government organizations. 
The program offers students instruction in how to assist companies in taking products from conception to market. They may play a crucial role in forming and managing teams for assessing cost-effectiveness, designing strategies to improve production, or analyzing supply chains. Most of these projects require an integrated set of skills that require managerial decision making on the one hand and engineering expertise on the other. This skill set enables graduates of this program to serve as technical liaisons within different levels of the organization, often paving the way to senior management roles.
The program curriculum includes four core courses required of all students, designed to establish the essential foundations in economic decision making, quantitative decision modeling, and project management. In addition to these core courses, students can tailor their studies through a wide range of electives, allowing them to pursue either a broad-based path or a more specialized plan of study. For instance, some students may elect to refresh or enhance their technical skills in engineering-based courses such as data analytics and information systems, while others may prefer to broaden their knowledge base by selecting coursework in management subjects such as organizational leadership, financial management, supply chain, lean design, or strategic planning.
