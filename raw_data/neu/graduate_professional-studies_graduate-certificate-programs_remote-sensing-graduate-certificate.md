Remote sensing is the measurement of information by a recording device that is not in physical contact with the object being measured. In practice, remote sensing is the utilization at a distance (as from aircraft, space shuttle, spacecraft, satellite, or ship) of any device for gathering information about the environment. The term remote sensing is most often applied to terrestrial and weather observations but can be applied to planetary environments and astronomy. Remote sensing is applicable to many other situations, including land-use change, pollution tracking, land-use and planning, transportation systems, and military observation.
The online Graduate Certificate in Remote Sensing aims to make education and training in remote sensing available to adult and professional students. The remote sensing certificate program seeks to produce students who are well versed in remote sensing theory, who have hands-on exposure to remote sensing software and hardware, and who have learned how to extract pertinent data from remotely sensed data sets. This six-course certificate program seeks to provide students with the necessary skills and understanding to apply remote sensing knowledge competently and effectively in a variety of areas.
