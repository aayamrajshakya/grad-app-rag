## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
## Course Requirements
Students entering with a bachelor's degree are required to take 48 semester hours of coursework divided between foundational and advanced offerings. Students entering the program will be allowed to place out of some (possibly all) of the six basic-level courses; the graduate coordinator together with the first-year graduate advisor will determine the allowable course substitutions and will advise the student which foundational courses to take. Students may satisfy requirements for Algebra 1 (MATH 5111) and Analysis 1: Functions of One Variable (MATH 5101) by taking
## Teaching Requirement
Some teaching experience is required while in the program. Students must attend university-led TA training at the start of the program; attend a one-semester TA training course conducted by faculty from the Department of Mathematics teaching committee; spend one semester shadowing faculty in the undergraduate classroom; and perform recitations and grading for the undergraduate course they are shadowing.
## Qualifying Exams
Qualifying exam sessions are given once in spring and once in fall. Students will be required to pass four qualifying exams: algebra 1, analysis 1, and two other exams. The possible additional topics for qualifying exams are algebra 2, analysis 2, combinatorics, geometry, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, probability, statistics, topology, and algebraic geometry. A qualifying exam may be taken twice by any student. Additional attempts may be allowed at the discretion of the graduate committee with permission from the graduate dean in the College of Science. Two qualifying exams should be passed no later than the end of the second year and all four by the end of the third year.
## Doctoral Candidacy
PhD candidacy is reached when all of the following conditions are met:
  * Completion of eight advanced courses
  * Identification of an unsolved research problem
  * Successful passing of four qualifying exams
  * Assignment of PhD supervisor and creation of a 1-page initial plan
  * Completion of a 3-page plan of research
  * Completion of a 10-page progress report and a one-hour defense of proposal, presented to supervisor and three faculty members of graduate committee


## Dissertation Requirement
Each candidate must complete a dissertation that embodies the results of extended research and makes an original contribution to the field. This work should give evidence of the candidate’s ability to carry out independent investigation and interpret, in a logical manner, the results of the research. There are two stages to this process:
  * Stage 1:
  * Stage 2 (dissertation defense):

## Course Requirements
Advanced students who enter the PhD program with a master's degree (or equivalent) will be allowed to place out of some (possibly all) of the six basic-level courses; the graduate coordinator together with the first-year graduate advisor will determine the allowable course substitutions and will advise the student which foundational courses to take. Students may satisfy requirements for Algebra 1 (MATH 5111)Analysis 1: Functions of One Variable (MATH 5101) by taking qualifying exams in algebra 1 and in analysis 1 at the start of the program. Students may satisfy foundational course requirements if they demonstrate proficiency by passing an assessment exam in the course at the beginning of the semester or by demonstrating that they have taken a similar course and have adequate knowledge of the course material (syllabus and transcript are required; a brief oral examination is also required in that case). Academic advising will happen just before the start of each term and during the add/drop period in order to plan a student’s course registration for the term. A complete listing of foundational and advanced courses is available from the Department of Mathematics and the graduate dean’s office. Students are not permitted to register for more than two “readings” courses and three “topics” courses for credit toward the degree without explicit permission from the graduate dean. A minimum grade-point average (GPA) of 3.000 is required for degree conferral.
## Teaching Requirement
Some teaching experience is required while in the program. Students must attend university-led TA training at the start of the program; attend a one-semester TA training course conducted by faculty from the Department of Mathematics teaching committee; spend one semester shadowing faculty in the undergraduate classroom; and perform recitations and grading for the undergraduate course they are shadowing.
## Qualifying Exams
Qualifying exam sessions are given once in spring and once in fall. Students will be required to pass four qualifying exams: algebra 1, analysis 1, and two other exams. The possible additional topics for qualifying exams are algebra 2, analysis 2, combinatorics, geometry, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, probability, statistics, topology, and algebraic geometry. A qualifying exam may be taken twice by any student. Additional attempts may be allowed at the discretion of the graduate committee with permission from the graduate dean in the College of Science. Two qualifying exams should be passed no later than the end of the second year and all four by the end of the third year.
## Doctoral Candidacy
PhD candidacy is reached when all of the following conditions are met:
  * Completion of eight advanced courses
  * Identification of an unsolved research problem
  * Successful passing of four qualifying exams
  * Assignment of PhD supervisor and creation of a 1-page initial plan
  * Completion of a 3-page plan of research
  * Completion of a 10-page progress report and a one-hour defense of proposal, presented to supervisor and three faculty members of graduate committee


## Dissertation Requirement
Each candidate must complete a dissertation that embodies the results of extended research and makes an original contribution to the field. This work should give evidence of the candidate’s ability to carry out independent investigation and interpret, in a logical manner, the results of the research. There are two stages to this process:
  * Stage 1:
  * Stage 2 (dissertation defense):
