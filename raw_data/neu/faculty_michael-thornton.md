Assistant Teaching Professor of History 
Michael Thornton teaches and researches Japanese and East Asian history, with a particular interest in the history of cities and urbanization. He has two major projects underway: the first focuses on the relationship between urbanization and colonial expansion on Japan’s northern frontier, Hokkaido, during the nineteenth century. The second is “A People’s Guide to Tokyo,” a collaborative project with scholars in Japan and across the United States.
