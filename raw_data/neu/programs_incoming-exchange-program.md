## Courses & Transcripts
As an international exchange student at Northeastern, you will be registered as a full-time, non-degree seeking undergraduate student. You can select your courses from most of the schools and colleges at Northeastern University as long as you meet the prerequisites for the course.
  
Course Credits   

Most classes at Northeastern are worth 4 credits each. Your study abroad advisor will help explain how these 4 credits will convert to your home university’s credit system.
Exchange students must maintain full-time status at Northeastern and not violate their J-1 visa status requirements. This means that you must register for at least 12 credits per semester. You cannot register for more than 18 credits. For most students, this means taking 3 or 4 academic classes per semester.
  
Course Descriptions and Syllabi   

Descriptions of Northeastern classes can be found in the [Northeastern Course Catalog](https://registrar.northeastern.edu/group/academic-catalogs/#_ga=2.119544010.355633878.1602593414-912837580.1601471513). This is a full list of courses offered throughout the year. You can use the previous fall or spring offerings as a guide for choosing your courses, however there is no guarantee that the exact same courses will be offered.
If you require a course syllabus ahead of time for approval by your home university, please contact us via email at [[email protected]](https://geo.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8beceee4e2e5e8e4e6e2e5eceef3e8e3eae5eceecbe5e4f9ffe3eeeaf8ffeef9e5a5eeeffe).

Course Scheduling   

To learn when certain courses are offered, use the [Dynamic Scheduling Tool](https://nubanner.neu.edu/StudentRegistrationSsb/ssb/term/termSelection?mode=search#_ga=2.28480126.395186098.1658846303-296945762.1656099903). Start by selecting the term/semester in which you are looking for a course. Please note, that not all courses are offered in every semester. This is the recommended method for finding courses to take during your Northeastern experience. Use this tool while completing your GEO Incoming Exchange Application to select your courses and to discuss these course selections with your international office advisor before coming to Boston.
  
Course Registration Process   

GEO will register you for your classes before you come to Northeastern based on the course selection form you submitted. We cannot guarantee enrollment into any particular course, so be flexible when planning your course schedule. Follow the steps below to register for your courses.
#### Step 1: Select Your Courses
You are required tosubmit 8 – 10 courses identified by the Northeastern Course Catalog and the Dynamic Scheduling Tool. Remember that you will be taking a total of 3 or 4 courses at Northeastern; the other courses will be used as backup options.
#### Step 2: Review Requirements
Carefully review all prerequisites listed for every class you are interested in taking and meet with your advisor to ensure that you meet those requirements. If prerequisites are listed, you will have to provide evidence (usually your transcript and/or syllabi from the course) to show that you meet these requirements. Make sure you do not choose any courses listed in the Course Restrictions section above.
Many courses also have multiple components such as co-requisites, lectures, discussions, and/or labs. Pay attention to these requirements (outlined in the Dynamic Schedule) to ensure that you end up registered for all requisite components of your desired courses.
#### Step 3: Review Schedule
When you have found 3 – 4 classes for which you believe you are qualified, check their scheduled days and time using the dynamic search tool to ensure there are no scheduling conflicts. You must attend each class at it’s scheduled time; you are not permitted to register for classes that have overlapping time slots.
#### Step 4: Register for Classes
Once you have completed your course request application, the GEO registrar will begin the process of registering you for courses. Please note that any course change requests must be supported with a strong academic reason.
#### Add/Drop Period
There is an Add/Drop period at the beginning of every semester when you can make changes to your class schedule if necessary. See [Registrar schedule](https://registrar.northeastern.edu/article/calendar-current-year/) for the exact dates.
#### Classes that are Full or Unavailable
Northeastern cannot guarantee enrollment in a course, which is why it is required to choose 4 courses and 4 alternates. In addition to restrictions listed above, courses may be full before it is your turn to register. Please be flexible when planning your courses.
If a particular class is already full, it may be possible to gain admission. There are three ways to do this:
  * If another student drops the course.
  * Via waitlist.
  * During the Add/Drop period.


  
Transcripts   

GEO will send official transcripts to students’ home institutions upon completion of the semester or academic year. Students can view their unofficial transcripts via the Student Hub or request copies of their official transcripts via Parchment.
  
Grading and Assessments   

You can find details of [Northeastern’s grading system here](https://registrar.northeastern.edu/article/university-grading-system/). Final grades in your classes are typically a weighted average of the combined classwork in a course, which can include homework, essays, class participation, and exams. All of your classes and grades from Northeastern will be reported to your home university.

## Visa & Travel Info
While many documents are required by federal regulations for you to enter into and study in the U.S., your passport, DS-2019, and nonimmigrant visa are the three most critical. You must make sure that these documents are accurate and remain valid throughout your stay in the United States.
### Passport
You must have a valid passport to apply for a DS-2019 and a visa. Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the last day of your program. If your name shown on your passport has changed for any reason, carry official name-change documentation with your passport. (For example, bring an original marriage certificate documenting a name change.)
### Certificate of Eligibility: The DS-2019
The DS-2019 indicates that an international applicant has been accepted as a full-time, non-degree exchange student, with the required proficiency in the English language (documented by TOEFL test scores or their equivalent), with sufficient financial support (documented in the DCF form) to study at a U.S. academic institution.
Once you have been accepted to study at Northeastern University, OGS initiates the process of issuing your DS-2019. You must have this form before you can obtain your J-1 exchange visitor visa to attend a school in the U.S. It is also required in order to maintain lawful student status when transferring or changing schools within the U.S.
### Visa Application Process
For information on obtaining a nonimmigrant student visa, please visit the [Office of Global Services](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/visa-application/j-1-student-visa-process/).
