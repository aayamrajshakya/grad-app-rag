[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Boston in Literature](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL/AFAM 2690
Each semester, the course focuses on a different aspect of Boston in literature, such as representations of Boston’s different communities, different historical eras, particular genres or concepts associated with the city, and so forth. Offers students an opportunity to build upon their readings about the city by experiencing independent site visits, class field trips, guest speakers, and other activities. 
  * ###  [Opening the Archive](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 4400
Offers a seminar designed to introduce students to the rich archival holdings in the greater Boston area and to offer training in the materials and methods of primary source research. Primary materials include a wide range of resources, including books, manuscripts, letters, pamphlets, broadsides, journals, maps, illustrations, photographs, etc., from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries. 


### [Literature and Digital Diversity ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 2150
Focuses on the use of digital methods to analyze and archive literary texts, emphasizing issues of diversity and inclusion. Covers three main areas: text encoding, textual analysis, and archive construction. Considers literary texts and corpora, including works by well-known authors such as Shakespeare, together with collections by marginalized writers, including slave narratives and writings by early modern women. Offers students an opportunity to explore what counts as literature and how computers, databases, and analytical tools give substance to concepts of aesthetic, cultural, and intellectual value as inflected by race and gender.
