Northeastern University offers several meal plans aimed at suiting a variety of student needs. Experience the best of Northeastern Dining every day with the meal plan that works best for you! All first-year students living in [University Housing](https://huskycard.northeastern.edu/meal-plan-required-housing-2024/) are required to be enrolled in a traditional meal plan as well as continuing students (second-year and above) living in [meal plan required housing](https://huskycard.northeastern.edu/meal-plan-required-housing-2024/). All other full-time, actively enrolled students have the option to enroll in any of the Traditional Meal Plans or Community Meal Plans of their choosing.
All changes to your meal plan can be made via the [Meal Plan Online](https://mercury.neu.edu/page/MealPlanOnline) portal within the [Student Hub](https://me.northeastern.edu/). Meal plan required students have until the second Friday after the start of the semester at 5:00 pm EST to make changes to their meal plan. Other students may add a plan at any time, but may not make changes or cancel after the term deadline.
