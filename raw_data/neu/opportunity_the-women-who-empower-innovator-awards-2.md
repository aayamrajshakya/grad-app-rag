The Women Who Empower Innovator Awards celebrate bold, creative changemakers in Northeastern’s vast entrepreneurial ecosystem—and provide them with the capital, resources, and network to elevate their ideas, products, businesses, and brands.
The Innovator Awards are unique as they recognize the innovators themselves—not just the strength of their idea or venture. Since 2021, we have bestowed Innovator Awards upon 69 recipients representing all Northeastern schools and colleges and a wide range of industries including health, sustainability, finance, fashion, and technology.
The application deadline for the Innovator Awards is March 25, 2024. We invite submissions from Northeastern’s global community, including all students and alumnae, including alumnae of Northeastern in Oakland (formerly Mills College) and Northeastern University London (formerly New College of the Humanities), and program alumnae of the Roux Founder Residency and Lab for Inclusive Entrepreneurship. Candidates can be at any stage of their venture, from exploring a promising idea to scaling an existing business concept.
