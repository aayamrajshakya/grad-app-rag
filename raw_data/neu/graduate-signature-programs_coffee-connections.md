Connect with campus! Designed just for graduate and professional students, _Coffee Connections_ is a weekly event series in Boston that features warmth, resources, and giveaways. This event series is a terrific way to learn about what resources are available to you here at Northeastern University and to meet the offices and organizations who support you–all over a free cup of coffee, tea, and pastries, courtesy of the Center for Student Involvement. Whether you’re grabbing and going, chatting with one of our campus partners, or relaxing with your friends, all are welcome. No strings attached: all you need is your Husky Card!
We look forward to seeing you every Wednesday starting at 9:30am in Snell Library Quad, from September 10 through October 29 2025! _All coffee, tea, and pastries are while supplies last. Rain location: West Mezzanine in the Curry Student Center._
