#  U.S. Department of State Resumes New Visa Issuance 
Updated June 20, 2025 
> ### June 20, 2025 - U.S. Department of State Resumes Scheduling F/J Visa Appointments!
The U.S. Department of State has officially resumed scheduling visa interviews for F-1 and J-1 student visa applicants. This means that students and scholars can now book their visa appointment at a local U.S. embassy or consulate. This is great news for all incoming international students preparing to join us for the upcoming academic term, and for all returning students who traveled home this summer and have an expired visa.
In addition, as part of new screening procedures implemented by the Department of State (DOS):
  * Applicants must be prepared for their online presence to be reviewed as part of the visa application process
  * Applicants are required to set their social media profiles to "public"


**OGS continues to advise current students**
**Next Steps for New Incoming Students:**
  * **Form I-20 (F-1) and Form DS-2019 (J-1) requests:** If you have not already, please submit your [request for an I-20](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.northeastern.edu%2Fogs%2Fnew-students%2Fi-20-ds-2019-application%2Fprearrivali20%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cj.christ%40northeastern.edu%7C6a5be3a89dc04ff4ddcd08dd9ec9c277%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638841311570065736%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=C%2BjxTBoqfSaZundAIRfjwmeiMJUk1TnpB52U2ukCUc8%3D&reserved=0) or your [request for the DS-2019](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/applying-as-a-j-1-student/). Please be attentive that processing of these forms can take up to 15 business days. Be sure to submit your request as soon as possible.
  * **Schedule Your Interview Promptly:** Due to high demand and potential backlogs, we strongly encourage you to book your visa interview as soon as possible through your local U.S. embassy or consulate. Check the website of your local U.S. embassy or consulate regularly for the latest updates and appointment availability.
  * **Visa Status Update:** Please keep us updated by completing OGS’ [visa status e-form](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmyogs.northeastern.edu%2Fistart%2Fcontrollers%2Fclient%2FClientEngine.cfm%3Fserviceid%3DEFormVisaApplicationStatus0ServiceProvider&data=05%7C02%7Cj.christ%40northeastern.edu%7C6a5be3a89dc04ff4ddcd08dd9ec9c277%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638841311570086235%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=DdiYbc3ueJ7HJng9Y247Zt%2BuXDOA6zrGR6ECXWIHHZw%3D&reserved=0) regularly so that we can remain aware of your progress in the application process and make appropriate plans for your arrival.  If you encounter delays or need assistance, please notify us via the visa status e-form. We’re here to help with documentation requested by the embassy/consulate, deferral options, and any other concerns.
  * **Already in the U.****S.?:** If you're already in the U.S. and are transferring your SEVIS record or changing your immigration status, you do not need to leave the country for the sole purpose of renewing your visa. However, it’s important that you promptly apply for your I-20 and DS-2019 and ensure your records are updated correctly.
  * **Course Registration:** If you have not yet registered for your courses, you may do so in the [student hub](https://me.northeastern.edu/).


We’re excited to welcome you to our campus community. Please keep us updated about your progress so we can best support you with your transition to campus.

> ### May 27, 2025 - U.S. Department of State Pauses New Visa Issuance
On May 27, 2025, reports surfaced that the U.S. Department of State temporarily paused the scheduling of new F-1/J-1 visa appointments while it reviews its procedures related to social media screening as part of the visa application process. We are closely monitoring the situation and will provide updates as soon as more information becomes available. At this time, we understand that this pause is temporary, but no specific timeline has been provided for when new interviews will resume.
**In the meantime, we recommend the following:**
  1. If you have not already, please submit your [request for an I-20 (new F-1 students).](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternational.northeastern.edu%2Fogs%2Fnew-students%2Fi-20-ds-2019-application%2Fprearrivali20%2F&data=05%7C02%7Cj.christ%40northeastern.edu%7C6a5be3a89dc04ff4ddcd08dd9ec9c277%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638841311570065736%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=C%2BjxTBoqfSaZundAIRfjwmeiMJUk1TnpB52U2ukCUc8%3D&reserved=0) Or your request for a DS-2019 ([new J-1 students](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/i-20-ds-2019-application/applying-as-a-j-1-student/) or [new J-1 scholars](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/exchange-visitor-program/j-1-scholars/visa-process-for-j-1-scholars/)).
