Learn more about the COE PlusOne Co-op Program
Northeastern’s co-op program offers students a unique opportunity to integrate their academic knowledge with industry. Students may gain up to eight months of work experience, allowing them to learn more about their fields through hands-on application of skills, build their resumes, earn an income, and gain a competitive edge for post-graduate employment opportunities.
Participation in a co-op at the master’s degree level is an opportunity for students who have achieved excellent academic progress and success and who demonstrate professionalism and a readiness to further their learning with workplace experience.
During their search period, eligible students work one-on-one with a knowledgeable advisor to prepare their search materials, identify appropriate positions, and hone their networking and interviewing skills to ultimately secure a co-op role.
PlusOne master’s degree students may participate in one co-op work experience with a single company during their program of study if they have completed two or fewer co-ops during their undergraduate degree program. The experience may be full-time (32+ hours per week) and can range from 4-8 months in duration.

  3. The student must return to campus for at least one semester (at least 4SH) after the co-op work experience.

  1. Full-time co-ops are required to be 32-40 hours per week. Half-time co-op positions (16-31 hours/week) may be approved in certain cases with the expectation that students take a minimum number of credits concurrently to maintain their full-time student status.

Toggle Accordion  PlusOne Master’s Students – Taking a Course While on Co-op 
During co-op, the student’s primary focus should be on the co-op work experience. Students may not take a course during full-time co-op, or more than one course during a half-time co-op, without special approval from their co-op coordinator. Approval will only be granted for special circumstances such as avoiding delaying graduation for a prerequisite. This option is only available to students who have completed 25SH or fewer (33SH or fewer for Academic Link students) before starting a co-op.
If approved: The course must not meet during the student’s regularly scheduled co-op workday. The work schedule cannot be changed to accommodate a course. The course must not have a lab, recitation, or other co-requisite. The course must not be an Experiential Project course.
