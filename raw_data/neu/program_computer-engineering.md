Northeastern offers a PhD in Computer Engineering that is completely research-based with minimal and flexible course requirements, which can be pursued as full-time or part-time.
Applicants can enter the PhD program with either a BS or an MS degree in computer engineering or a closely related field. Students entering the program with a BS degree need to also complete MS requirements, which includes selecting a concentration for the master’s component.
As a computer engineering student at Northeastern, you will study computer architecture, software engineering, computer-aided design (VLSI), microprocessor-based design, and applied algorithms. In addition to a broad background in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, this curriculum gives you a solid foundation in both hardware and software design. RISC microprocessors, object-oriented Java, and cellular networks are just three of the technologies you will encounter in the program.
The internet has revolutionized all aspects of our lives, from the way we communicate to the way we do business. Wireless communication, online commerce, medicine, and multimedia are examples of new applications that have transformed our world. Computer engineers developed the fundamental technologies that made the web possible, including high-performance microprocessors, gigabit networks, and object-oriented computer languages. Students with a strong background in computer engineering are aggressively recruited by cutting-edge computer companies nationwide.
Unique Features
  * A variety of graduate courses gives students the flexibility in planning their course requirements according to their research requirements and personal interests.
  * Many graduate courses are offered in two sections; in-class and streaming video. Part-time students who have schedule conflicts can register in the streaming video sections.
  * Northeastern ECE is the host or major partner in 10 state-of-the-art research centers.
  * Financial support is available.
  * Internationally-recognized Internships and co-op opportunities.
  * Professional Development Workshop series to complement the research and classroom experiences.
  * Northeastern ECE is a research powerhouse in the Boston area and beyond.


Program Objectives
  * An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems.
  * An ability to produce solutions that meet specified end-user needs
  * An ability to explain and apply engineering design principles, as appropriate to the program’s educational objectives
  * An ability to apply analytical, numerical, and/or experimental methods to analyze and design complex engineering systems, and to identify, formulate, and solve new challenging electrical engineering problems
  * An ability to direct independent scientific research in electrical engineering and related fields
  * An ability to formulate new research plans and communicate the research outcomes through oral and written communication


Experiential Learning
With the large number of high-tech firms in and around Boston, both start-ups and large multinational corporations, many PhD students do an internship during their program while remaining right here in Boston. Often their advisor is instrumental in identifying the internship position, with a funding sponsor or research collaborator, be they in Boston or elsewhere in the United States. Internships can be informally arranged for several months at any time during the calendar year, and PhD students can also take advantage of the more formally arranged co-op program which entails 6 months of work experience preceded by several professional development courses to prepare students.
Post Graduation
Our graduates pursue careers within academia and beyond.
