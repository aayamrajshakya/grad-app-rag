This project is the result of interdisciplinary collaboration to re-examine and evaluate the external political efficacy constructs used in the American National Election Survey. These measures of how people perceive government responsiveness have gone largely unchanged since their conception in the 1950s despite having reliability and validity issues. We argue for an overhaul of the current measures and propose robust, viable alternatives. Using qualitative and quantitative research, we present a new external efficacy construct. Pre-tests have found our new measure to be robust to theoretical expectations and consistent across subgroups.
