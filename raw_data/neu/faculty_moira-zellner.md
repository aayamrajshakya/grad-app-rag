#  MoiraZellner
Professor of Public Policy and Urban Affairs; Director of Participatory Modeling and Data Science; Director, MS in Urban Informatics Program; Co-Director of NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science 
Moira Zellner’s academic background lies at the intersection of Urban and Regional Planning, Environmental Science, and Complexity. She has served as Principal Investigator and Co-Investigator in interdisciplinary projects **[participatory complex systems modeling](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/policyschool/participatory-modeling/)** with stakeholders and decision-makers can support collaborative policy exploration, social learning, and system-wide transformation. Moira has taught a variety of workshops on complexity-based modeling of socio-ecological systems, for training of both scientists and decision-makers in the US and abroad. She has served the academic community spanning across the social and natural sciences, as reviewer of journals and grants and as a member of various scientific organizations. She is dedicated to serving the public through her engaged research and activism.
Before coming to Northeastern, Moira was an Associate Professor in the Department of Urban Planning and Policy and the Institute for Environmental Science and Policy at University of Illinois at Chicago. She also headed the Urban Data Visualization Lab at UIC. Prior to her academic career, Moira worked as an environmental consultant for local and international environmental engineering firms and for the undersecretary of Environment in the City of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [Agent-Based Modeling for Applied and Social Sciences](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?search=INSH+6101+)
#### INSH 6101
Introduces complexity-based models, most notably agent-based models, and their possible applications to a range of planning and public policy issues. Exposes students to complexity theory and methods, including interactions, adaptation, and evolution; cellular automata, agents, networks, and genetic algorithms; and epistemology—the meaning and applications of models. Focuses on modeling and software, including building on sample models; running experiments and analyzing results; and verification, sensitivity, and validation. 
  * ###  [Dynamic Modeling for Environmental Decision Making](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/search/?search=PPUA+5261)
#### PPUA 5261
Introduces the theory, methods, and tools of dynamic modeling for policy and investment decision making, with special focus on environmental issues. Makes use of state-of-the-art computing methods to translate theory and concepts into executable models and provides extensive hands-on modeling experience. Topics include discounting, intertemporal optimization, dynamic games, and treatment of uncertainty. 
  * ### Participatory Modeling for Knowledge Co-Production and Collaborative Decision-Making
#### PPUA 5390-2
Participatory modeling is a collaborative approach to formalize shared representations of a problem that allows researchers and policymakers to design and test solutions to that problem. Using various modeling techniques, participatory modeling helps elicit diverse stakeholder knowledge and harnesses this diversity to move from conflict to solutions. The collaborative approach strengthens relationship-building, empathy, trust, systems thinking, and collective agency for decision-making.
