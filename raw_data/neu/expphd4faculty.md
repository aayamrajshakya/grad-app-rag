Experiential PhD is a series of distinctive pathways that provide PhD students and postdoctoral research associates opportunities to acquire experiences in authentic settings from laboratories to startup companies to nonprofit institutions, leading to greater impact and broader career opportunities, both within and beyond academia. 
Our Experiential PhD opportunities are designed to advance knowledge and innovation by aligning academic pursuits with real-world industry challenges. Faculty gain access to new industry contacts, equipment, and PhD students grounded in use-inspired research. Through access to fresh talent, our corporate partners augment their in-house innovation capacity while also strengthening their workforce development pipeline.
With Experiential PhD, faculty can gain:
  * training that develops PhD student and Postdoctoral researcher associates’ leadership, teamwork, and orientation to grounded, in-use research
  * distinct pathways to engage industry and international partners 
  * funding for PhD students 


We have executed over 120 academic partnerships since 2017. Faculty can participate in Experiential PhD across four pathways:

LEADERs
LEADERs is a distinctive professional development initiative. All PhD students and Postdoctoral Researchers are eligible to enroll in Leading Self and Others where they build teamwork and leadership competencies they can apply to their work at NU. PhD students who pursue the Experiential PhD Research Graduate Certificate or LEADERs certificate complete a LEADERs internship, which is an academic placement. These internships usually last one to two semesters and the student receives a minimum of two semesters of fellowship funding, making it a useful tool to bridge grants.View open [LEADERs internship opportunities](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=e9e75df38af3489684d268e4566702fa) using your Northeastern credentials.
