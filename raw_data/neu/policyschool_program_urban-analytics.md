#  Graduate Certificate Urban Analytics
With seventy-five percent of the world’s population projected to be living in cities by 2050, the need for professionals in urban planning and related careers will only increase. The Graduate Certificate in Urban Analytics prepares students to manage the progressively complex issues involved with rapidly expanding data and technological resources in cities. As Claire Lane of the City of Boston recently noted, “The blueprints for great cities are increasingly anchored in big data, expressed in GIS [Geographic Information Systems] and codified in coherent policy.” Graduates with an Urban Analytics certificate will have skills in each of these areas; this will adequately prepare them to be professionals ready to shape the future of cities across the globe.
Students will be trained with the practical and theoretical knowledge necessary to understand the intricacies of interconnected urban systems and to analyze how these systems work together to create sustainable, resilient, and just cities. The curriculum emphasizes the expertise needed to bridge emerging technological capacities and traditional policy making processes. Students will cultivate applied skills in visual presentation, analysis, and modeling of new dataset—all of which will help to inform investment and policy making. Inspired by Northeastern’s leadership in experiential education, students will use Boston and cities around the world as learning labs.
