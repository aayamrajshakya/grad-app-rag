#  Master of Arts English
The Master of Arts in English degree launches students into the study of literature, writing, and rhetoric at the graduate level. The program offers 1.5-2 years of intensive study in the major fields of British and American literature and rhetoric and composition, covering the debates and approaches that animate the discipline of English. Our MA in English graduates are fully prepared to proceed to study at the doctoral level, and their training in critical thinking, language skills, and cultural history has also proven to be fruitful preparation for a range of careers outside of academia.
Graduates of our M.A. program are able to:
  * Employ primary and secondary materials to analyze critical debates and positionality within subfields of English.
  * Demonstrate expertise in theories; methods; and social, cultural, and political histories of three subfields of English studies pertinent to the student’s plan of research and teaching.
  * Formulate and defend original and critically significant arguments, communicating them effectively in genres relevant to English studies (e.g., research papers, conference presentations, digital projects).
  * Design and conduct sustained, sophisticated, independent research to make a critical contribution to subfields within English studies by engaging in analytical thinking, investigating relationships between language and power, or critiquing inherited social structures and hierarchies within and beyond the field(s).
