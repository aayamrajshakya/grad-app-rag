## What is the Fast App?
Northeastern Online's Fast App is a performance-based admissions pathway which allows you to earn graduate admission by completing real coursework. No need to gather application materials. No need to wait for an admissions decision. Let your performance in your coursework serve as your application into your graduate program.

## How it works
Step 1: Choose your program and submit your Fast App.
  * Once reviewed, we will start creating your student account and credentials (typically takes less than 72 hours).


Step 2: You'll get an email to enroll in up to two performance-based admissions (PBA) courses.
  * All PBA course credits earned get applied to intended degree upon successful completion of PBA process.
  * Pay $399 enrollment deposit (applied to first tuition payment) at time of enrollment.


Step 3: Get a B or better in both PBA courses and submit your official undergraduate transcript before you finish your PBA courses.
  * [View our domestic and international transcript resources.](https://online.northeastern.edu/transcripts/)
  * Submitting official transcripts as early as possible is strongly encouraged.


Step 4: Continue into your degree program and bring all your PBA credits with you. 
Note:not eligible for F-1 visa sponsorship
## Cost
There are no additional costs for starting through the performance-based admission (PBA) pathway. You’ll pay the same per-credit tuition rate as students enrolled in the full degree program. A one-time enrollment deposit is required at the time of registration. This deposit is applied to your first tuition bill.
Tuition rates vary by program. Visit your program page for the most up-to-date tuition information.
