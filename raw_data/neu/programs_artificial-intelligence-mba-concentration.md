> AI and machine learning are super useful in business today, and I knew I wanted to get a better grasp of those concepts; essentially, learn them in detail and understand the actual math behind many of these algorithms that we take for granted. For instance, when you search on Google or YouTube, there's actually tons and tons of data being passed through these algorithms and models, but we don't think twice about it. With my background in computer science, the MBA x Artificial Intelligence concentration was a perfect fit.
