The PhD in Network Science is an interdisciplinary program supported jointly by the Bouvé College of Health Sciences, College of Arts, Media and Design, College of Science, D’Amore-McKim School of Business, College of Social Sciences and Humanities, and Khoury College of Computer Sciences. Our interdisciplinary program provides the conceptual and mathematical tools needed to describe and predict networks in an ever-evolving field. You’ll learn a range of network-based approaches, and will become proficient in relational (graph-based), mathematical, and algorithmic techniques, as well as fundamental network theories that can be used to explain mechanisms and processes of networks across domains—in physical, technological, informational, and social systems.
As the only Network Science program based in the U.S., our curriculum provides a scholarly experience that is truly one of a kind. The program fosters intellectual and quantitative agility, enabling you to combine theoretically-driven inquiries with data collection and analytic tools and theories—while also understanding when, and in what contexts, particular techniques are appropriate and meaningful.
Northeastern University is a world leader in Network Science, and faculty affiliated with the program include prominent leaders in the field such as Albert-László Barabási, Alessandro Vespignani, Tina Eliassi-Rad, David Lazer, and Esteban Moro. Graduates will be well-prepared to enter into a number of career paths, including industry research positions, government analyst positions, and post-doctoral or junior faculty positions in academic institutions. Students have the opportunity to work with some of the most prominent network scientists in the world. With frequent guest lecturers and workshop series, students have access to diverse scientists and global leaders in the field.
Unique Features
  * Northeastern has several leading laboratories and centers in Network Science, with dozens of faculty, postdoctoral fellows, visiting faculty, and doctoral students
  * A select cohort of graduate students from varied academic and research backgrounds learning in the same physical space
  * Frequent guest lecturers, workshop series, and faculty-led conferences
  * Access to a growing alumni body of successful professionals, an expanding roster of talented research scientists and post-docs, and new learning opportunities across the Northeastern University global network


Program Objectives
INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
Faculty and researchers at the Network Science Institute cover many subject areas in the physical sciences (physics, mathematics, psychology); social sciences (political science, urban networks, communication); health science (epidemiology); and computer and information sciences.
FOUNDATIONAL TRAINING
Foundational training in developing and understanding analytical models and tools, formal methods of network representation, dynamical processes, social structures, and integration of machine learning begin in the first year of the program. This knowledge will help students build an inherently interdisciplinary approach to science, launching the next generation of researchers.
IDEAS + TECHNIQUES
Learning to combine theoretical concepts and substantive questions with the appropriate tools and techniques for data collection and analyses is a key element of the program. Students will be combining ideas, techniques, and collaborations into the novel interdisciplinary approaches that are paramount to Network Science.
Career Outlook
Network Science is a major interdisciplinary research area with applications in data science and data analytics methodologies. Network scientists are employed in academia, government, and business. Graduates have obtained industry, government, post-doctoral, and faculty positions at:
  * Santa Fe Institute
  * Max Planck Institute
  * Rutgers University
  * Stanford University
  * Center for International Security and Cooperation
  * National Institutes for Health (USA)
  * Center for Disease Control
  * Amazon
  * Google
