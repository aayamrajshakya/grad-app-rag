Boston campus concentrations 
##  Boston campus concentrations 
All students complete core math, programming, AI, machine learning, and ethics courses. Students at the Boston campus then branch into one of five concentrations for real-world applications. Each concentration provides many opportunities for hands-on project work.
Robotics and agent-based systems (Khoury College)
This concentration teaches you to build autonomous machines that function in dynamic environments. You might design warehouse robots navigating crowded aisles to pack orders or develop simulations helping planners anticipate interactions between self-driving cars and human-driven vehicles. Courses such as “Reinforcement Learning” and “Robotic Sensing” give you tools to program robots that learn from experience — such as drones adapting flight paths or robotic arms handling varied objects.
Machine learning (Khoury College)
This track emphasizes building and refining AI models for practical industry applications, from health care to finance. You might develop NLP tools analyzing patient records for health risks or deep learning algorithms optimizing credit assessments for banks. Courses such as “Deep Learning” train you to manage large datasets, creating medical image classifiers or streaming service recommendation systems. Through hands-on projects, you’ll learn to deploy robust, ethical AI solutions into real-world environments.
Energy systems (College of Engineering)
In this concentration, you’ll apply AI to create smarter, sustainable energy infrastructures. Examples include developing predictive models for wind turbine maintenance or reinforcement-learning systems balancing solar and battery power. Courses in renewable energy integration and scientific machine learning teach you to coordinate diverse energy resources effectively. Be a part of AI tools assisting utilities in forecasting demand and reducing carbon emissions through optimized energy management and more.
Continuous process engineering (College of Engineering)
You’ll integrate AI into manufacturing and industrial processes to enhance safety, efficiency, and product quality. You might design algorithms predicting equipment failures before production is disrupted or build systems that monitor pharmaceutical manufacturing for contamination risks. Foundational classes like “Process Safety and Computational Modeling” prepare you to apply predictive analytics effectively, while electives offer deeper insights into industrial data strategies.
Computer vision (College of Engineering)
This concentration trains you to build systems that interpret visual data, applied to areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. You might create software analyzing medical scans for early disease detection or vision algorithms enabling cars to identify pedestrians and road signs. Courses such as “Advanced Computer Vision” and “Data Visualization” help you efficiently process large image sets, like satellite imagery tracking environmental changes.
These concentrations are available only at the Boston location; your degree will be awarded by the college that is home to your chosen concentration.

Learning outcomes 
##  Learning outcomes 
The MS in Artificial Intelligence will prepare you to:
  * Understand representations, algorithms, and techniques used across the AI industry and academia and be able to apply and evaluate them in applications as well as develop your own.
  * Understand the basic processes that an agent must perform, from perceiving its environment, making decisions on how to act and performing those actions, as well be able to develop and evaluate the technology that can be used to perform these processes.
  * Understand and apply machine learning techniques to draw inferences from data and help automate the development of AI systems and components.
  * Understand the various ways and reasons humans are integrated into mixed human-AI environments, whether it is to improve overall integrated system performance, improve AI performance, or influence human performance and learning.
  * Understand the ethical concerns in developing responsible AI technologies.
  * Model human behavior, develop human-AI systems, and evaluate their performance.
  * Demonstrate knowledge of the use of AI algorithms and processes in one of the specialization areas: robotics and agent-based systems, vision, intelligent interaction, machine learning, and knowledge representation and reasoning.


  
A master’s in artificial intelligence from Khoury College combines the “three pillars” of AI — technical, applied, and social/ethical — that empower students with what they need to be a meaningful part of the AI workforce. Learn more.
