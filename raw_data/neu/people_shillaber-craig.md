## [How Slope Failures Can Lead to Critical Highway Collapses](https://coe.northeastern.edu/news/how-slope-failures-can-lead-to-critical-highway-collapses/)
CEE Associate Teaching Professor Craig Shillaber says that highway failures like the recently collapsed section of Teton Pass only happen under certain circumstances. These collapses are caused by slope failures, which depend on the stress of loading conditions and the strength of the foundation soil.
