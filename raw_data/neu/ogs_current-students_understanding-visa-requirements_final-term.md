##  My final term is in the summer. What are the rules for enrollment? 
If your final term is in the summer, the rules are the same! You must maintain full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence throughout the duration of your final term. If you qualify for a Final Term RCL, you may enroll in less than a full-time courseload; but you must continue to maintain on-ground presence for the duration of your final summer term.
