## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University D'Amore-McKim School of Business's [Master of Science in Business Analytics](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-business-analytics/?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=msba) is designed to prepare students to lead in a business world driven by Big Data. 
## Make Data-Driven Business Decisions
Students build the skills to know what data to analyze and understand how to leverage that data for strategic decision making. Classwork provides exposure to data mining, statistical and quantitative analysis, multivariate testing, and predictive modeling. Students explore how to build sales, enhance marketing, or strengthen a company's infrastructure.
## Integrate Classroom and Professional Experiences
Through in-class case studies and a capstone project, professors share real company data so that students apply their knowledge to actual business challenges. They gain unique perspectives as they learn from renowned experts who have led through times of rapid change. Through an optional graduate co-op, students translate ideas into action as they complete a project for an organization. 
## Complete the Degree in as Few as 12 Months
Students complete seven courses throughout the first two semesters and an optional career management class developed by the Graduate Career Center advisor. Students may complete their final three courses over the summer term or can extend their studies and complete their program in the fall term. 
Students enroll in this 30-semester-hour master's degree program for full-time study.
