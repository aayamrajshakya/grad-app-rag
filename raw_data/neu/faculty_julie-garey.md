#  JulieGarey
Graduate Program Director for MA in International Affairs; Associate Teaching Professor of Political Science 
Dr. Julie Garey specializes in international relations, US foreign policy and national security, and international organizations. Her courses offer extensive experiential learning opportunities both inside and outside of the classroom. All courses are centered on three objectives: connecting the theoretical and practical; fostering critical thinking, active engagement, and personal and professional growth; and inspiring new generations of citizens, scholars, and leaders.
Professor Garey’s research interests include alliance and coalition warfare, US military strategy, and American foreign policy and national security more broadly. Her recent book, The US Role in NATO’s Survival After the Cold War (Palgrave 2019), examines the role of NATO in post-Cold War military engagements to explain the alliance’s persistence over the past two decades. Ongoing research projects include understanding the relationship between domestic (US) legislative initiatives and US alliance engagement.
In addition to these teaching and research endeavors, Professor Garey serves as the advisor to the award-winning Northeastern International Relations Council (NU IRC), as well as the Northeastern chapter of the United Nations Association (UNA-Northeastern). In this role, she supports students in their expanded commitment to activism and community engagement at the local and state levels, while also maintaining the group’s status as a nationally-recognized Model UN, NATO, and Arab League team.
