####  [ Gather Required Documents ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18000404-4)
Ensure that you have gathered and printed the following important paperwork and pack it in your carry-on luggage for easy access:
  * Entry/visa supporting documents: 
    * Original Form I-20 or DS-2019 (make sure you have signed it in the appropriate spot)
    * A valid F-1/J-1 visa stamp (in your passport)
    * Passport, valid for at least six months into the future from the date of your arrival
  * You must also travel with: 
    * Any previously issued I-20s/DS-2019s
    * Acceptance Letter from Northeastern University
    * Proof of SEVIS Fee Payment [(I-901 Fee Receipt)](https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html)
    * Proof of enrollment: F-1/J-1 students are required to be signed up for a [full-time course-load](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/) every required academic term: 
      * Print-out of your registered full time on-ground course-load for the upcoming academic term or ensure your ability to log into your student hub to show your full-time enrollment status
    * Proof of Funding. **F-1/J-1 students are required to show****proof of funds to study in the States****.** It is recommended that this is the _same proof of funding_ presented at your F-1/J-1 visa interview, which includes, but is not limited to:
      * Documentation that shows you currently have the liquid funds to pay tuition, e.g. bank account records.
      * Documentation that you have paid tuition or are engaged in a payment plan. You can find out information about paying your tuition and billing information at the [Student Financial Services Website](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/billing-payments/payment-methods/). 
      * Other financial documentation that shows that you can support your living expenses as a full-time student.


####  [ Research possible restrictions for the duration of your travel ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18000404-5)
  * Determine what is needed for you to comply with the relevant regulations for your travel (e.g. departure, connections, customs) according to your citizenship(s) and immigration documentation at each checkpoint.
  * Be aware of the specific exit requirements from your point of origin and the entry requirements at any transit points, as well as the point of entry in the U.S.
  * Adhere to airlines’ COVID-19 safety requirements (if there are any).
  * If in doubt about any information, contact the relevant immigration or government authority of the countries of the travel.


##  Arriving at a U.S. Port of Entry 
###  Please do not use NEXUS or Global Entry, or an automated passport kiosk, to enter the U.S. You must always speak with a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Officer and present your passport and Forms I-20/DS-2019 in order to be admitted to the U.S. F/J student status. 
####  [ Primary Inspection ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18053759-1)
When you arrive at the U.S. Port of Entry, you will first go through Primary Inspection. Make sure to notify someone that you have arrived at the airport or land border before you go through immigration control.
If you are arriving at an airport, proceed to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for inspection. If you are arriving at a land border via car or train, stop and physically walk into the CBP buildings at the Port of Entry.
  * Customs & Border Protection (CBP) will conduct an inspection to determine if you are eligible to enter the U.S. As such, be prepared to present the documentation that you provided at the visa interview. They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed.
  * Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa. 
  * Remember that an F-1/J-1 visa is a travel document that allows you to request entry/admission into the U.S. as an international student. CBP has final authority to grant or deny entry and may conduct a full review of your documentation showing full-time enrollment and financial ability tostudy in the U.S.
  * For more information about CBP Immigration Inspection, visit their website about [clearing customs](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/clearing-customs). 
  * There are many items that cannot be brought into the U.S. or that need to be declared upon entry. Please check out the [Customs and Border Protection Website](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/international-visitors/know-before-you-visit) for more information.
  * You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status.


Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status.
Many U.S. airports have discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your [I-94 record](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home) (Scroll down to read  _Check Your I-94 Record_ for more information).
If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer. Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area. 
If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection.
####  [ Secondary Inspection ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18053759-2)
Secondary Inspection (also called Deferred Inspection) allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry. Should you need further assistance at the Port of Entry, please remember that Northeastern University can be your main point of contact. 
The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status. If additional information regarding your F-1 or J-1 status is needed, please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official (DSO) for F-1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) for J-1 visa holders, using the following contact information: 
  * **Global Safety Operations Center (GSOC) – Available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week:**
    * +1 617 373 5000
    * [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)
    * This office is open even outside of normal business hours.
    * This office can best support you when you have [registered your travel](https://provost.northeastern.edu/international-travel/travel-guidance/travel-registry/) in advance so that they can easily access your travel details.


  * **Office of Global Services – Available Monday – Friday, 8:30am – 4:30pm EST**
    * [+1.617.373.2310](tel:16173732310)


Most importantly, ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties. More information on Secondary Inspection can be found [here](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/what-is-secondary-inspection).
####  [ Social Media and Electronic Device Searches at a U.S. Port of Entry ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18053759-3)
When entering the U.S., Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have the authority to inspect travelers’ electronic devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops. These inspections may include viewing content stored on the device, including social media apps and messages. CBP may conduct searches without a warrant, and refusal to comply may affect your ability to enter the U.S. For details, see [CBP’s policy on electronic device searches](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices). You may also review the following resource from AILA: “Electronic Device Searches at U.S. Ports of Entry”: What You Need to Know”.
##  Emergency Assistance 
###  We recommending saving these phone numbers on your phone in advance! 
If you need emergency assistance while traveling, please call one of the following numbers: 
  * If you are at a U.S. Port of Entry (e.g. airport): +1-617-373-2121 
  * If you are departing for your Northeastern campus within 24 hours or are already in transit: +1-857-214-5332


##  Check your I-94 Record 
The I-94 is an admission record that contains information about your most recent entry to the U.S. It is issued to all international travelers who enters the U.S. (with the exceptions of those who are part of a visa waiver program), and is updated with each entry you make. It contains your basic biographical information, as well as information about your visa status and how long you are allowed to remain in the U.S. 
Once you have successfully cleared inspection and entered the US, you should retrieve your I-94 as soon as possible. You should save a copy of your I-94 record each time you enter the U.S., as the I-94 is the only official evidence of your entry into the U.S.
Please review your I-94 record for accuracy. Two fields you may be unfamiliar with are “Class of Admission” and “Admit Until Date.” These fields should be filled out as follows:
  * **Class of Admission:** matches what is listed on your visa stamp
  * **Admit Until Date:** D/S (This stands for “Duration of Status”)


Visa status other than F-1/J-1 must be corrected immediately (B-1/B-2, WT, or WB status does not permit full-time study in the U.S.)
Arriving by Plane
  * If you arrive by plane[print the most recent I-94](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home) after each entry into the U.S. 
    * Your I-94 should be marked with your visa type (F-1 or J-1) and an “admit until date” (Duration of Status).
    * If there is an error on your I-94, [please see how to correct your I-94](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/obtaining-i-94/).


Arriving via Land Border
  * If you arrive via a Land Border, CBP issues a Form I-94 only upon payment of a fee (currently $6 USD, which will increase to $30 USD on September 30, 2025)
  * In order to enter the U.S. in F or J student status, you have two options to seek entry to the U.S.: 
    1. Stop and physically walk into the CBP buildings at the Port of Entry, present yourself and your documents (Passport and Form I-20 or DS-2019) to a CBP Officer, and pay the fee to receive your I-94; OR
    2. Pre-Pay and apply for a provisional I-94 online ([Apply for I-94](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi94.cbp.dhs.gov%2Fpayment%2Fdocument-apply&data=05%7C02%7Cr.elliott%40northeastern.edu%7C10808c5ee7a64c24b15b08ddecb0671c%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638926964571142954%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=judD3yDEep%2FY6Xx%2BGsGGkCOQ8OxYgv0REWA7JqpqAHk%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/payment/document-apply. Click or tap if you trust this link.")) or via the CBP OneTM mobile application **up to seven days in advance of your arrival at the Port of Entry.**
       * To receive your I-94, stop and physically walk into the CBP buildings;
       * Submit your biometrics (if required) and complete an interview;
       * Present the documents you entered into the application;
       * Show evidence of your residence, employment and/or travel plans, if asked by the CBP officer;
       * If you do not appear within seven days or are not issued an I-94 for any reason, there are no refunds


Please do not use NEXUS or Global Entry, or an automated passport kiosk, to enter the U.S. 
You must always speak with a Customs and Border Protection Officer and present your passport and Forms I-20/DS-2019 in order to be admitted to the U.S. in the proper F-1/J-1 student status.
If anything looks incorrect on your I-94 record, please visit [this page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/getting-started/obtaining-i-94/) for more information on how to request a correction.
##  Form I-515 or I-515A 
The CBP officer may issue you a Form I-515A if you are missing paperwork, or if they are not able to verify your status. This form allows you temporary entrance into the US for up to 30 days, during which time you must collect and submit the necessary evidence to the government to be able to remain in the US for the duration of your F-1 or J-1 status.
If you receive a Form I-515A, the Office of Global Services (OGS) is happy to provide guidance with your response to the government. Please complete the [Request to Comply with I-515A](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/request-to-comply-with-i-515a/) e-form to notify us so that we may best assist.
Note that an I-515A should not have any negative impact on your status as long as you respond in a timely manner. More information on the form I-515A can be found here.
##  Traveling to Campus from the Airport 
####  [ Public Transportation ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18174846-1)
Depending on your final destination, public transportation can be a great way to get around your new city! Make sure to look up in advance directions to get from the airport to your destination. Many areas have a transportation app you can download before you arrive.
####  [ Ride-Share Apps (such as Uber or Lyft) ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/arriving-in-the-u-s-2/#collapse-18174846-2)
  * Download the app before you travel. You can log onto wifi at the airport to use the app and communicate with your driver.
  * Some airports, such as Boston-Logan, have a designated Ride App pick-up area. After collecting your luggage from baggage claim, follow signs and head to the appropriate spot before ordered the ride.
  * Always check that the license plate of the car matches the information in the app to make sure you are getting into the correct car.


##  Traveling to Northeastern for Commencement 
International students, who graduated in a previous academic term, but who want to participate in graduate ceremonies at a later date (for example, a student who graduates at the end of the fall academic term wants to participate in graduation ceremonies at the end of the spring academic term), will have a Completed SEVIS record if they did not apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) or continue in a new academic program. This means that your F-1/J-1 visa and I-20/DS-2019 are no longer valid for entry to the U.S. (even if they have a future end date) as you are no longer enrolled in a program of study.
  * **Do not request a travel signature** since you are no longer eligible for this benefit. 
  * **Utilize alternate visas for travel** to the U.S. such as a [Visitor Visa](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html) or the [Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html) if you are a citizen of a participating country.
