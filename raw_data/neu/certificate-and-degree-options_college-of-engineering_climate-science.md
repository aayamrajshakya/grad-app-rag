## Total Semester Hours Required: 36
The Civil and Environmental Engineering Department encourages students pursuing a GIEL certificate along with an MS in Climate Science and Engineering to complete their MS coursework requirements in their first year and their GIEL certificate requirements in their second year. Students who prefer to complete their GIEL certificate requirements in their first year are asked to speak with their MS degree adviser beforehand.
Guidance for students pursuing the MS in Climate Science and Engineering with a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
