#  Students Studying in The United States 
F-1 students may apply to United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT) work authorization, which helps them apply their classroom learning to the real-world. 
###  Changes to Paper Filing Payment Options Starting October 28, 2025 
Effective October 28th, 2025, USCIS is no longer accepting personal checks, money orders, or bank checks as payment for paper I-765 application fees. Please refer to the “Application Process” section below for updated fee payment instructions. 
##  What is OPT? 
Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT) is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A Post-OPT application first requires an OPT recommendation on a student’s Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD).
##  Eligibility 
Students may apply for a maximum of 12-months of Post-Completion OPT upon completion of each higher degree level. Only one Post-Completion OPT application is allowed per academic degree level (i.e. Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).
You may apply for Post-Completion OPT only if all of the following criteria have been met:
  * You have maintained a valid F-1 student status
  * You have been enrolled full-time for at least one academic year
  * You have completed fewer than 365 days of full-time Curricular Practical Training (CPT) at the degree level for which you are applying for OPT
  * You have completed all coursework (may be in final stages of thesis/dissertation)
  * You are inside the U.S.


Note
##  Application Timeline 
You may apply to USCIS for Post-Completion OPT work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to your program completion date. Post-OPT applications cannot be submitted to USCIS later than 60 days after the program completion date (i.e. during the 60-day grace period).
OPT Application Timeline
Important reminder about Your Program Completion Date
The program end date on your I-20 is an estimated
For example, if you finish all of your courses in May, but your degree conferral is in August, your I-20 end date will be a May date if you have no registration over the summer.
PhD student Program Completion Dates
Students in the PhD program may choose the date of completion based on any of the following dates:
  * Dissertation defense date, or
  * Dissertation/correction submission date, or
  * End of last registered term


##  Choosing Your Start Date 
If you have not used any Pre-Completion OPT time, you may request up to 12-months of Post-Completion OPT. You must request a start date within the 60-day grace period of your program. You select your own start and end date for OPT (even if you do not yet have a job offer).
Here are some general suggestions to help you make the best decision for your situation:
  * If you have a job offer and your job starts during your 60-day grace period, use the job start date (or earlier) as your requested start of OPT
  * If you have a job offer and it starts after your 60-day grace period, use the latest date possible (59th day of grace period) for your OPT start date


**Reminder** : Students are not eligible to begin working until the Post-OPT has been approved by USCIS, they have received their EAD, and
##  Note for PhD Students 
#### If a PhD student has completed all their coursework but is in the final stages of thesis/dissertation, immigration regulations allow the student to apply for either Pre-Completion OPT or Post-Completion OPT while completing their thesis/dissertation.
In this case, the PhD student and their college need to determine the end date of program completion, and the student’s I-20 will be updated to reflect it as the completion date of the program.
If you choose to apply for Post-Completion OPT while completing thesis/dissertation:
  * You must fulfill the reporting requirements of Post-Completion OPT
  * Days you do not have a job count toward 90 days of unemployment time
  * You cannot request program extension even if your thesis/dissertation is not completed after Post-Completion OPT is expired


###  Notice about Social Security Numbers 
As of April 25, 2025: If you do not already have a Social Security Number (SSN) OGS recommends that you do not attempt to apply for a SSN within your I-765 Application to USCIS for Post-OPT. If you need an SSN, please wait for your Employment Authorization Document (EAD), apply for the SSN online, and make an appointment at the Social Security Administration (SSA).

####  [ Step 5: (Optional) Premium Processing ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/#collapse-09297947-5)
In 2023, USCIS introduced the availability of [Premium Processing](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/how-do-i-request-premium-processing) for F-1 students submitting the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days.
Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS.
Notes from OGS
  * Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process
  * Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time
  * OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may review publicly available social media content in connection with certain applications. This may include applications submitted by F-1 students for benefits such as OPT, STEM OPT Extension or change of status. These reviews are intended to support eligibility verification and national security screening. For more, visit [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism).
Within their review, USCIS will also consider if the applicant has demonstrated “Anti-American” or “Antisemitic” activity. You can review OGS’ [USCIS Policy Changes page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/uscis-policy-changes/) for more information.

If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the [OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/)
Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided.
RFE Review Process
All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on:
  * The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents
  * The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation
  * The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official)
  * The due date of the RFE

Please upload the denial notice to the [OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/ogs-post-completion-opt-central/) A DSO will review the denial notice and advise you on next steps.
####  [ I received my EAD! What should I do next? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/#collapse-09382617-7)
Once you’ve received your EAD and the start date on your EAD arrives, you may begin working. It is important to review and comply with all reporting requirements while on Post-OPT. 
You can [learn more on our OPT Employment Reporting page.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/)
##  Important Reminders 
  * Do not submit an OPT application to USCIS before receiving an OPT recommendation on your I-20
  * USCIS must receive the OPT application within 30 days of date that OPT was recommended by OGS; if the application is not received by USCIS within 30 days of the OPT recommendation, your application will be denied
  * Do not wait for a job offer in order to start the OPT application process
  * Students must [abide by all reporting requirements while on Post-Completion OPT. ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/)


###  Exceeding Unemployment During Post-OPT 
If employment is not updated in the SEVP Portal within 90 days of the start date on your EAD card, or you accrue more than 90 days of unemployment during your Post-OPT period, your SEVIS record may be automatically terminated. It is your responsibility to keep a personal record of all OPT activity. 
##  Responsibilities during Post-OPT 
####  [ Reporting Employment during Post-OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/#collapse-09421850-1)
#### It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the potential employment is related to his/her program of study and to timely report all employment to SEVP. You can [learn more on our OPT Employment Reporting page.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-post-opt/)
####  [ Traveling during Post-OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/#collapse-09421850-2)
Students on Post-Completion OPT are still in F-1 status and must maintain all F-1 eligibility documents in order to travel abroad. In order to re-enter the U.S., the following documents are required:
  * A passport that is valid for 6 months from the date of your return to the U.S.
  * A valid F-1 student visa
  * A valid I-20 with OPT recommendation and a valid travel signature on page 2* 
    * *Travel signatures are valid for 6 months while you are on OPT.


  * A valid EAD
  * Proof of employment (an offer letter can be used) 
    * If you are not currently employed, we do not recommend traveling outside of the U.S. as re-entry to the U.S. is granted at the discretion of Customs and Border Protection (CBP)


Given the information above, travel before an EAD card has been approved and received is not advisable. Note
[Please see OGS’ page on International Travel for more information](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/international-travel/)
####  [ Studying during Post-OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/#collapse-09421850-3)
While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the Post-Completion OPT period, students cannot pursue a new degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on Post-Completion OPT. You should speak with a DSO in OGS to see if your studies would qualify. U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers their SEVIS record to another school.
