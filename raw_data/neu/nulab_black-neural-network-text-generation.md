Warpland 2.0 is a creative writing project interested in exploring the potential for fine-tuned neural network natural language generation for the generation of poetry. There are already several examples of artists using machine learning large language models like GPT2 and GPT3 (GPT: Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) to generate text: from stories to lyrics to poetry to melodies. These models can benefit from a process called “fine-tuning”, in which a specific textual corpus augments the original textual training data for the model. For example, a language model fine-tuned on the corpus of Shakespeare would be more capable of generating Shakespeare-like text. Large language models come with their share of problems: they are trained on heavily biased data, massive amounts of internet text from places like reddit and Twitter. Warpland 2.0 is an attempt at shifting the model’s potential outputs by fine-tuning it on a corpus of the work of Gwendolyn Brooks. One goal is to give the model a context for discussing Black people that is more nuanced and sensitive than the out-of-the-box model. This is part of the larger goal, which is to use the fine-tuned model to generate Brooks-inflected ekphrastic poems in response to the artworks of Kara Walker. 
The first iteration of this network, Warpland 1.0, was created using GPT2. Poems written in collaboration with this network were published in the journal Here. th
