Interdisciplinary approach 
##  Interdisciplinary approach 
Our network science program aims to enhance your understanding of networks arising from the interplay of human behavior, sociotechnical infrastructures, information diffusion, and biological agents — an intrinsically multidisciplinary activity. We partner with colleges across Northeastern University — including the [College of Social Sciences and Humanities](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/), [College of Science](https://cos.northeastern.edu/), [Bouvé College of Health Sciences](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/), and [D’Amore-McKim School of Business](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/) — to prepare you with the deep knowledge, broad perspectives, and research opportunities you need to succeed in the field.
