> When I started my graduate co-op at [Amica](https://www.amica.com/) as an investments intern in equity research, I felt completely prepared from day one. A significant part of my preparation came from my experience with the 360 Huntington Fund at Northeastern. This student-led mutual fund provided me with hands-on exposure to financial modeling, market analysis, and investment decision-making.

At D'Amore-McKim, you can apply to join the management team of the 360 Huntington Fund—a real mutual fund that is part of Northeastern's endowment. You can join as an analyst, where you'll research, analyze, and present investment choices to your peers, or apply for a manager role, where you'll handle mutual fund management tasks like preparing accounting statements, creating asset allocation plans, and monitoring compliance. No matter what your experience level with managing stocks, you'll learn invaluable skills in an environment that no simulated fund exercise can match.
