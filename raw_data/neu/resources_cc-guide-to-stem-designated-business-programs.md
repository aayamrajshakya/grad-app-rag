#  Your essential guide to STEM-designated business programs: Everything you need to know 
Published: April 28, 2025
In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, technical expertise is more valuable than ever. A STEM-designated graduate business program provides the analytical and technical skills needed to excel in AI, data analytics, fintech, and other emerging technologies. These programs prepare business students for global careers by tackling complex challenges and driving innovation. This guide explores the benefits of STEM-designated business degrees and then key considerations when choosing the right STEM program to align with your career goals. 
## What is STEM designation? 
The U.S. government recognizes a STEM-designated program as a curriculum that incorporates science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects. Overseen by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), this designation highlights programs that equip students with technical expertise and analytical skills. 
To qualify, an academic program must dedicate at least half of its coursework to STEM-related subjects, such as data analytics, programming, financial modeling, or emerging technologies. These rigorous programs combine advanced theoretical learning with hands-on experience to help students apply their knowledge in professional settings. 
## Benefits of STEM designation for international students 
For F-1 international students, STEM designation by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) offers an additional benefit. When you complete your program, you may become eligible to apply for [Optional Practical Training (OPT)](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/applying-for-post-completion-opt-f-1/), which, if granted, allows you to work in the United States for up to 12 months. By graduating with a STEM-designated degree, you may be eligible to apply for a [24-month extension of OPT](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/)—for a total of 36 months of temporary employment authorization in the U.S. 
## Is business a STEM field? 
Certain areas of business are considered to be STEM-related. Fields like business analytics, quantitative finance, fintech, and supply chain management often qualify as STEM due to their heavy emphasis on data analysis, mathematical modeling, programming, and emerging technologies. These programs prepare students to solve complex business challenges using quantitative and technological approaches, bridging the gap between business strategy and scientific innovation. 
As industries evolve, graduate business programs adapt to meet employer demands by incorporating more data-driven decision-making, artificial intelligence, and automation into their curricula. This shift reflects the growing need for professionals who can blend business acumen with technical expertise, making [STEM-designated business degrees](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/admissions/faq/international-graduate-students/#stem) an increasingly valuable asset in today's job market. 
Not all business programs are STEM-designated, but the D'Amore-McKim School of Business offers options based on your interests and career goals. For example, as of July 2024, the D'Amore-McKim [MS in Quantitative Finance](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-finance/ms-quantitative-finance/) is STEM-designated due to its focus on financial modeling, risk management, and statistical methods, which provide the analytical and technical skills needed for data-driven finance roles. However, traditional accounting programs generally do not meet STEM criteria. 
## Understanding STEM business programs 
STEM-designated business programs blend analytical rigor with practical business applications, equipping you with the skills to thrive in a data-driven economy. By focusing on quantitative methods, technology management, and advanced analytics, these programs prepare you to tackle modern business challenges with a scientific and strategic approach. 
At academic institutions like D'Amore-McKim, [STEM-designated programs](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/admissions/faq/international-graduate-students/#stem) build strong technological and analytical expertise, enabling you to excel in roles requiring data-driven decision-making and strategic problem-solving. These programs prepare you for leadership in emerging industries and enhance your ability to create innovative solutions backed by data and technology. 
## Why experiential learning matters: Bridging theory and practice
Experience-powered learning is crucial because it bridges the gap between theory and practice, preparing you for real-world challenges. At D'Amore-McKim, experiential learning isn't just an add-on; it's a core part of the curriculum. This approach ensures that you gain practical experience alongside your academic studies. There are numerous ways for you to engage in this valuable learning, making it an integral part of your educational journey.
