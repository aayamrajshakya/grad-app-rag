## Background
Questions of online safety, regardless of the definition of “online safety” in play, often turn to questions of responsibility.  
  
As new regulation and new systems are developed, and as users increasingly integrate such systems into their lives, it is crucial that we have frameworks for understanding where the responsibility for online safety should lie.  technical literacy and user responsibility,  
  
In this first project in a series, we will build on existing work on folk theorization and tech literacy by matching it with expert understanding from other perspectives in the system (e.g., technical, privacy, legal/policy, accessibility, and media/misinformation experts). By synthesizing existing work on technical literacy with the next expert perspectives, we will generate a framework for better understanding and negotiating responsibility in the overall user/system relationship that accounts for the needs and practical circumstances of all stakeholders, not just users.
## Project Description
