# #Hashtag Activism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice
The book cover for #Hashtag Activism: Networks of Race and Gender Justice, out now with MIT Press.
_Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant._
Through a unique combination of network analytics and critical readings of tweet texts, #HashtagActivism: Networked Counterpublics in the Digital Age examines how and why Twitter hashtags have become an important platform for historically disenfranchised populations to advance counter-narratives and advocate for social change. We contend that members of these marginalized groups, in the tradition of counterpublics, are using Twitter hashtags to build diverse networks of dissent and shape the cultural and political knowledge fundamental to contemporary identity-based social movements.
