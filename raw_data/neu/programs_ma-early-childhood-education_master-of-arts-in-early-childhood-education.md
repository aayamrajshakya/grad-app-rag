Curriculum details and learning model 
This 42-credit, two-year program’s equity-centered approach to praxis advances social justice and increases access and opportunity for all children.
Most courses in the MA in Early Childhood Education program meet CCTC standards, utilizing a strengths-based approach, which teaches students to approach early childhood with an appreciation of the diverse capabilities and resources children and families offer. The MA in Early Childhood Education program focuses on social justice and equity, centering on a disability studies approach. Students examine how societal systems set limitations based on “othered” identities, and how their instruction, interaction, and advocacy can create equitable and accessible learning opportunities. The degree is conferred by Mills College at Northeastern University, and the teaching credentials are presented by CCTC.
The Early Child Education (ECE) department maintains the belief that coursework and fieldwork must be integrated. Therefore, courses have assignments requiring engagement in educational settings, and students will be placed in experiential learning/educational fieldwork every semester of the two-year program. During a student’s first year, they will be placed at the Mills College Children’s School, where they are closely mentored by experienced and knowledgeable early childhood professionals. Students participate in weekly reflective circles with team members, where they discuss instructional decisions and interventions, receive feedback, and identify the next steps for supporting children and families. During the second year, student teaching will take place in an early intervention setting and a preschool-kindergarten setting.
In their field placements, students have an opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of effective early intervention and preschool special education. These experiential learning experiences total more than 900 hours, far exceeding the 600 hours of fieldwork required by the CCTC. Throughout the course sequence of the MA in Early Childhood Education program, students will compile a digital portfolio, including course assignments, such as reflection pieces, presentations, and papers. The portfolio will provide us with assessment evidence of varied experiences, depth of knowledge, and critical reflection around instruction gained during the program. A description of [clinical experiences is available here](https://sites.google.com/northeastern.edu/millsatnortheasternsoe/stage-iv-initial-program-approval/ecse-program-standards-ps/es-ps-3?authuser=0).
