2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’ [Master of Science in Accounting/Master of Business Administration](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-accounting-mba/) combined-degree program puts nonaccounting majors on an accelerated path toward a successful career in accounting. 
## Cultivate Deep Accounting Knowledge and Fundamental Business Skills
This 15-month curriculum is constructed in partnership with some of the leading accounting firms. Students will build knowledge in both accounting and business, including a four-course concentration in business analytics.
## Analytics Concentration
Students will develop their analytical skills through an MBA concentration in analytics. Through four courses students use data to support business decision making and create a measurable improvement on organizational performance.
## Integrate Classroom and Professional Experiences
Students will have opportunities to obtain real-world experiences that help them gain a fresh perspective while using relevant skills. They apply their knowledge to actual business challenges through class projects. Starting in January, students leverage their newly acquired skills in a three-month paid corporate residency at a Big 4 or another top accounting firm. Far removed from the typical internship, students work full-time as an associate and have significant responsibilities to deliver on organizational goals.
Students may enroll in this 68-semester-hour master's degree program for full-time study.
