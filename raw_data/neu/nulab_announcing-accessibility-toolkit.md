# Announcing: Accessibility Toolkit
The Digital Integration Teaching Initiative (DITI) team is pleased to announce that we have developed a new resource for community members, students, and faculty interested in developing accessible teaching materials. As part of our commitment to supporting best practices in classroom instruction, the DITI now offers an Accessibility Toolkit comprising the [DITI Guide to Inclusive Pedagogy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VSIffGGS9Qt25u3u4Y1pFiPVG_BxfrufjeDEz9IBSU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9brjphxlpup4) and the [DITI Guide to Creating Accessible Digital Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKlgNS9NTKRWrbDGODLFMH2X9oJaUaon43I_vS8tFfU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dkkjufor61b2). To access this new resource, please visit our [Teaching Resources page](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/teaching-resources/) and look under “Pedagogical Resources.”
The [DITI Guide to Inclusive Pedagogy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_VSIffGGS9Qt25u3u4Y1pFiPVG_BxfrufjeDEz9IBSU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9brjphxlpup4), developed by Avery Blankenship, includes an overview of approaches to accessible pedagogy and guidelines to follow in the classroom. The [DITI Guide to Creating Accessible Digital Content](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKlgNS9NTKRWrbDGODLFMH2X9oJaUaon43I_vS8tFfU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.dkkjufor61b2) compiles a collection of working documents developed by the DITI to foster accessible teaching practices. It includes a summary checklist, a guide to making accessible handouts, a guide to making accessible slides, and a DEIB pre-visit refresher on inclusive teaching.
This toolkit joins the growing collection of DITI resources that can be used by anybody at any time, such as our [resources for asynchronous teaching and learning](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/resources-for-asynchronous-teaching-and-learning/), our general [teaching resources](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/teaching-resources/) collection, our [sample course modules](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/modules/samples/), and our [available DITI tools](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/modules/available-diti-tools/) page. We encourage the adaptation and reuse of these resources. We hope that teachers, students, and members of the community will find this toolkit useful. Please [contact the DITI team](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/contact/) with any questions or feedback.
