#  Students Studying in The United States 
While it is your responsibility to maintain your status, the Office of Global Services is here to help guide you through the complexities of the U.S. government regulations and procedures. 
##  Maintaining Lawful F-1/J-1 Status 
As an F-1 or J-1 student, you must meet certain obligations in order tomaintainlawful nonimmigrant status. Maintaining status is necessary in order to retain eligibility for the benefits of F-1 or J-1 status, such as employment authorization and program extension, and can be crucial to a successful application for a change or adjustment of nonimmigrant status in the future. Failure to maintain your nonimmigrant status can result in serious problems with immigration and could lead to deportation from the U.S.
**F-1 Students****: Please also review the information provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on the**[**Study in the States website**](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/students/maintaining-status)**regarding maintaining F-1 status.**
**Please be sure to click each section and item below and carefully read the information. Contact OGS if you have questions about these requirements.**
###  Consequences of not Maintaining Your Status 
If you fail to maintain your F-1/J-1 status, your legal permission to remain in the U.S., utilize the F-1 or J-1 status benefits, such as practical training and employment, as well as your ability to return to the U.S. in the future, may be impacted. This also applies to your accompanying F-2/J-2 dependents' status. If you think you may have violated your visa status, please immediately contact OGS, who will schedule an appointment with you to discuss your situation and your options. The options for regaining F-1 status after a status violation are outlined on the OGS website. 
##  F-1 and J-1 Student General Requirements

####  [ Immediately open and carefully read any emails you receive from [email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-1)
  * Our office will send any important information related to your F-1/J-1 status to your **Northeastern email address**. 
  * Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS.
  * Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status.


####  [ Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-2)
  * F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address **within 10 days of the change**.
  * OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document.
  * Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account.
  * Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS.


####  [ Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.) ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-3)
  * OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents.
  * Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future:
    * to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations
    * for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State


  * For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document.
  * **Students on the STEM OPT Extension** : please keep copies of all fully executed Forms I-983 that you complete with your STEM employers (including all 12-month and final evaluations on Page 5).
  * **J-1 students** : please print and sign each digitally-signed DS-2019 that is issued to you. We recommend you keep copies of all DS-2019s issued to you either as paper documents or digitally-signed documents.


####  [ Report Changes to Your Immigration Status ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-4)
  * Report any changes in your non-immigrant status from F-1/J-1 to any other status to OGS.
    * You can report a change to becoming a permanent resident (green card holder) [using this e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/switching-to-permanent-residency/).
    * If your non-immigrant status changes to H-1B, you can submit the [H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/cap-gap-i-20-request/).

  * All international students with F-1 or J-1 status must complete the mandatory Immigration Clearance at the start of each new program of study. This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called “online immigration clearance.” Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination.
  * Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the [OGS website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/new-students/arrival/online-immigration-clearance/).


####  [ Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-7)
  * Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad.
  * Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return.
  * Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. **Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated**. 
    * Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date.
    * In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the “Change of Degree Level” section below)
    * Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated, or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S.


####  [ Understand Your “Grace Period” After Program Completion ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61523131-8)
F-1 and J-1 students enter what is called a “grace period” after they have completed their degree programs. This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. _If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion._
During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date.

####  [ Maintain Health Insurance Coverage ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61844509-2)
U.S. government regulations [22 CFR § 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements:
  * Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness
  * Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000
  * Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000
  * A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness
  * Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period
  * Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs)

  * Weiss Research, Inc. rating of ‘‘B+’’ or above
  * Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of ‘‘A-’’ or above
  * Moody’s Investor Services rating of ‘‘A3’’ or above.
  * Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor


If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers **all** of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements.
The [Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP)](http://www.northeastern.edu/nushp/#_ga=2.70538835.2117150924.1678738923-1413005394.1661188258) meets the Department of State requirements.
If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including [this plan](https://www.gallagherstudent.com/students/student-home.php?idField=1366) offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk.
**Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record.**
####  [ Matriculation & Changing Degree Level ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61844509-3)
J-1 degree-seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called “Matriculation.” This is only permissible to move to ah higher degree level, for example – Bachelor‘s to Master’s or Master’s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 non-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category.
####  [ Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61844509-4)
Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject.
Please [read the OGS website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/exchange-visitor-program/j-1-visiting-students/212e-two-year-home-residency-requirement-for-j-1-visiting-students/) for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions.
####  [ 12- and 24-Month Bars ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/guidelines-on-maintaining-status/#collapse-61844509-5)
The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar.
If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows).
Please [review the OGS website](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/exchange-visitor-program/j-1-scholars/12-and-24-month-bars-for-j-1-scholars/) for more information about the bars.
##  F-1 and J-1 Student Employment Requirements 
###  Employment is a benefit of F-1/J-1 status that has specific requirements and restrictions.
