#  N. FadekeCastor
Associate Professor of Religion and Africana Studies 
N. Fadeke Castor (she/they) is a Black Feminist ethnographer and African diaspora studies scholar, with research and teaching interests in religion, race, performance and the intersectional politics of decolonization. As a Yorùbá Ifá initiate of Trinidadian heritage they are inspired by African spiritual engagements with Black liberation imaginaries and the Black radical tradition. She is the author of [Spiritual Citizenship: Transnational Pathways from Black Power to Ifá in Trinidad](https://www.dukeupress.edu/spiritual-citizenship/) (Duke University Press, 2017; Clifford Geertz Prize, 2018), which centered the Ifá/Orisha religion in the Black radical tradition and Trinidad’s Black Power revolution to illuminate practices and performances of decolonization in the post-colonial Caribbean. Their writings can be found in [Cultural Anthropology](https://culanth.org/fieldsights/shifting-multicultural-citizenship-trinidad-orisha-opens-the-road-supplemental-material), [Fieldwork in Religion](https://doi.org/10.1558/firn.22605), [Tarka](https://www.tarkajournal.com/home/spiritual-citizenship), and [The Black Scholar](https://doi.org/10.1080/00064246.2022.2079065). Her current research focuses on an exploration of the spiritual ontologies and epistemologies of Black spiritual praxis as shifting our centers of being and ways of knowing towards collective care, healing, and social transformation. As part of this larger project they are building [Digital Ancestral Altars: Remembrances of Trinidad Ifá/Orisha Elders](https://crossroads.princeton.edu/people/n-fadeke-castor-0) (funded by a Community Stories grant from [The Crossroads Project](https://crossroads.princeton.edu/), Princeton University), a digital multi-modal repository and archive, to commemorate Trinidad’s ancestral Ifá/Orisha elders.
