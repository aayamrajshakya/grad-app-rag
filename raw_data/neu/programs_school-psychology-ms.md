## Excel as a school psychologist
School psychologists are behavioral health specialists who conduct psychological, educational and behavioral assessments for the purpose of designing effective interventions, counseling children and parents, consulting with teachers and parents, implementing and evaluating school-wide prevention programs and performing in-service training.
Northeastern University offers a Master of Science (MS) in School Psychology and a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS) in School Psychology. The entire three-year program (M.S. and CAGS) has full approval from the National Association of School Psychologists and the Massachusetts State Department of Education. 
Distinctive features of our program include:
  * Urban and culturally diverse field placements and applied research projects
  * Early childhood emphasis
  * Highly collaborative and student-centered faculty
  * Strong and supportive student cohort groups


Our training approach incorporates the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration. Our students learn how to work on teams in delivering services, and how to draw upon the rich resources of professionals from related disciplines.
Our students have a strong professional identity and social conscience. The department has a very active student chapter of the school psychology division of the [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/) (Student Affiliates in School Psychology-SASP). 
This student chapter plans educational workshops, conferences, and social activities. Many of our alumni have assumed leadership roles in state and national organizations. In addition, they consider themselves advocates for the needs of children.

##  School Psychology MS 
## Curriculum
A cornerstone of Northeastern University and our program is practice-oriented education. We train students to become highly skilled scientific practitioners and lifelong learners, who employ the scientific, problem-solving method to evaluate their own practice. 
Real world projects and work experiences are integrated into coursework and fieldwork. Students complete practicum and internship fieldwork requirements in local area schools. The faculty have developed a rich network of collaborative school psychologists who serve as excellent field supervisors. Faculty assist with placing students at school fieldwork sites in and around the Boston Metropolitan area. 
During the third year internship students document their mastery of the training goals through comprehensive case studies.
### Practicum
Students complete 525 hours of field experience in school psychology during the first 2 years, including 75 hours of course-based practicum in the first year and 450 hours (roughly 2 days/week) of field-based practicum in the second year,
During the field-based practicum, students are expected to demonstrate their skills in the following core areas of school psychology:
  * Domain 1: Data-Based Decision Making 
  * Domain 2: Consultation and Collaboration 
  * Domain 3: Academic Interventions and Instructional Supports 
  * Domain 4: Mental and Behavioral Health Services and Interventions 
  * Domain 5: School-Wide Practices to Promote Learning 
  * Domain 6: Services to Promote Safe and Supportive Schools 
  * Domain 8: Equitable Practices for Diverse Student Populations 
  * Domain 9: Research and Evidence-Based Practice 
  * Domain 10: Legal, Ethical, and Professional Practice 


### Internship
In accordance with the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) and Massachusetts Department of Education (DOE) requirements for certification/licensure in school psychology, students are required to attain a minimum of 1200 hours of field experience during their internship in school psychology.
Internship students are enrolled in a seminar course during the internship year. A university supervisor, who is a certified school psychologist, instructs this course. For internship within Massachusetts, the university supervisor maintains contact with the field supervisor through three site visits. At the end of the internship year, the field supervisor and university supervisor determine if the student has progressed adequately in the major competency areas.

The pre-practicum can be completed at the end of the first year of the program or at the beginning of the second year. The purpose of the pre-practicum is for students to gain observational experiences and to learn about the school ecology.
Practicum
During the field-based practicum, students are expected to demonstrate their skills in the following core areas of school psychology:

  * Domain 10: Legal, Ethical, and Professional Practice


In regard to the assessment requirements, students should complete at least two comprehensive psycho-educational assessments, and their total number of assessments should be between a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 10. The comprehensive assessments should include multiple reliable and valid methods that assess multiple domains of functioning, and the choice of instruments should be derived from the presenting concerns/referral questions. More detailed guidance can be found in the portfolio guidelines.

Practicum students are enrolled in a seminar course during the practicum year. A university supervisor, who is a certified school psychologist, instructs this course. The university supervisor maintains contact with the field supervisor through two site visits and phone calls when necessary. At the end of the practicum year, the field supervisor and university supervisor determine if the student has progressed adequately in core areas and is ready for internship.
### Benefits for Supervisors
In recognition of the valuable guidance and supervision students receive from field-based supervisors, the Bouvé College of Health Sciences at Northeastern University offers a host of benefits to field-based supervisors. A list of these benefits can be provide upon request.

## Experiential Learning and Clinical Opportunities
A cornerstone of Northeastern University and our program is practice-oriented education. We train students to become highly skilled scientific practitioners and lifelong learners, who employ the scientific, problem-solving method to evaluate their own practice. 
Real world projects and work experiences are integrated into coursework and fieldwork. Students complete practicum and internship fieldwork requirements in local area schools.

### Project Integrate
[Project INTEGRATE](https://projectintegrate.sites.northeastern.edu/) is a collaborative project between Northeastern’s School Psychology and Applied Behavior Analysis programs that is funded through a grant from the U.S. Department of Education. The aim of the project is to train interdisciplinary scholars from underrepresented, culturally, and linguistically diverse backgrounds to effectively address high-intensity, co-existing academic and behavioral needs of children with disabilities in school settings using a data-based individualization framework.

## Frequently
### What is the employment landscape like for your program graduates?
In general the job market is extremely positive for school psychologists. Our alumni receive job offers soon after graduation and oftentimes they have multiple job offers to choose from in the summer after graduation.
Opportunities to develop expertise in Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or Early Intervention (see concentration information below), opportunities to engage in school psychology research and scholarship by co-presenting with faculty at conferences and co-authoring articles, and leadership opportunities available through Northeastern’s local Student Affiliates in School Psychology (SASP) chapter help our students’ resumes “stand out from the crowd” when they are applying for jobs. Our program has a 100% pass rate on the School Psychology Praxis Exam.
* * *
### Do I have to complete all of the prerequisite undergraduate courses before applying to the program?
Applicants can be admitted to the program conditionally, pending completion of the prerequisite courses. We expect conditionally accepted applicants to pass all of the prerequisite courses prior to beginning the program. The program is flexible about how incoming students meet the prerequisite requirement. Courses can be taken through an online course offered at an accredited university or at a community college if that is more convenient and affordable.

### How much is tuition and is financial aid available?
Typically there are a small number of Dean’s Scholarships for MS/CAGS students, which are awarded based on  
merit. No additional application is needed to be considered for these awards.
