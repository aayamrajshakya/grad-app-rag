## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
  * ###  [African-American Novel](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL 7244
Surveys major nineteenth- or twentieth-century African-American novelists, such as Francis Harper, Charles Chestnutt, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Toni Morrison, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, and Ishmael Reed. 
  * ### American Women Writers & Race
#### WMNS/ENGL/AFAM 2455
Surveys the diversity of American women’s writing to ask what it means to describe writers as disparate as Phillis Wheatley, Edith Wharton, Toni Morrison, and Alison Bechdel as part of the same “tradition.” With attention to all genres of American women’s writing, introduces issues of genre and gender; literary identification; canons; the politics of recuperation; silence and masquerade; gender and sexuality; intersectionality; sexual and literary politics, compulsory heterosexuality, and more. 
  * ###  [Theorizing Gender & Sexuality](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/wmns/)
#### WMNS 6100
This interdisciplinary course offers debates around sex, gender, sexuality, and the body that push beyond binary models reliant on a simple “nature/culture” distinction. Focuses on dynamic and variable aspects of sexuality, sex, and gender within and across cultures, representational forms, and historical periods, analyzing the circumstances in which they undergo significant challenge or transformation. Uses particular paradigmatic “case studies” to push hard at the boundaries of sex and gender as they circulate in specific discourses of feminism, queer theory, and poststructuralism; ethnic studies; critical race theory; and cultural studies. 


### [The African-American Novel ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/engl/)
#### ENGL/AFAM/WMNS 3663
Studies the African-American novelist’s place in the history of American fiction. Focuses on Chesnutt, Toomer, Wright, Ellison, and contemporary novelists and on their different perceptions of the African-American experience in America. ENGL 3663 and AFAM 3663 are cross-listed.
