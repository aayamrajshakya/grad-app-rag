## Overview
The Graduate Certificate in Digital Platforms for Service Innovation provides students with foundational knowledge on the ecosystems around digital platforms and their impact on the distribution of economic opportunities in society. Digital platforms for providing services, such as Uber and AirBnB, are online tools that connect customers with service providers smoothly, enhancing operations by simplifying communications, transactions, and delivery. They incorporate the latest in artificial intelligence and technical innovations. This interdisciplinary program has tracks for students with engineering and computer sciences backgrounds, and social sciences and business backgrounds. It can be taken simultaneously with a master’s degree at Northeastern, where integrated coursework may be able to be applied to both the MS and certificate requirements, or it can be taken separately.

## Program Goals
Career Outlook
The increasing digitization of the economy and resulting growth of digital platforms have dramatically altered how individuals, organizations, and governments exchange and allocate resources. According to McKinsey Research, by 2029 digital platforms will mediate over 30%, or $60 trillion, in global economic activity. Additionally, global spending on AI software will surge from $124 billion in 2022 to $297 billion in 2027, according to Gartner. These platforms have disrupted multiple industries, upended labor economics and practices, and fundamentally transformed resource management, asset allocation and market design.
> “This program not only encourages interdisciplinary collaboration but actively rewards it. Seeing how my peers interpret problems differently challenges my assumptions, enriches my understanding, and ultimately strengthens our work.” Josh Rosen, PhD student 
> “The combination of technical, social, and economic perspectives has helped me think in new ways and collaborate with peers from different backgrounds. It’s more than just research—it provides real-world knowledge that I can apply in many fields.” Mahnaz Vahdat, PhD, Interdisciplinary Engineering
