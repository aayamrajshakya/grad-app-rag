Letters of recommendation are a crucial part of any grad school application. They help admissions officers see beyond test scores and connect the dots about who you are and why you will be a strong fit for their program. But how can you ensure that the letter submitted on your behalf will impress admissions and help you stand out from the crowd? 
Read on to explore some of the best tips for requesting a graduate school recommendation letter.
## How to ask for a grad school recommendation letter
Requesting a letter of recommendation may seem daunting, considering how big of an impact it could have on your future. To navigate the process successfully, follow the steps below. 
### 1. Understand the application requirements.
For most graduate programs, you’ll need two or three letters of recommendation. Be sure to check the application guidelines for each graduate program you’re applying to. In addition, specific programs will stipulate if your letters of recommendation should be from an academic or professional reference, which might include your manager or colleagues. Take the time to understand precisely what each program is looking for before reaching out to recommenders.
Additionally, it can be helpful to review the degree program website and talk with an admissions officer to get a clear sense of the program requirements and what attributes or academic skills are most valued within the program. You can later share these insights with those writing your recommendations. 
### 2. Choose your recommenders carefully.
After exploring the guidelines for letters of recommendation for your particular program, it’s important to review who you might consider asking to attest on your behalf. You may consider requesting a letter from a professor, faculty member, researcher, employer, mentor, or even a peer with whom you have a positive relationship.
What matters most is that you engage someone who: 
  * You’ve worked with directly for a meaningful amount of time.
  * Can speak to your specific strengths.
  * Will describe how these strengths will serve you well in the graduate program.


“You don’t just want a letter that _says_ you’re a hard worker, but one that _demonstrates_[the] ways that you are a hard worker,” says Mallory Leiendecker,ssociate director of enrollment at [Northeastern University](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/). “Admissions officers want to know how you would benefit their program, so you want letters that will help bring that to life.”
### 3. Frame your request.
How you present your request for a letter is just as important as who you ask. Carefully consider your plan and be sure to “show genuine appreciation to recommenders for helping you,” Leiendecker says. 
Be thoughtful in your approach
Writing a letter of recommendation is a big favor, so be sure that you approach asking from a respectful, formal, and grateful place. 
One way to bridge this conversation is by asking for a brief meeting with them. You can walk them through how much you value your experiences working with them, how their input will be significant to your application, and what you hope to achieve from the graduate program.
What’s more, be sure to clearly state in this conversation why you chose _them_ specifically to write a letter for you. Perhaps they helped you learn essential skills, or they inspired you to pursue a particular area of study. No matter the reason, they are more likely to feel connected to your request if they know there’s been a lot of thought and time behind your decision.
If possible, try to hold this conversation in person. If you can’t, aim for a video or phone call instead. Although email is efficient, it often leaves room for interpretation in messages. With an ask as crucial as this, your contact must know how important this is to you and how thankful you are for their consideration.
Provide an easy “out” for recommenders
Receiving lukewarm letters of recommendation can actually do more harm than good. To avoid this problem, consider framing your request to potential recommenders in a way that allows them to politely decline if they don’t feel their insight will be impactful. Ask if they would feel “comfortable writing you a letter of recommendation that will highlight your particular strengths.” That way, if they aren’t likely to write a glowing recommendation, they have an opportunity to bow out gracefully. 
If they do deny your request at this stage, consider it a gift; you will still have an opportunity to find someone else who will write an impactful letter on your behalf, and you can avoid including a generic recommendation in your application.
Be considerate of their time
Professors and other professionals receive countless requests for letters of recommendation, so it’s best to give your contact plenty of lead time to write yours. Generally, it’s a good idea to ask for recommendations at least one month or more in advance of the application due date. Leiendecker explains that “the worst thing you can do is wait until a few days before the deadline on something that’s this important.”
If possible, you may also want to build in some buffer time to your request and ask them to provide the letter a week or two before the actual deadline. That way, even if your recommender faces an unexpected obstacle or delay, you can still ensure your materials are submitted on time.
### 4. Make the request.
To help ensure that your request gets completed on time and to your standards, be sure to provide your recommenders with everything they may need to write a letter on your behalf. 
Set the stage
Set the stage for recommenders by explaining why you selected this particular graduate program and why you feel you’re a good fit. Gently guide recommenders to ensure each letter of recommendation:
  1. Describes how the recommender knows you and your work.
  2. Outlines how and why they anticipate you will be successful in the program.
  3. Provides specific examples that illustrate your top attributes.


Providing your recommender with a bulleted list of highlights relating your experience to the program’s requirements can be incredibly helpful as they work to tie what they know about you and your work ethic to the specifics of this program.
“If you provide recommenders a format for the letter and points to think about, that can help get you a better letter,” Leiendecker says. “Be very clear about what you need from them and what the admissions committee is looking for. A personal letter that connects the program with your work and your professional goals will have the highest value.”
Make it easy for recommenders
Whether you make your initial request in person or in writing, be sure to follow up and provide any relevant information the recommender may need to craft their letter. Depending on the situation, this might include:
  * The university name
  * The college name 
  * The program name
  * [Your application](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/applying-to-graduate-school-tips/)
  * [Your statement of purpose](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-write-a-statement-of-purpose/)
  * Your college transcripts
  * Any additionally required essays or statements
  * Your research work highlights
  * A list of any awards and honors you’ve received
  * [Your resumé](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/how-to-write-a-grad-school-resume/)
  * The letter submission deadline
  * Instructions for submitting the letter
  * Your contact information (so recommenders can reach out to you with any clarifying questions)


Providing these materials up front will remind the reviewer of your most important skills and help add color and context to each letter. 
### 5. Follow up with your recommenders.
It’s understandable to feel a bit shy about following up with recommenders. Still, if done politely and appropriately, this is useful in ensuring letters are written and submitted on time—and that they are the best reflection of you.
Review the letter in advance
If possible, consider politely asking recommenders if they can send you a copy of the letter before they submit it. This way, you’ll know what was written and potentially have more control over the process. If the letter is meandering or doesn’t hit the salient points you’re looking for, there may be an opportunity to tactfully ask if the recommender would mind making a few minor changes before sending in your letter.
Just remember to remain polite, receptive, and grateful for their time and energy throughout the process, and limit requests for edits or rewrites to one or two maximum.
Remember:
Provide respectful reminders
If you haven’t heard from recommenders as you get closer to the application deadline, it’s a good idea to make a polite inquiry several weeks before your application due date. There’s no need to pester them, but it can be helpful to send one gentle reminder confirming that they plan to write a letter and asking if they have any questions or points you can provide some insight on as they work. 
Hearing from you may be the prompt they need to get to work or follow up and ask for further input. The opportunity to answer any follow-up questions may even negate the need to ask for a copy of the letter ahead of time and allow you the opportunity to provide some input or feedback during the writing stage.
### 6. Share your success.
Send a note of gratitude as soon as recommenders write you a letter. “A thank you note goes a long way,” Leiendecker says. “Also, if you get into the program, write to recommenders letting them know and thanking them for their role in your success.”
