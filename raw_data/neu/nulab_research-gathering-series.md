In December 2018, the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Science awarded a Seedling Grant to Northeastern graduate students—in partnership with the Digital Scholarship Group—seeking to connect with other students doing Digital Humanities in Greater Boston. The goals of this series are to foster connections and provide students with resources and opportunities to share their research. During Spring 2019 this group launched with our first event, a Research Potluck, followed by an informal working lunch to discuss organization and resources. After our Spring events, the series evolved into the DH Hub: A Collaborative Community for Graduate Student and Early-Career Researchers and Practitioners
After a successful launch, this program is now being run internally by the NULab and the Digital Scholarship Group. 
Those interested in connecting with other graduate students or early career researchers and practitioners doing DH work in Boston can request to join the DH Hub Slack channel: <https://forms.gle/zR61QoA4zSxU4fWh9>. For more information, email: bos.dh.hub[at]gmail[dot]com.
