# Resources
A Zotero bibliography by student Sam Haas (2019), part of the [DITI's example materials](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/program/diti/student-work/).
This is a regularly updated collection of datasets, tools, articles, code, and tutorials, including materials for research, classwork, coding practice, and teaching. 
## [Datasets](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/data-sets/)
One of the most challenging aspects of digital work can be finding an appropriate, useful dataset. We have compiled datasets that are structured and unstructured, numerical and textual. 
## [Digital Projects](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/digital-projects/)
These resources include digital project development tools for data visualizations, timelines, map-based presentations, 3D modeling, citation management, coding, and backend website development.
## [Text Analysis](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/text-analysis/)
These resources cover topics including programming languages like R and Python, exploratory scripts of word tokenizations and counts, and topic modeling and word embedding models. 
##  [GIS/Visualization](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/gis/)
This page has frameworks and guidelines for designing and creating visualizations and working with geographic data for analysis. 
## [Network Science](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/networks/)
Network science resources include tutorials, datasets, and other useful links for creating network visualizations and performing network analysis. 
## [Teaching Resources](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/research/resources/teaching-resources/)
The latest handouts made for the Digital Integration Teaching Initiative’s in-class visits are available for professors and educators to use in their own courses, or for students to learn more about any of the above tools.
