2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering jointly offer an interdisciplinary Master of Science in Data Science. This program is designed to give students a comprehensive framework for reasoning about data. Students engage in extensive coursework intended to develop depth in data collection, storage, retrieval, manipulation, visualization, modeling, and interpretation. Students are also able to choose elective courses from a variety of offerings in Khoury, the College of Engineering, and throughout the campus to explore areas that generate data or specialized data science applications. Successful program graduates are well positioned to attain data scientist and data engineer positions in a fast-growing field or to progress into doctoral degrees in related disciplines.
During the admissions process, applicants take a pretest to determine if the [Master of Science in Data Science](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/computer-information-science/computer-science/data-science-ms-sjo/index.html) or Master of Science in Data Science—Align fits better with their current skill level. In addition, prospective applicants work with recruitment and enrollment coaching teams to select the appropriate program before applying.
The Master of Science in Data Science—Align curriculum is specifically designed to prepare incoming students without any prior programming experience. During the first semester of year one, students are expected to take foundational courses in computer science fundamentals, as well as a course in data structures/discrete mathematics. During their second semester, students will take coursework in programming for data science, as well as linear algebra and probability.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
Students should refer to the course numbering table for [graduate course leveling](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/academic-policies-procedures/records-transcripts/).

## Program Credit/GPA Requirements
40–48 total semester hours required  
Minimum 3.000 GPA required 

1  
    
Students taking electives worth less than 4 SH (i.e., Bouvé courses) should enroll for an accompanying data science project course in the same semester to bring the cumulative SH to 4. In order to earn this additional 1 SH, students are expected to work with faculty to design an additional project in line with the curricular aims of their chosen elective and the data science core learning outcomes.
