Program overview 
##  Lead in finance and business 
Advances in technology are revolutionizing how we create wealth and transact financial business. This rapid change creates a strong demand for leaders with the finance knowledge, business acumen, and interdisciplinary skills to solve complex problems.
The Full-Time MS in Finance/MBA at D’Amore-McKim will prepare you for the evolving future of the finance industry with specialized dual expertise in finance and business-in less time than it would take you to earn two degrees separately.
You’ll develop deep knowledge of core finance and business concepts along with an additional area of specialty to give you a rich background for decision-making. Throughout your program, you’ll have opportunities for transformational experiences that amplify your learning-including Northeastern’s one-of-a-kind corporate residency, where you’ll earn a salary as a valued team member at a leading financial firm.
