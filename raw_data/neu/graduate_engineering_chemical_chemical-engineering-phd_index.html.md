Each student admitted to the PhD program in chemical engineering will initially be designated a. Upon successful completion of the requirements for doctoral candidacy as described below, a student is reclassified as a.After establishing candidacy, a student must complete a dissertation under the direction of a dissertation advisor. All doctoral candidates must also pass a final written and oral examination.
## Doctoral Candidacy for Direct Entry
To qualify for doctoral candidacy, the student must demonstrate mastery of four core courses of chemical engineering (thermodynamics or statistical thermodynamics, kinetics, transport, and mathematics). To become a doctoral candidate, students must maintain a grade-point average of 3.250 or above in the four core courses and have no individual grade below a B– in the four core courses. Mastery of the four core courses must be demonstrated within the first year, unless an extension is granted by the department graduate committee.
In addition, each student must complete 4 semester hours of Research (CHME 9984)
## Doctoral Candidacy for Advanced Entry
To become a doctoral candidate, advanced-entry students who have already completed a graduate degree in chemical engineering or a closely related discipline must petition the graduate committee of the Department of Chemical Engineering and demonstrate that the mastery has been attained through coursework either at Northeastern University or during a previous graduate degree from another institution (typically granted when the student has achieved a grade of at least A– in an equivalent course; an official transcript and relevant course syllabus from the previous degree will be required for verification
The graduate committee may require a student to take or retake any or all of the core courses before achieving doctoral candidacy. Incoming advanced-entry students should form a plan of coursework in consultation with the associate chair for graduate studies and have this approved by the graduate committee. For the core courses taken at Northeastern, students should maintain a GPA of 3.250 or above and have no individual grade below a B–. 
In addition, each student must complete 4 semester hours of Research (CHME 9984)
## Course Requirements
### Direct Entry
A minimum of 32 semester hours of academic coursework, not including any directed study credits,
### Advanced Entry
A minimumnot including any directed study credits,Research (CHME 9984)
### General Requirements
PhD students who have completed the majority of their coursework and not yet reached PhD candidacy should registerResearch (CHME 9986)in a section for which their dissertation research advisor is listed as the instructor in the online registration system. The semester they plan to defend their proposal, they should register for Candidacy Preparation Candidacy Preparation—Doctoral (CHME 8960) and for 4 semester hours ofResearch (CHME 9984).
After obtaining PhD candidacy, students are required to register for Dissertation Term 1 (CHME 9990)Dissertation Term 2 (CHME 9991)Dissertation Continuation (CHME 9996):Dissertation Term 1 (CHME 9990)Dissertation Term 2 (CHME 9991)Dissertation Continuation (CHME 9996)
All students pursuing a doctoral degree must enroll in the department’s Seminar (CHME 7390)
Students will be advised on their courses for the first semester by the associate chair for graduate studies. After the first semester, students will work with their dissertation advisor to determine appropriate courses and course schedule to meet their educational needs and aspirations. Upon consultation with the dissertation advisor, a student may take up to 44 semester hours of course credit without additional financial penalty. Students and dissertation advisors should keep in mind that the university residency requirement requires two semesters of academic studies after becoming a doctoral candidate.
## Language Requirement
There is no foreign language requirement for the PhD degree. However, each candidate must be proficient in technical writing and oral presentation in the English language. The graduate committee may require additional coursework to improve language proficiency, if necessary.
## Residence Requirement
A student satisfies the residence requirement by completing one academic year of full-time graduate studies during two consecutive academic semesters after qualifying for doctoral candidacy. Additional required coursework (exclusive of seminars) may be completed during this period. Students are required to be continually enrolled while pursuing the completion of the dissertation.
## Dissertation
After a student establishes doctoral candidacy, they must complete a dissertation that embodies the results of extended original research and includes material suitable for publication. The student is responsible for proposing a dissertation committee to be approved by the dissertation advisor at least one month prior to the dissertation defense. The committee must have a minimum of four members, including the primary advisor. At least two committee members must be faculty members in the Department of Chemical Engineering (with a greater than 0% appointment)[College of Engineering's webpage](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-student-services/dissertation-thesis-instructions/). Students are responsible for contacting the Graduate School of Engineering for any updates to dissertation requirements and appropriate deadlines.
## Dissertation Defense and Final Oral Examination
This comprehensive examination includes the public dissertation defense as well as a final oral examination to include the subject matter of the doctoral dissertation and significant developments in the field of the dissertation work. The oral presentation will be open to the public, including students, faculty, and the student’s committee.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
