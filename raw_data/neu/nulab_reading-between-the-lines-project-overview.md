Encoding A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison
By: Claire Lavarreda
I. Introduction
Over the 2023–2024 Fall and Spring semesters, I joined the [Women Writers Project](https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/) to encode A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison [text encoding.](https://tei-c.org/) As a PhD student interested in Indigenous Studies and book history, the WWP seemed like the perfect opportunity to explore text encoding, women’s writing, and Indigenous topics through A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison [WWP schema](https://www.wwp.northeastern.edu/about/methods/customization.html), completed in May 2024.

Over the Fall semester, new encoders embarked on training led by [Sarah Connell](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/person/sarah-connell/) and [Syd Bauman](https://dsg.northeastern.edu/staff/staffbio/?smid=4672). During this time, encoders were introduced to XML and TEI, practiced on Oxygen, navigated the WWP internal documentation, downloaded the WWP textbase, and gradually chose their first texts to encode on their own. It was around this time I chose A Narrative of the Life of Mrs. Mary Jemison, Indian Captive: The Story of Mary Jemison
By the Spring semester, I was well on my way through encoding, albeit very slowly. The more I worked with the text, the more I realized that the content itself also needed to be examined, leading to the second part of my project. Through two blog posts titled “Reading Between The Lines,” I aimed to explore the way in which Jemison’s voice (and female authors in general) can be “read” through male-transcribed texts. The first blog post <[Link Here](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/reading-between-the-lines-a-mini-blog-series-investigating-a-narrative-of-the-life-of-mrs-mary-jemison/)> examined first the way in which Mary Jemison describes women that shaped her life, in contrast to the way her male transcriber James Seaver represents women. To do this, I compared the uses of gendered pronouns (she and her, him and he) in Jemison’s portion of her narrative to Seaver’s portions (which were notes, prologues, and appendixes), visualizing them in [Word Trees](https://www.jasondavies.com/wordtree/). This visualization revealed that Mary Jemison portrays women as complex beings she feels kinship with, especially her adoptive sisters. In Jemison’s narrative, women are “loved,” “kind,” “diligent,” and “respect[ed].” (Jemison 40–54). Seaver, by contrast, portrays women as they serve men or are seen by men — how they look, if they have appropriate deferential behaviors, how educated they are — and treats women as two-dimensional. (Seaver v–vi, 171–175). Jemison’s voice throughout her narrative is identifiable by the way she discusses women, and transitions to Seaver’s writing are clear.
The second blog post <[Link Here](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/nulab/reading-between-the-lines-part-ii-a-mini-blog-series-investigating-a-narrative-of-the-life-of-mrs-mary-jemison/)> focused on the enduring legacy of the captivity narrative in American literature, specifically as it pertains to renditions of Jemison’s original narrative. In this post, I reviewed the work of scholars like Elena Furlanetto, who argue that captivity narratives remain popular in American society because they encourage the idea of a “frontier imaginary,” in which female captives epitomize “fierceness” and protection in the face of the racialized “Other.” (Furlanetto 6). To examine the popularity of Jemison’s narrative and trace the representation of women in her narrative over time, I used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) to create word cloud visualizations of the following retellings: Lois Lenski’s Indian Captive: The Story of Mary Jemison The WhiteMary Jemison: Native American Captive
III. The Encoding Itself
As of May 2024, I have completed the initial encoding of the entire text. Interestingly enough, specific locations are noted generously throughout the story, yet I didn’t grasp the full impact of Jemison’s references to these places until they were seen in XML. For example, the first paragraph on page fifty-three of Jemison’s narrative alone features twelve instances of the <placeName> element. These include Conowongo, Che-ua-shung-gau-tau, U-na-waum-gwa, Caneadea, Genishau, Genesee, Free Ferry, and several others. Encoding the text allows a place-centered reading of Jemison’s narrative, one not visible upon a regular read-through. The prevalence of <placeName> throughout Jemison’s narrative not only suggests that Jemison was highly aware of her environment, but also illuminates the constant movement undertaken by her and her family as they visited relatives, traded furs, harvested corn, and searched for supplies in the wake of the Revolutionary and Cherokee wars. In fact, several of the place names mentioned in Jemison’s narrative can be noted in 18th-century maps of New York, including this map from 1788 below.

Locations mentioned by Jemison, such as the Genesee River, are visible on the map.
IV. Conclusion
Thus situated in the midst of my children, I expect I shall soon leave the world, and make room for the rising generation. I feel the weight of years with which I am loaded, and am sensible of my daily failure in seeing, hearing and strength; but my only anxiety is for my family. If my family will live happily, and I can be exempted from trouble while I have to stay, I feel as though I could lay down in peace a life that has been checked in almost every hour, with troubles of a deeper dye, than are commonly experienced by mortals.

Though Jemison concludes her narrative by expecting that she “shall soon leave the world,” her story, recollections, and observations remain.
