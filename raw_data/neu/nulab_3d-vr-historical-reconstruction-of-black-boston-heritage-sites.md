# 3D/VR Historical Reconstruction of Black Boston Heritage Sites
_****Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant** **and by an American Rescue Plan award.****_
[3D Black Boston](https://3Dblackboston.com) uses immersive technologies to create virtual reality experiences of nineteenth-century African American heritage sites in Boston. Between January and August 2021, the project team researched and recreated historical spaces c. 1827-30 related to David Walker, the radical Black abolitionist famous for Walker’s Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World .
