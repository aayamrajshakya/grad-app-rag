Program overview 
##  A real-world approach to regulation 
The professional practice of regulatory affairs is becoming increasingly harmonized, and regulatory intelligence, submissions, operations, and strategy are evolving into globally based endeavors. As organizations set common guidelines and standards for these and other regulatory practices, marketing approval and post-market surveillance requirements are geographically converging.
In Northeastern’s Graduate Certificate in Global Regulatory Affairs, you’ll examine specific biomedical regulatory requirements in countries around the world and utilize your knowledge of such requirements to maintain global, rather than geographically based, regulatory practice.
