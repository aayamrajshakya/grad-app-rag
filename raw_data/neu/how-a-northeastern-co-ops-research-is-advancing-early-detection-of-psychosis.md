One in five people at high clinical risk will experience psychosis in their life. But that doesn’t mean it is inevitable or lifelong, according to Northeastern University student TaKaya McFarland.
Early intervention can prevent repeat episodes and even stop psychosis before it begins, she says.
Understanding and addressing psychosis is at the heart of TaKaya McFarland’s research. A psychology major at Northeastern, McFarland is working in a clinical research position at Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a position that grew out of a co-op she completed in fall 2023.
“They give us a lot of opportunities to learn about research, participate in data collection and work on our own independent studies,” says McFarland, whose goals include providing mental health care in a community setting.
