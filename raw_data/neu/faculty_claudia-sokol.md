Teaching Professor of Spanish 
A native of Buenos Aires, Argentina, Dr. Claudia Sokol completed her degree in gastroenterology at the University of Buenos Aires. In Argentina, she spent many years dealing with patient care in hospitals and private practice. When she moved to the United States, she decided to devote her career to teaching and training medical residents and health care professionals at prestigious institutions, including Boston University Medical Center, Harvard affiliated Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and currently Northeastern University.
She has been teaching at Northeastern since 1988. She has taught all levels of Spanish and in 1998 started a three-year program in the Bouvé College of Health Sciences teaching Spanish for health care professionals. She has also taught in the School of Business.
Dr. Sokol is fluent in both Spanish and French and is committed to broadening students’ exposure to the study of culture.
