# Why Get Involved?
# Growth
Expand your perspectives on yourself and your career by engaging with people outside of your academic field from all over the world. Regardless of your degree, professional or research-based, you increase your hireability and the applicability of your field of study to a wide range of career paths by exposing yourself to diverse arrays of young professionals through events and programming. You also increase your capacity to positively impact the world.
# Skill-Building
Leadership, time management, event planning, budgeting, public speaking, teamwork, and more! Jobs today are hiring for skills, not just degrees: a degree will help get you in the door, but your skills will be what gets you the job. Bolster your resume and professional potential by taking on organizational leadership roles. Graduate student leaders have a leg up on the competition.
# Networking
You never know what connections might (literally) pay off down the road! Find your community that gives you life and makes graduate school more supportive, enriching, and exciting. The more people you know, and the more connections you make, the more opportunities open up for mentorship, development, and learning.
# Mental Health
Graduate school should challenge you and push you to achieve new heights you were unaware even existed. But it should also be enjoyable and fun! What’s more, studies have shown that downtime makes us more productive and engaged workers. Whatever your reasons, it’s important to diversify your time by participating in different kinds of activities and letting yourself breathe: intellectually, physically, and emotionally.
# Organizing Your Life
The best student leaders and co-curricular practitioners succeed inside and outside the classroom, creatively integrating lessons learned in both environments. We encourage you to explore these strategy handouts and guides to help take steps towards integrating “work” and “life” in ways that help you excel across the board.
# Strategy Handouts
Students are at an advantage when they have a good grasp of their strengths and difficulties, a repertoire of varied strategies they can employ depending upon the academic task, and an ability to use that knowledge to proactively manage their education.
