Assistant Professor of History 
Jessica C. Linker is a historian of early America and digital scholar. She is working on a book project that examines how women practiced science in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and the various social and cultural trends that contemporaneously or retroactively obscured their labor. She is also interested in the ways virtual and augmented reality can be used in historical teaching and research. Her research has been supported by the McNeil Center for Early American Studies, the Library Company of Philadelphia, the American Philosophical Society, and the New York Public Library. She additionally co-directs Northeastern’s Huskiana Press, an experiential letterpress studio.
