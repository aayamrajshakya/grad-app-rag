Gavin Shatkin’s research focuses on globalization, social equity, and sustainability in the rapidly urbanizing societies of Asia. His recent research includes a National Science Foundation funded project investigating the impacts of climate change-induced flooding in Southeast Asian metropolises on political debates about urban planning and policy and debates about property rights and infrastructure-induced displacement. He has previously conducted research on urban megaprojects, on planning for mega-urban regions, and on the role of community organizing and collective action in urban community development in Asian cities. His most recent book is Cities for Profit: The Real Estate Turn in Asia’s Urban Politics
