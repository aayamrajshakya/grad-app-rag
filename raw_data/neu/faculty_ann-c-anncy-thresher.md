#  Ann C (Anncy)Thresher
Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Religion and Public Policy and Urban Affairs 
Ann C (Anncy) Thresher is an applied ethicist whose work focuses on emerging environmental technologies and, in particular, what risks we’re warranted in taking to solve environmental crises. As part of this, she works with scientists and policy-makers to help identify and solve the ethics questions that arise out of their work. Within this she works on topics like the use of gene-drives for conservation, how to effectively build and apply research moratoriums, why we should trust science (and how to identify pseudo-science), and the role of anger in motivating public action to solve the environmental crisis. She also works in the philosophy of space and is currently working on the ethical and environmental problems of telescope siting as part of the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope.
