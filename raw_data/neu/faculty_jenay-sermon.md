## Biography
I am a qualitative-dominant, mixed methods researcher with an array of interests from metacognitive skills development; ethnography; ethnographic learner analysis in instructional design, UX research; systemically undervalued groups in postsecondary; alt postsecondary pathways; and alt tech training and career pathways for otherwise marginalized persons. I enjoy participating in work that adds agency and creates impact and learning opportunities for those systemically underserved. I have served broadly in education roles in K12, state government, and higher education. I have expertise in the areas of applied behavior analysis, course/curriculum and instructional design, program evaluation, higher education faculty development, and learning science/engineering applications. I have served as a consultant in start-up, non-profit, and education organizations across sectors, including energy, EdTech, finance, government, higher education, and non-profit social services.
