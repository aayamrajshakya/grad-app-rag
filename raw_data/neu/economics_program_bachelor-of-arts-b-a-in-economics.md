#  Bachelor of Arts in Economics
The Bachelor of Arts degree in economics maintains the tradition of the liberal arts with the language and arts courses required to satisfy the university’s BA degree requirements. Along with the six core courses in economics, students may choose from over 40 electives. Many of these electives continue this liberal arts tradition with courses that focus on economic literature, economic history, the history of economic thought, and political economy. Students considering future doctoral studies in economics are strongly encouraged to pursue a double major in economics (BS) and mathematics (BS) or choose our combined economics/mathematics major.
