## Innovative Curriculum - MS in Engineering Management
Engineering Management is the art and science of planning, organizing, allocating, directing and controlling the activities and resources applicable to individuals and organizations engaged in the management of engineering activities and technology development, including: project management, economic evaluation of systems, technology transfer, management of research programs, development, design, evaluation, production, and allied activities.
The current program of study can be taken on a part time or full time basis. There are four core courses required of all students which have been formulated to satisfy the foundation requirements. In addition to these required courses the curriculum consists of electives which allow students to choose either a broad based program of study or one centered on a particular concentration. Some students may elect to refresh or enhance their technical skills in engineering-based subjects such as information systems, software engineering systems, or graduate courses from the traditional engineering disciplines. Other students may prefer to broaden their knowledge base by selecting coursework in management subjects such as engineering organizational psychology, financial management, logistics and warehousing or lean systems design.

## Experiential Learning
Northeastern combines rigorous academics with experiential learning and research to prepare students for real-world engineering challenges. The [Cooperative Education Program](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/co-op-experiential-learning/co-op/graduate-co-op/), also known as a “co-op,” is one of the largest and most innovative in the world, and Northeastern is one of only a few that offers a Co-op Program for graduate students. Through this program students gain up to eight months of professional experience, employed in their field of interest as part of the academic curriculum, giving them a competitive advantage after graduation.

Sharon Melul Steinfeld, BS Industrial Engineering/MS Engineering Management, did a co-op at PwC and at Hasbro and got a full time job offer before graduation. 
## Program Goals
Educational Objectives
The program was designed by experienced high level managers and academic leaders as an option for engineers and scientists to broaden their skill sets to include management tools and techniques that are applicable to technology-based industries. Graduates of the Engineering Management program work as project managers, product managers, or leaders of teams in technical industries. Upon completion of the program, students find that their acquired skills are applicable to a wide range of industries primarily those focused upon the development of technical products and the management of technical projects.
Graduates may assist companies in bringing a product from an idea through its development phases to its introduction to the marketplace. They may also be involved in forming and managing teams for assessing cost-effectiveness, formulating strategies to improve production, or analyzing a company’s supply chain. Most of these projects cannot be successfully completed without the skills of those possessing a background in management decision making and engineering expertise; therefore, the engineering management graduate is often a technical liaison to all levels of management. As a result, many of the assignments held by engineering management graduates have actually proven to be a gateway to upper-level management positions.
> "Northeastern's MS in Engineering Management is like an MBA for engineers, with high-quality, dedicated professors who are proficient in their field yet are able to convey information in a way that's easy to understand."
> "My courses in project management have been key to understanding the subtleties that affect project managers while technical courses provide a strong background in fundamentals as well as specialty topics. My experience with co-op has been outstanding and has truly helped me further my career."
> "It's not enough to have theoretical knowledge, you need to be able to effectively communicate and apply it to solve problems.” Keshab Siddhant, MS’24, engineering management 
> "I wanted a path where both engineering and business merged. I wanted to take ownership of projects, but didn’t want to let go of engineering.” Vibin Roy, MS’23, engineering management 
> “In a startup environment, you need someone who can solve diverse problems—operations, process, strategy. Northeastern gave me that versatility.” Subash Rajaseelan, MS’23, engineering management
