In order to maintain their status, they must apply for this extension before their current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date.

####  [ Am I able to get a program extension after my I-20 program end date has passed? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/understanding-visa-requirements/program-extention/#collapse-1)
No, after your program end date has passed, OGS is no longer able to extend your program. If you believe that you will need a program extension, please make sure that you apply with OGS well in advance. Not extending before your program end date will result in you losing valid F or J status and require corrective action at considerable expense to a student and potential loss of F-1 or J-1 benefits.
