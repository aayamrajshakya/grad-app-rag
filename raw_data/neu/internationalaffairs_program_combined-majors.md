#  CombinedMajors
  
Students who wish to take more than one major may pursue a combined major between International Affairs and one of the other programs below. A combined major differs from a double major in that the departments have eliminated some overlap between the majors, reducing the overall credit load but maintaining the academic rigor and learning objectives of both majors.
### Bachelor of Arts (BA) Combined Majors with International Affairs:
Environmental Studies and International Affairs
Through this combined major, successful undergraduates will develop an awareness of the international issues that influence the scientific, cultural, societal, political, and economic aspects of the world’s environmental problems and the ways in which such environmental challenges can be ameliorated and/or solved.
