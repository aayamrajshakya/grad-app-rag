## How is my Award Determined?
Your financial aid offer is based on several factors, including your FAFSA, academic profile, and availability of funding for your specific graduate program. At the graduate level, most grant funding is determined by the academic program at the point of admission. Students who submit the FAFSA may also be considered for Federal loans and Graduate Federal Work Study.
