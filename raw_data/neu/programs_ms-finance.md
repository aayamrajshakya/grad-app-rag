### [Challenging uncertainty through an MS in Finance](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/news/challenging-uncertainty-through-an-ms-in-finance/)
“Looking back, Northeastern didn't just prepare me academically. It taught me how to take risks, embrace uncertainty, and step out of my comfort zone. I'll carry that with me beyond graduation, and I'm so grateful for it.” – Sasha Burnett, MS in Finance'24, BS in Finance'23

“When I told my friends that you can actually run a real fund here, they couldn't believe it. They had never had that opportunity themselves. It's a really attractive part of the program and gives you experience in investments that a book can't teach you,” said Yifei Li who earned an MS in Finance in 2019.
