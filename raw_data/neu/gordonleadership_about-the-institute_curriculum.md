Many Gordon Fellow Candidates pursue the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program as part of one of many Master of Science degrees offered by Northeastern University. Students may also pursue the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership as a stand-alone graduate certificate.
For most master’s degree programs the total number of required semester-hours remains the same when pursuing an MS degree with the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership.
All GIEL coursework requirements are completed over the course of one calendar yearMaster of Science degree can be completed before, after, or in parallel with the following GIEL coursework requirements[Degree and Certificate Options](https://gordon.northeastern.edu/certificate-and-degree-options/) page.
Students who pursue the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership as a stand-alone certificate will only be required to complete the course work listed below. All students, regardless of their chosen master’s degree program, will be required to complete the following 16 semester-hours of Gordon Engineering Leadership coursework
### Engineering Leadership 1
ENLR 5121 – 2 semester-hours | Covers elements of engineering practices such as product engineering (system design and engineering, integration, and documentation); engineering leadership (team building, communication, leadership styles, ethical behavior, and conflict resolution); market assessment (engineering economics, business plans, intellectual property, risk assessment, and mitigation); and engineering excellence (quality, reliability, serviceability, manufacturability, procurement, and problem solving).  
---|---  
### Engineering Leadership 2
ENLR 5122 – 2 semester-hours | Continues the examination of engineering practices begun in ENLR 5121.  
### Scientific Principles of Engineering 1
ENLR 5131 – 2 semester-hours | Presents the fundamental science underlying engineering disciplines. Develops a conceptual framework to understand interdisciplinary engineering practice and to make informed, back-of-the-envelope, quantitative estimates. Covers topics such as principles of mechanics and mechanics of materials, wave physics, quantum physics, statistical and thermal physics, fluid physics, Maxwell’s equations and constitutive relations, and topics in chemistry and biology.  
### Scientific Principles of Engineering 2
ENLR 5132 – 2 semester-hours | Continues the examination of fundamental science begun in ENLR 5131.  
### Engineering Leadership Challenge Project 1
ENLR 7440 – 4 semester-hours | Offers students the opportunity to develop and present a plan for the demonstration of a marketable technology product or prototype. This course is the first half of a thesis-scale project in technology commercialization.  
### Engineering Leadership Challenge Project 2
ENLR 7442 – 4 semester-hours | Continues ENLR 7440, a thesis-scale project in technology commercialization. Offers students the opportunity to demonstrate their development of a marketable technology product or prototype and produce a written documentary report on the project to the satisfaction of an advising committee.
