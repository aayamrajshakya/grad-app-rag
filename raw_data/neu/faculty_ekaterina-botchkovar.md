#  EkaterinaBotchkovar
PhD Program Director; Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice 
Professor Botchkovar examines crime through a cross-cultural, global lens, focusing on how social contexts influence criminal behavior. Much of her earlier work explored how political, cultural, and socioeconomic changes shaped the lives of Russians and Ukrainians before the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian war. This included studies of various criminological theories and ways in which established predictors influenced individual behavior in Russia and Ukraine.
Professor Botchkovar’s current research incorporates both traditional and online forms of crime. One of her ongoing projects seeks to understand how exposure to the Russo-Ukrainian war influences the psychological well-being and behavioral patterns of adults residing in Ukraine. Her work seeks to identify both the short- and long-term effects of war-related stressors, as well as the resilience strategies individuals use to mitigate these challenges.
Another major focus of her research is the intersection of social context and cybercrime. Professor Botchkovar explores how the ecosystems of dark web forums enable and sustain various forms of online crime, including fraud, malware production, and illicit trade. This project aims to uncover the socioeconomic and sociocultural factors that drive the proliferation of cybercrime within hidden online communities, providing insights into effective strategies for its disruption and prevention.
Professor Botchkovar publishes in leading journals in the fields of criminology and sociology. Her publications have appeared in Criminology, Journal of Quantitative Criminology, Justice Quarterly, Journal of Research in Crime and Delinquency, Social Forces, British Journal of Criminology
