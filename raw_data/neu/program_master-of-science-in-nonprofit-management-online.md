> I would 100% recommend this program. We worked directly with nonprofit organizations, helping them build marketing plans or working with their boards. The faculty are also amazing and experienced. The classes were very in-depth whether online or in person. I met so many intelligent people; a lot of them were already working in the field which was great to learn from.
