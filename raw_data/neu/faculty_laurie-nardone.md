#  LaurieNardone
Teaching Professor in English; Director of the Writing Program 
Laurie Nardone joined Northeastern’s Department of English in 2008 to teach in the Writing Program. From an undergraduate study on the representation of the Salem Witch Trials in literature, Laurie focused her graduate work on film theory and gender studies in postmodern British and American texts. Her first-year classes employ a range of texts from music video and film to scholarly essays, offering writing students a wide-reaching opportunity to engage in college-level intellectual conversations. In her Advanced Writing classes, Laurie encourages students to explore what it means to write in a field of specialty. Laurie has also taught at Boston University and Emory University. In addition to teaching, she has published medical writing in Parade MagazineWebMD
