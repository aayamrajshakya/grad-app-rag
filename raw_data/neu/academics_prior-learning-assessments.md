## Credit for Prior Learning
Turn your experience and professional certifications into academic credits.
We’re great at figuring out how to transfer credits. If you have any of these professional certifications through a sponsoring organization, we can do a Prior Learning Assessment to help turn that experience into credits that count towards a CPS degree.
