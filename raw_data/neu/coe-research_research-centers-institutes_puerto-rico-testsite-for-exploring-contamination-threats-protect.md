#  PROTECT Center 
Supported with funding from the [National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences’ Superfund Research Program](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/supported/centers/srp/index.cfm), the [PROTECT Center](https://protect.sites.northeastern.edu/) studies exposure to environmental contamination in Puerto Rico and its contribution to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth (less than 37 completed weeks of gestation). Rates of preterm birth and infant mortality in Puerto Rico are among the highest of all US states and territories.
There are 18 [Superfund sites](https://www.epa.gov/superfund/search-superfund-sites-where-you-live) in Puerto Rico, and evidence of contamination of the drinking water is extensive. Extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, or flooding, may also result in elevated exposures to [Superfund chemicals](https://www.epa.gov/superfund). Although Puerto Rico is an island with an unusually high burden of pollution, PROTECT is the first project to investigate the causal relationships between environmental pollutants and adverse pregnancy outcomes in this at-risk population.
The PROTECT Center seeks to understand the mechanisms by which exposure to mixtures of suspect chemicals contribute to adverse pregnancy outcomes. To conduct these analyses, the PROTECT Center develops new statistical methods and data mining, machine learning, and visualization tools. The Center also investigates the impacts of extreme weather events on contaminant transport and exposure, and new water treatment technologies are being developed for portable and robust water treatment systems. The PROTECT Center continues to employ innovative approaches to engage and educate the community, involve study participants, report data, and communicate with stakeholders.
PROTECT is a multi-project, multi-institution collaboration that involves five primary institutions: [Northeastern University](http://www.neu.edu/), [University of Puerto Rico, Medical Sciences Campus](http://www.upr.edu/), [University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez](http://www.uprm.edu/), [University of Georgia](http://www.uga.edu/), and [University of Michigan](http://www.umich.edu/). Collaborators also include [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), [West Virginia University](http://www.wvu.edu/), [Silent Spring Institute](http://www.silentspring.org/), and [EarthSoft Inc](http://earthsoft.com/).

Bouve/CEE Assistant Professor Julia Varshavsky’s research from a study she led in Puerto Rico in affiliation with the PROTECT Center was published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. It shows chemicals like phenols and parabens in products such as sunscreen and makeup can result in long-term health problems for both the woman and fetus.
