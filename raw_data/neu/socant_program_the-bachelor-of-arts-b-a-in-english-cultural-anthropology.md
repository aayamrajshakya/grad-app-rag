#  Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) inEnglish and Cultural Anthropology
The English department and the sociology/anthropology department offer an interdisciplinary combined major in English and cultural anthropology. Broadly speaking, students in the combined major in English and cultural anthropology at Northeastern integrate the study of literature, language, and writing with the study of human culture and its intersections with structures of inequality (e.g., race, class, and gender) and contemporary global issues.
