#  SarahKanouse
Associate Professor of Media Arts 
Sarah Kanouse is an interdisciplinary artist and writer examining the politics of landscape and public space. Her research-based creative projects trace the production of landscape through ecological, historical, and legal forces, particularly focusing on the environmental and cultural effects of military activities. Her award-winning, feature-length film, “Around Crab Orchard,” addresses how the politics of conservation and environmental justice are imbricated with military and penal economies deeply in an American wildlife refuge. She is one half of the National Toxic Land/Labor Conservation service, a ‘wishful’ government agency addressing the cultural and ecological impacts of nuclear militarism, and a core member of Compass, an art collaborative currently staging a series of performative hearings into the intergenerational and inter-species impacts of industrial agriculture on regional and global systems. Working with Nicholas Brown, she recently published the photo-text book Re-Collecting Black HawkArt Journal, Acme, LeonardoParallaxCritical Landscapes, Art Against the LawMapping Environmental Issues in the City
