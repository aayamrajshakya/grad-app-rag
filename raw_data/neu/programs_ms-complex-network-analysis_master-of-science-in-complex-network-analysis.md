Program overview 
##  Advance in a networked world 
Network science has revolutionized many fields, including public health, sociology, business, and finance. Northeastern University’s Master of Science in Complex Network Analysis gives students the practical skills and experience they need to analyze, draw meaning from, and act upon massive datasets in their chosen specialization.
You’ll build a strong foundation in complex network analysis, supplemented by domain-specific coursework. You can choose to study the structure and dynamic processes of epidemiology and public health, online social networks and interactions, or economic networks with one of three unique learning tracks. Each specialization is taught by expert faculty with real-world experience in each field.

Concentrations 
Complex Social Systems
Students gain data analysis skills and become proficient with computational tools, equipping them to analyze a range of social systems and study how online social networks facilitate and amplify the spread of information. These skills offer students a competitive advantage in the ever-evolving landscape of social data in today’s tech and scientific industries. Coursework includes:
  * Urban data analytics
  * Digital trace data analysis
  * Collective and cooperative behavior
  * Computational statistics


Economic and Technological Networks
Students gain the practical skill set to understand and predict market trends, risks, and opportunities using network analysis tools. Students will be equipped with the skills to tackle complex economic networks of today—and tomorrow. Coursework includes:
  * Financial and economic networks
  * Econometrics
  * AI and machine learning


Population Health Dynamics
Students build on a strong foundation in complex network analysis specifically designed to expose students to the kinds of questions public health experts face every day. Expert faculty, who work directly with the nation’s top public health agencies, teach cutting-edge approaches to modeling and characterizing the spread of infectious diseases, exposing students to the panoply of ways that complex network analysis has changed the landscape of population health and, most importantly, how they can help in future outbreaks. Coursework includes:
  * Biostatistics and epidemiology
  * Network modeling of infectious diseases
  * Population health informatics


Complex Biological Networks
Students build a knowledge base around a range of topics in biomedical research, biotech, and emerging industries like network medicine and personalized therapeutics. They will study biological systems at multiple scales, from gene regulation and protein interactions to ecological networks. Coursework includes:
  * Bioinformatics
  * Computational biology
  * Network medicine


Unique features 
  * The program is led by the world’s preeminent network science organization and taught by faculty who pioneered the field.
  * The program includes over 20 faculty, 40 postdocs, and 40 PhD students, totaling more than a hundred network science researchers.
  * Students are immersed in the vibrant intellectual community of the Network Science Institute featuring frequent lectures by some of the world’s most prominent scholars and practitioners of network science.
  * Industry connections to network science give students opportunities for real-world experience.
  * The program combines quantitative analysis and visualizations so students understand the techniques and are able to communicate them effectively.
  * Graduates are well-prepared for work in data science and technology, public health, and social analysis of markets, urban populations, and more.


Experiential learning 
Students in this program will engage in experiential learning in three ways.
First, instructor-led experiential learning will be embedded into coursework and learning assessments as a design principle, guiding the creation of new courses. From the outset of the program, students will be exposed to the complex challenges of sourcing, cleaning, and analyzing network data and will practice gaining insights from real-world situations.
Second, research rotation, capstone, or thesis courses provide student-led experiential learning opportunities. While the challenges tackled here will be unique to the student (i.e., their interests and emerging topics in the field), the research will be closely aligned with the authentic tasks faced by network scientists.
Third, students are encouraged to participate in a range of cocurricular experiential learning opportunities such as hack-a-thons and cocurricular industry events. These events may occur in response to emergent current events and/or in conjunction with community/industry partners.
In this way, these experiential learning opportunities will be driven by business and societal needs. Students who wish to engage in deeper experiential learning may also participate in a co-op.
