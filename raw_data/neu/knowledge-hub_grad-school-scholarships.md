One of the biggest changes in making the transition from an undergraduate education to graduate school is paying tuition. 
Undergraduate students are eligible for need-based subsidized loans and grants that don’t need to be paid back—but that’s not the case for graduate students. Some students may be able to get a teaching assistant position or a fellowship, and working professionals may receive [tuition reimbursement](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/tuition-reimbursement/) from their employer, but many students are on their own.
It’s not unusual in the graduate school world to pay tuition costs out of your own pocket or to take out loans. That’s why it’s important for prospective students to explore scholarships and other options to pay for graduate school. Northeastern University offers a variety of need- and merit-based [scholarships for graduate students](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/graduate/types-of-aid/), and aid is available from nonprofit and professional organizations, as well. 
If you’re concerned about [paying for graduate school](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/resources/paying-for-graduate-school/), here’s a look at the available financial aid options, along with some tips for a smooth application process.
## Northeastern University graduate scholarships and fellowships
Northeastern offers numerous scholarship programs for graduate students. Some awards are built into the admissions process, which means that students don’t need to apply, while other awards do require a separate application. Graduate students who receive more than one offer of financial aid are only eligible for the scholarship of higher value.
### [Double Husky Scholarship](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-financial-aid/scholarships/double-husky-scholarship/)
Northeastern alumni with a bachelor’s degree are automatically considered for the Double Husky Scholarship when they are admitted to a graduate or certificate program. This graduate school scholarship offers a 25% tuition discount and applies to more than 120 programs.
### [Full Circle Scholarship](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/full-circle-scholarship/)
Graduate program applicants who are currently involved in or have completed a term of service with AmeriCorps, the Peace Corps, Teach for America, or who have spent at least one year teaching English in a foreign country are eligible for the Full Circle Scholarship. This award offers a 25% tuition discount and recognizes a prospective student’s commitment to service and global learning.
The Full Circle Scholarship applies to more than 150 graduate degree and certificate programs and can be used at any Northeastern campus. Prospective students must verify their service with these organizations (or their overseas teaching contract) on their Northeastern application. New, incoming students are eligible to apply for the Full Circle Scholarship; however, currently enrolled students are not eligible to apply.
### [Parent and Family Scholarship](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/parent-and-family-scholarship/)
Parents and siblings of full-time undergraduate students enrolled in a day program at Northeastern are eligible for the Parent and Family Scholarship. The award recognizes that family members may delay their own goals for higher learning to support a relative’s undergraduate education. 
The Parent and Family scholarship offers a 25% tuition discount and can be applied to more than 120 graduate programs. To qualify, prospective students simply need to provide the Northeastern ID number of their child or sibling with their application. 
### [Martin Luther King Jr. Graduate Fellowship ](https://www.northeastern.edu/aai/programs/mlk-fellowship/)
The [J.D. O’Bryant African-American Institute](https://www.northeastern.edu/aai/) offers six full-tuition Martin Luther King Jr. Graduate Fellowships to full-time students based on financial need. To qualify, students must complete the financial aid process and apply directly through the African-American Institute. 
### Merit scholarships
Students in graduate programs may also be considered for available merit-based scholarships through their application for admission, as well as available scholarship opportunities through their department or college. Please note that scholarship eligibility criteria may vary depending on the scholarship and the program or college. To be considered for merit-based scholarships through your college or program, you must submit your application for admission by the application deadline date.
Some examples include:
  * [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/apply/masters-apply/financial-support-for-masters-students/)—Scholarships and grants are available for students pursuing a career in cybersecurity. In addition, the National GEM Consortium offers a fellowship program for students who are members of underrepresented groups in the science and engineering fields. 
  * [College of Engineering](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academics-experiential-learning/graduate-school-of-engineering/graduate-tuition-financial-aid/)—Grants and fellowships are available to help full-time students support their graduate thesis or PhD dissertation research. 
  * [D’Amore-McKim School of Business](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/)—Numerous scholarships are available for MBA students who are affiliated with organizations such as City Year, the Peace Corps, AmeriCorps, Teach for America, or Reach Out. 
  * **[College of Professional Studies (CPS)](https://cps.northeastern.edu/admissions-aid/scholarships/)** —CPS offers the [MacFarland Scholarship](https://cps.northeastern.edu/tuition-financial-aid/scholarships/macfarland) for up to $10,000 to new, incoming graduate students working as educators in a public school at the elementary or secondary level within an urban area.
  * [College of Social Sciences and Humanities (CSSH)](https://cssh.northeastern.edu/apply/financial-aid-and-awards/)—All eligible applicants admitted to the CSSH master’s programs are considered for Excellence Awards and Tuition Scholarships.


Some scholarships awarded by academic departments don’t require an additional application, but it’s a good idea to check with individual departments to determine what awards are available, what supplemental information is needed, and what are the terms of the financial aid. “Each college uses its own standards for whom they fund, based on their own admission goals,” she adds. 
These opportunities for aid are managed by individual academic departments and not the Office of Student Financial Services. 
### Military scholarships
Under the [Post-9/11 GI Bill®](https://www.va.gov/education/about-gi-bill-benefits/), veterans are eligible for up to $27,120 in financial aid for the 2023–2024 academic year, along with a $1,000 stipend for books and an annual housing allowance that varies depending on the Northeastern University campus a student attends. Through the [Yellow Ribbon Program](https://www.northeastern.edu/military/fund-your-education/yellow-ribbon-program/), Northeastern will cover any balance above the GI Bill’s cap, allowing veterans to attend the University for minimal to no cost.
To apply for the Yellow Ribbon Program, prospective students must verify their eligibility with the Department of Veterans Affairs, provide a certificate of eligibility to the [Dolce Center for the Advancement of Veterans and Servicemembers](https://www.northeastern.edu/military/student-resources/cavs/), and submit a separate Yellow Ribbon application.
Other [military scholarships at Northeastern](https://www.northeastern.edu/military/fund-your-education/scholarships/) include, but are not limited to:
  * The Patriot Scholar Program
  * The Phi Gamma Pi Veterans Scholarship—


These scholarships have unique eligibility requirements that can be found on the [Northeastern military website](https://military.northeastern.edu/fund-your-education/).
## Additional graduate school scholarship options
A number of searchable online databases can help prospective and current graduate students find outside graduate school scholarships. 
One example is the U.S. Department of Labor’s [Career One Stop Scholarship Search](https://www.careeronestop.org/toolkit/training/find-scholarships.aspx). The site includes information about nearly 3,000 awards for graduate study, including the amount available, the application deadline, and any required qualifications. 
The [Office of Student Financial Services](https://studentfinance.northeastern.edu/applying-for-aid/graduate/types-of-aid/) also provides links to several other databases on its webpage. Student Financial Services encourages students to stick to these sites, as they have been vetted for reputability. They also discourage the use of paid services that offer to help graduate students find scholarships. 
Massachusetts-based students looking for help understanding their graduate school scholarship options can turn to [American Student Assistance](https://www.asa.org/planning/#in_person_programming). ASA is a college and career planning program operated by the nonprofit [MassEdCO](https://www.massedco.org/adult-learners), which focuses on providing assistance to low-income and first-generation adults throughout the state. Along with scholarship support, ASA can help prospective students develop a college savings plan and determine an affordable amount for student loan payments after they graduate.
