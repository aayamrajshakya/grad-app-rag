#  PeterFraunholtz
Assistant Teaching Professor in History and International Affairs 
Pete Fraunholtz teaches courses for the History Department, International Affairs, and the Global Studies MA Program. Recent and upcoming courses focus on The Vietnam Wars, The World in a Decade: 1990s, Emerging Economies, History of the Soviet Union, and The Mediterranean World. Professor Fraunholtz’s academic work experience has included travel to Germany, Russia (for nearly two years in the early 1990s), France, Turkey, Hungary, China, and, for many of the last 12 years, Morocco as Faculty Leader for the NU Dialogue of Civilization program. His research scholarship focuses on Revolutionary Russia, specifically civil war-era food supply and grain procurement challenges and policies, primarily in the Middle Volga region, 1918-1920. Based on primary research conducted in St. Petersburg, Moscow, and the Middle Volga province of Penza, his work challenges key aspects of the standard Western narrative concerning the Bolsheviks’ approach to the Russian countryside during the civil war years.
