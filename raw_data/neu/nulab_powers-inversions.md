**Partially supported by a NULab Seedling Grant.**
“Power’s Inversions” consists of an ArcGIS StoryMap that explores the use of public space and private space before, during, and after the three-day “riot” called the “Battle of the Bogside.” This 1969 clash between Derry, Northern Ireland residents and law enforcement officers was a major flash point for the start of what has come to be known as the ‘The Troubles,’ a conflict spanning three decades (1969-1998) waged over the status of Northern Ireland.
This project—somewhat of a continuation of Grant’s previous work, “[Roadmap to The Troubles](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstorymaps.arcgis.com%2Fstories%2F39e076b6fe4a4558a72338cba124c099&data=05%7C01%7Crosario.ja%40northeastern.edu%7Ccef10b3f07a24474d2ad08da5ac85ed3%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C637922113883160368%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=lGcYGLkZgokBexL%2FtZC3Ou2AHg5kwNM6qjDAMZBgy1w%3D&reserved=0)“—will address a high school audience and will encourage students to consider the inversion of public and private space during times of state-sanctioned violence. Through a combination of maps, media, and storytelling depicting the event, users will explore the spatial dimensions of power and control. Each section will also include a learning resource to help guide students through this space.
