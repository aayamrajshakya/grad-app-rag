### NSF Mentorship Training
The Mentoring Journey: From Mentee to Mentor, Fostering the Next Generation
In order to satisfy the NSF RCR Mentorship requirement, a recording of the October 2025 Mentorship Panel is available: [NU-RES RCR Training Course: Mentorship (2025 Version)](https://www.myworkday.com/northeastern/learning/course/462113a271651000b8c52bf816b90000?type=9882927d138b100019b928e75843018d)
**Description:**
Effective mentorship is fundamental to fostering the next generation of scholars and researchers. You may already be filling the role of mentor and not even know it! Throughout many professional careers, most people find themselves as lifelong mentors and mentees. This recorded panel discussion, hosted by NU-RES Compliance in partnership with the ADVANCE Office, brings together accomplished faculty from across Northeastern’s colleges to share their mentorship journeys and insights. The conversation explores discipline-specific mentoring considerations, common challenges faced when transitioning into mentor roles, and strategies for overcoming early hurdles in mentoring.
This session is particularly valuable for early-career faculty and those newly stepping into mentoring roles, and all faculty and staff are encouraged to view the recording. Whether you’re involved in research supervision, classroom teaching, or both, this panel provides practical insights and inspiration for building meaningful mentoring relationships that support academic and professional growth.

### Research Security and Other Support Module
NU-RES Research Training Course 1: Foundations of Research Security
  
National Security Presidential Memorandum-33 (NSPM-33), issued by the White House on January 14, 2021, aims to protect U.S. Government-supported Research and Development (R&D) from foreign interference and exploitation. It mandates comprehensive research security programs for covered institutions addressing four key areas: cybersecurity, foreign travel security, research security training (RST), and export control training. To meet the RST requirements, as detailed in the CHIPS & Science Act of 2022, the NSF, DOE, NIH, and DoD funded four RST modules. The SECURE Center has condensed these modules into one shorter module to meet the RST requirements of federal funding agencies. The full individual modules are also available through Northeastern University’s Research Security Training Program and the NSF.
This training also satisfies the NIH – Other Support Training requirement related to NIH NOT-OD-25-133.
