Definition of full-time for immigration purposes
For students enrolled in graduate programs, NU considers students registered in 8 or more credits per academic semester/quarter, except for scheduled breaks, to be full-time student, for the purpose of Canadian immigration.
During scheduled breaks, students may choose to take the break or have a part-time/ full-time course load if courses are available.
Students on Co-op
Students are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they are registered with the proper non-credit co-op course during the co-op term, as reflected on their transcript.
Students with special accommodations
Students with reduced course load are considered to be full-time for immigration purposes if they have received official approval from the [Disability Access Services](https://disabilityaccessservices.sites.northeastern.edu/) of NU for special accommodations.
Graduating students
Students who have completed the final course towards graduation and while awaiting the letter of completion to be available are considered by NU to be full-time for immigration purposes.

Frequently Asked Questions »
##### Frequently Asked Questions
×
####  [ Q. Will a part time status on my tax form affect my PGWP? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/post-graduation-work-permit/#collapse-1)
If the information on your tax form is incorrect, then that is an issue to resolve with SFS. If you were actually part-time during a term, then you may be required to explain this to IRCC on your PGWP application. If you were part-time during a regular academic term, then your eligibility for the PGWP may be affected.
IRCC and CRA do not share information except for two situations:
  1. There is an investigation due to suspected fraud.
  2. You have applied for Canadian citizenship and IRCC needs to verify your residency and tax status to support your Citizenship application.


Your PGWP eligibility will be assessed on your enrolment records with the Registrar’s Office and on the compliance report that we submit biannually to IRCC.
####  [ Q. How will co-op be shown on my transcript? Will this affect my PGWP application? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/post-graduation-work-permit/#collapse-2)
Your co-op will be indicated on your transcript in the appropriate term. If you believe that your transcript doesn’t properly represent what you were doing each term, then be sure to include a letter of explanation with your PGWP application. As an example, if you took a part-time course load while working on co-op, and your registration status for that term is showing as part-time, then include that information in your letter of explanation with your PGWP application.
####  [ Q. How are summer breaks shown on my letter of program completion or transcript? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/post-graduation-work-permit/#collapse-3)
If your program has a summer break, then this should be shown in the academic calendar for your program, or if you have a modified program, in your course or program map. Studying part-time or full-time during a scheduled break in your program is fine, and will not affect your PGWP. Courses taken during breaks still need to be the majority on ground, as your program is assessed overall, including studies done during non-mandatory terms.
####  [ Q. Can I get a letter explaining my enrolment status and showing summer breaks? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/student-support/global-campuses/canada/post-graduation-work-permit/#collapse-4)
You will receive a letter to verify that you have completed your program requirements, to support your PGWP. You will also need to obtain a transcript to submit with your PGWP application. If you have taken a part-time course load or an authorized leave or have another unique situation, you would need to explain and document this in a letter of explanation with your PGWP application.
