We work with educators to promote educational principles and practices that value diversity and intentionally foster inclusive learning environments.
Creating learning environments in which all students’ prior experience is respected, validated, and welcomed is the basis for enriching the educational climate and increasing the transferable knowledge and skills students develop.
