#  IMPORTANT CHANGES TO OGS COMMUNICATIONS: Inquiry Form is Live! 
### Dear Northeastern Students and Alumni,
**Beginning on December 7, 2023, OGS deactivated its general office email addresses and implement a newly designed inquiry form in our self-service portal.**
Effective immediately, students are encouraged to contact OGS through one of the below methods for  
any inquiries or concerns:
  1. Submit a question online through our [new inquiry form](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs?id=ogs_ask_a_question&sys_id=47cb95e387e1759011b72fc5dabb3512) in the [OGS self-service portal](https://service.northeastern.edu/ogs)
  2. Call us over the phone (U.S.-based students) at +1-617-373-2310
  3. Visit us on the Boston Campus at 354 Richards Hall during regular office hours, or for [walk-in](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/contact/)  
advising hours during the established hours
  4. For students currently studying at a Canadian campus, please email  
[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bdf2faeefedcd3dcd9dcfcd9cbd4ced4d3dafdd3d2cfc9d5d8dccec9d8cfd393d8d9c8) or check the links for drop-in advising hours or to make  
an appointment:
  5. Toronto: <https://studentlifetoronto.sites.northeastern.edu/student-support-services/>
  6. Vancouver: [Office of Global Services](https://northeastern.sharepoint.com/:u:/r/sites/VancouverCampusStudentHub/SitePages/Office-of-Global-Services.aspx?csf=1&web=1&e=0gGSt6)


As we outlined in an email announcement in late-September, OGS will no longer accept inbound emails to our previously used general office email addresses.All questions should be submitted through the new inquiry form.
Effective immediately, the below email addresses will no longer be monitored:
  * ~~[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection),~~  
~~[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection),~~  
~~[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection),~~  
~~[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection), [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection),~~  
~~[[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)~~


The following emails will remain the active for the following populations:
  * [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection): For all J-1 Scholars
  * [[email protected]](https://international.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection): For all current international students studying   
in Toronto or Vancouver


Email, sent to OGS before today, will still receive a response and does not need to be resubmitted  
through the inquiry form.
Tips for using the OGS self-service portal:
  *     * Always log in with your Northeastern credentials for a more personalized experience. This will  
also lead to more accurate, timely responses.
    * Browse available knowledge articles in the portal for answers to frequently asked questions (and  
check back often as new articles will continuously be added!)
    * Include as much information as possible when submitting an inquiry for the OGS team to best  
advise you
    * Limit the number of inquiries you submit to OGS by including all your questions in the same  
form
    * Check on your open inquiries (also known as cases) and provide any follow up information  
through the “my cases” tab at the top of your portal rather than opening a new case

As a reminder, this change will not impact other services provided by OGS, including the availability of  
support via OGS’ main phone line for U.S.-based students or via visit to the Boston office in 354 Richards Hall.
We are looking forward to improving the services we offer to our international student population and  
thank you in advance for your patience and flexibility throughout this transition.
