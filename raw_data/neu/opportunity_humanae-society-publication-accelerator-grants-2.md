Program Overview
Humane Studies Fellowship (HSF) Publication Accelerator Grants provide $5,000 to support students and postdocs with an established publishing record who commit to submitting an article to a well-regarded journal within the next six months.
HSF awards give you access to other IHS opportunities including mentorship, job market support, in-person and online events, and much more. You’ll also get connected to our diverse community of scholars advancing the science of liberty.
Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis.
Awardee Expectations
Awardees are expected to:
  * Submit proof of submission, either as a solo author or first author, to a mainstream journal within six months of awards date
  * Submit their work for an IHS Paper Review within three months from the award date
  * Present their work at an online IHS event


This program is made possible in part by the generous support of the John Templeton Foundation. The ideas and opinions expressed in supported projects are those of the participant(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the John Templeton Foundation or the Institute for Humane Studies.

Up to $5,000
Eligibility
Applicants for Humane Studies Fellowship awards must be enrolled in an MA or PhD program or be undertaking a post-doctoral fellowship. Previous applicants and winners are welcome to apply. Prior participation in IHS programs is not required.
The fellowship is open to students and postdocs at any university. International students are eligible; however, preference is given to applicants who live or study in North America or the United Kingdom. Qualifying fields of study include economics, political science, philosophy, law, history, sociology, and similar disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. We generally do not fund research in the natural sciences, medicine, or engineering.
