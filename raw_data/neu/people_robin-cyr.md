## Biography
Robin Cyr is an accomplished professional with over 27 years of experience in research compliance, research administration, and leadership roles within academic and healthcare institutions. With a background in psychology and sociology, coupled with a range of certifications and memberships in industry associations, Cyr has demonstrated expertise in developing and overseeing compliance programs, leading multidisciplinary teams, and managing complex research operations. 
Cyr joined Northeastern in March 2020 as the inaugural vice provost for research administration. In this new role, Cyr was charged with leading Northeastern’s recently integrated Research Administration, Research Finance, and Research Compliance offices, collectively known as Northeastern University Research Enterprise Services, or NU-RES, as well as the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and the Human Research Protection Program. Cyr also assumed responsibility for the operations in the Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Complex. 
In August 2022, Cyr’s responsibilities expanded as she assumed oversight of the Office of Academic and Research Safety, which includes the Institutional Biosafety Committee and Radiation Safety. With the opening of EXP in August 2023, operations in Northeastern’s new state-of-the-art multidisciplinary research facility were the most recent addition to her portfolio. 
Since joining Northeastern, the research enterprise has grown from $160.2 million to $285 million and the staffing across the offices has increased from 30 full-time professionals to over 100. This unprecedented growth aligns with Northeastern’s global footprint increasing from seven campuses to 14.
