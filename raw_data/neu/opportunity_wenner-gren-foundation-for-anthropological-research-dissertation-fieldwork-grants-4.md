This grant program funds doctoral or thesis research that advances anthropological knowledge. Our goal is to support vibrant and significant work that furthers our understanding of what it means to be human. There is no preference for any methodology, research location, topic, or subfield. The Foundation particularly welcomes proposals that integrate two or more subfields and pioneer new approaches and ideas.
Duration
No fixed duration of the grant.
Funding
Up to $25,000.
Eligibility
  1. Applicants must be enrolled in a doctoral program (or equivalent, if outside the U.S.). Qualified students of any nationality or institutional affiliation may apply. Applicants must designate a dissertation advisor or other scholar from the same institution who will take responsibility for supervising the project.
To receive an award, applicants must fulfill all of their program’s doctoral degree requirements, other than the dissertation/thesis, before the start date listed on their application form.

Unsuccessful applicants are welcome to reapply. But as part of their resubmission, they must explain how they have addressed the reviewers’ concerns, along with any changes to their plans.
