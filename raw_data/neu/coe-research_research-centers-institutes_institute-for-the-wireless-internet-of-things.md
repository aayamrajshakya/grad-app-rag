#  Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things 
Northeastern’s [Institute for the Wireless Internet of Things](https://www.northeastern.edu/wiot/) is pioneering research in wireless systems and networks to make the next generation of Internet of Things a continuum of connected devices able to interact in new ways with people and the environment— from connected cars and drones, to implantable medical devices and smart communities.
  * Cross-Disciplinary Partnerships
Our approach is engineering-focused, but our unique model of collaborating with industry, government, and other academics has enabled us to convene more than 130 researchers across disciplines, including cybersecurity and resilience, to advance IoT technologies. The sharing of ideas, resources, and Northeastern’s state-of-the-art laboratory spaces helps speed discovery and add to its impact.
  * Industry Membership Program
The institute offers a novel industry membership program that provides corporate members opportunities for sponsored research, first rights to license on patents, and a pipeline of talent for co-op positions and full-time wireless IoT researchers and professionals.
  * PAWR Project Office
We serve as the academic lead for the Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research Project Office, a $100 million public-private partnership to build city-scale testbeds for advanced wireless technologies, digital ecosystems, and how they can power IoT in new ways.
