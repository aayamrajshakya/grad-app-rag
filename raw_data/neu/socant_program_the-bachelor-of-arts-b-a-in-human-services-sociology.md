#  Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) inHuman Services and Sociology
Students pursuing a combined degree in human services and sociology will integrate the theoretical understandings of these two fields to better understand organizational and group behavior and their implications for individuals and communities utilizing human services. The human services major prepares students for careers in social change by providing students with the theoretical and skill-based background necessary for practice and research. 
The sociology major prepares students to rigorously analyze the social, political, and economic spheres of society at the local and global levels. Students will develop a holistic understanding of preventative and reactive responses to social inequality and an understanding of how to impact change at the individual and structural levels. 
The combined major provides students with the conceptual and practical tools to understand how various features of society affect its members as well as how people create social change.
