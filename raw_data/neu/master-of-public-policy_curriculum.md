* * *
The Master of Public Policy (MPP) degree program consists of 40 semester hours (SH)
  * 28 semester hours of core courses (7 courses total)
  * 12 semester hours of electives


Full-time students can complete the requirements for graduation in as little as 1.5 years. For those who choose to complete optional cooperative education experience, they will graduate with a total of 41 or 42 semester hours based on the length of the co-op.
All core classes within the MPP curriculum are available online or offline, and students are welcome to move between modalities at their home campus (Boston, Arlington, or Oakland*). Both the online and on-campus courses reflect Northeastern University’s high standards for excellence and offer a dynamic, interactive experience. 
All online courses are asynchronous, so that students can complete coursework on their own schedules, but all work must be completed by specified deadlines each week.
*MPP students can take courses at the Oakland campus starting in Fall 2025
* * *
## Cooperative Education (Co-op)
Co-op is a signature offering of Northeastern’s MPP program. This optional experience allows students to get credit for full-time employment (minimum 32 hours/week) in a role related to public policy.
Northeastern partners with local organizations in the Boston, Arlington/Washington, D.C., and Oakland/Bay Area metro areas, national partners, and global employers to help students find placements. Throughout the co-op program, MPP faculty and staff are available to mentor students on their work experience.
Students can choose from the two co-op cycles: January–June or July–December. Co-op participants must take a required “[Experiential Integration](https://publicaffairs.northeastern.edu/master-of-public-policy/curriculum/#opt-co-op)” course.
* * *
## Internship
MPP students are required to take an internship of at least 225 hours. However, students can waive this requirement if they have substantial experience or are fully employed in positions relevant to their careers.
* * *
## Concentrations and Certificates
Students who want to take their public policy career path in a specific direction can focus their coursework with a concentration or a certificate.
Please note: Courses taken at Northeastern University outside of the College of Social Sciences and Humanities are subject to different tuition rates.
### Optional Concentration: Healthcare Management and Policy
This concentration builds in-depth knowledge of health policy and health-sector management for students seeking careers in public health, community health, hospital administration, health-service management, healthcare policy development, and more.

Themes addressed throughout the course include the role of science in environmental policy, tensions between environment and development in international environmental politics, and the scale and complexity of international environmental governance.
#####  Food Systems and Public Policy
Explores the public policy dimensions of the contemporary food system. Utilizes scholarly readings and case studies to assess the role of governing institutions and political actors in shaping the food supply; the effects of energy, transportation, and urban policies on food access; the ecological dimensions of food production; impacts of international trade regimes on global food trade; and the potential impacts of climate change on food security.
