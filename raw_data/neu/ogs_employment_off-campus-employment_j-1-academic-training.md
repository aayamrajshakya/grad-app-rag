#  Students Studying in The United States 
With Academic Training, eligible J-1 students can deepen their Northeastern experience with employment opportunities that relate to their field of study. 
##  Academic Training Explained 
Academic Training (AT) is an employment authorization granted to eligible J-1 Students. It is designed to complement their programs of study in the United States.
  * AT is authorized by the program sponsor
  * Students may engage in AT during their academic program and/or after the completion of their studies
  * AT can be paid or unpaid, but must be authorized regardless of compensation
  * The work must be directly related to the student’s field of study
  * The work must be commensurate with their level of education
  * The work must be in a fully in-person or hybrid position (with no more than 40% remote)
  * The total amount of AT cannot exceed the total length of the academic program
  * AT authorization is location and date specific. The employer’s name and address and the employment dates must be authorized in advance by an Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) in the Office of Global Services (OGS).


OGS recently provided a Post-AT Information Session in Spring 2025. You can find the recording of the session here to learn more about AT.
##  Pre-Completion vs. Post-Completion Academic Training 
Pre-completion AT takes place before the J-1 student completes all of their degree requirements. Post-Completion AT takes place after the J-1 student has completed all degree requirements.
##  Eligibility Requirements 
A J-1 student is eligible for Academic Training if they meet the following requirements:
  * Student has maintained valid J-1 status throughout their program
  * Student is in good academic standing or has successfully completed program of study
  * Student is proposing a training experience that is directly related to their field of study and has been approved by the academic advisor or Co-op coordinator
  * Student will not engage in a 100% remote academic training opportunity. Students may work remotely no more than 40% of the time (e.g., two days out of five in a standard work week) when their employers have instituted partial remote policies. Please see the June 2023 Department of State guidance directive for more information.
  * Student is maintaining health insurance coverage for themselves and any J-2 dependents


##  Time Limitations 
  * J-1 Undergraduate and Master’s Degree students are eligible for up to 18 months of AT; this includes both pre- and post-completion AT (pre-AT & post-AT) 
    * NOTE: through June 30, 2026, the Department of State is allowing extension up to 36 months (or length of degree program, whichever is shorter) for undergraduate and master’s degree level students in eligible STEM fields. Please contact OGS for more information
    * You may notice that your major as listed on the DS-2019 form may differ from your academic program name. This is not an error. Please note that this reflects the official Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) code and name for your program as Northeastern reports to the Department of Education. You can learn more about CIP Codes and the CIP Code assignment process at Northeastern University here.
  * J-1 Doctoral Degree students are eligible for up to 36 months of AT; this includes both Pre- and Post-AT.
  * J-1 Non-Degree Exchange Students are eligible for AT equivalent to their program duration, not to exceed a total program duration of 24 months.
  * The total AT period may not exceed the amount of time spent in a full course of study 
    * Example: A Master’s student who completed their program in 12 months is only eligible for 12 months of AT
    * Example: A Non-Degree Exchange student in a 9-Month Academic Year exchange program at Northeastern would be eligible for no moreno more
  * Post-AT time begins the day after the program end date listed on your DS-2019, whether you are working or not. 
    * Example: If your graduation date is 5/8/2019, you must start counting your post-AT time on 5/9/2019, even if you do not start working on that date
  * It is your responsibility to track your AT usage
  * Post-AT authorization must be processed before the graduation date on your DS-2019
  * Post-AT must begin within 30 days completion of your studies.


Please note: Both full and part-time AT deduct at a full-time rate. This means that, even if AT authorization is given for work done on a part-time basis, each day of part-time training deducts a full day from the total amount of time a student is eligible for AT.
##  Requesting Authorization 
###  To participate in an off-campus experiential learning opportunity in the U.S., J-1 Students must obtain AT authorization from OGS. All students must comply with their college's requirements and policies concerning the timing of eligibility for Co-op or other experiential learning opportunity. Please note that individual academic departments or colleges may have additional requirements and regulations for eligibility. OGS will not review any requests for AT that have not already been reviewed by the appropriate advisor. 
1  Meet with your academic or Co-op advisor to discuss your experiential learning opportunity. 
OGS will not review any requests that have not been approved by your academic or Co-op advisor.
2  Complete the Academic Training Authorization Request with your academic or Co-op advisor. 
The [Academic Training Authorization Request Form](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/academic-training-at-authorization-request-form/) can be found on the Office of Global Services website.

    * compensation (if paid, otherwise note the position is unpaid)
  * For post-completion AT only: if the salary is less than $2,334 per month, the student must submit additional financial documentation to meet the minimum funding requirements


4  Receive your DS-2019 with AT Authorization from an ARO in the Office of Global Services 
OGS will review the student’s request to determine whether or not the student is eligible to participate in AT. If denied, the student will need to resubmit the e-form after making appropriate adjustments to their application. Authorized students will receive an email to their Northeastern University email address with their digitally-signed DS-2019 and AT authorization letter for Social Security Number eligibility attached.
_PLEASE NOTE_
##  Important Post-Completion Academic Training Reminders 
  * Post-completion AT applications must be submitted at least 15 business days before 
  * Post-completion AT employment must begin within 30 days of your completion of studies (DS-2019 program end date). 
    * Example: If a student’s graduation date is 5/8/2024, work on post-completion AT would need to start by 6/7/2024.
  * You must maintain health insurance that meets the J-1 requirements for the entire duration of your academic training period.

Frequently Asked Questions »
##### Frequently Asked Questions
×
####  [ When do I need authorization? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/j-1-academic-training/#collapse-1)
This question is based off of what the U.S. government considers to be employment. Employment is considered work for compensation. Compensation can be monetary, but it can also be food, travel, lodging, or even beneficial experience. If you are benefiting from your participation in any way, you require authorization.
[](https://www.northeastern.edu/ogs/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Warning-Symbol.png) IMPORTANT: Just because an opportunity is unpaid does not mean it does not require authorization.
####  [ Do I need a valid visa to apply for Academic Training? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/off-campus-employment/j-1-academic-training/#collapse-2)
No. Visas are for entry purposes only. OGS does not require your visa to authorize AT.
