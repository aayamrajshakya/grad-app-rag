[The Ivanov Lab](https://ivanov.sites.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University is paving the way to a whole variety of diagnostic tests that are possible off of a single blood draw, including — someday — cancer.
Every cell in your body has a thin covering of carbohydrates called glycoconjugates — ”conjugates” as they’re formed when the carbohydrates are chemically connected to proteins, lipids and other cell surface molecules.
These carbohydrates — also called glycans — play a significant role in both cell communication and the cell’s ability to respond to disease.
For instance, says associate professor of chemistry and chemical biology [Alexander Ivanov](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/alexander-ivanov/), common blood type tests “are based on glycan analysis.”
