Northeastern University D’Amore-McKim School of Business’s [Graduate Certificate in Entrepreneurship](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/entrepreneurship-certificate/?utm_source=internal-referral&utm_medium=nu-catalog&utm_campaign=gce) is designed to help students learn how to launch a cutting-edge venture and develop a business plan for a high-potential idea. Students have an opportunity to build a strong foundation of business knowledge that includes product development, planning, and competitive strategies.
In just four courses—with the option to take a fifth course to deepen their knowledge base—students study core business skills and essential best practices for commercializing innovation in a digital economy. Depending on their chosen electives, students explore critical topics in greater depth, such as disruptive technologies, lean design, or financing.
