2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
The Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Engineering is offered jointly by Northeastern University's College of Engineering and Bouvé College of Health Sciences. The program prepares students with a fundamental understanding of pharmaceutical sciences and principles of engineering to develop the depth needed for advanced study of pharmaceutical engineering.
This program is generally pursued by students with a Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering or closely allied fields in engineering, sciences, or mathematics. The program was designed in collaboration with the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences to develop the depth needed for advanced study of pharmaceutical engineering. Students wishing to pursue the master’s degree with undergraduate educational backgrounds other than engineering are required to demonstrate completion of mathematics coursework through differential equations or the equivalent to be admitted. Prior completion of at least one semester of organic chemistry or the equivalent is also required, and some prior exposure to concepts in biochemistry and molecular biology is helpful. Students are advised to work closely with their advisors and instructors to determine the electives that would meet their career goals.
## Part-Time Students
Part-time students may progress according to their plans and time constraints but within the seven-year time limit. 
Master of Science students wishing to change their status from part time to full time must notify the chemical engineering department and make a formal petition to the Graduate School of Engineering. Refer to the regulations of the Graduate School of Engineering for further information on academic administrative policies.
Complete all courses and requirements listed below unless otherwise indicated.
