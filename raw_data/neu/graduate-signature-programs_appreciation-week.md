The Center for Student Involvement is proud to host Northeastern University’s Graduate and Professional Student Appreciation Week (GPSAW), which takes place in the first week of April every year on the Boston campus! GPSAW is a nationwide celebration of graduate and professional students held by many colleges and universities across the country.
We appreciate all of your contributions and dedication to the Northeastern University community. Without you, Northeastern would not be the world-class institution of higher learning that it is today. We are thrilled to celebrate all that you are: researchers, teachers, parents, scholars, scientists, artists, writers, creators, leaders, and everything in-between. You are at one of the best higher education institutions in the world surrounded by some of the brightest minds: you are exactly where you belong. Together, you all make up a vibrant, diverse tapestry from all corners of the globe. 
Thank you for coming, Huskies! The next GPSAW will be March 30 – April 3, 2026!
