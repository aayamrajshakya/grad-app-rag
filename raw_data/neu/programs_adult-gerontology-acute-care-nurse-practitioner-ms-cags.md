## The need for highly engaged and clinically excellent nurses has never been more profound.
The Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner program prepares nurses for advanced practice roles and to care for patients with acute, episodic and complex chronic illnesses in the acute care setting. The program culminates in the Master of Science degree in Nursing.
As a nurse practitioner, you will apply your skills through direct nursing care, consultation, collaboration, coordination, and referral. Your health care services will be provided in a variety of settings. Your practice will be patient-centered, collaborative, empathetic and evidence-based.

In addition to the traditional Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner Master’s program, we offer a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study (CAGS) for nurses who already possess an MS degree in Nursing.
Upon completion of the acute care program, graduates are eligible to sit for all national certification exams in their area of practice.
The program in which you are enrolled prepares you to practice in any state, based on the information posted on each state’s nursing licensure website. If you have questions or concerns regarding professional licensure, please contact program director [Stephen Wood](https://bouve.northeastern.edu/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#0675287169696246686974726e6367757263746828636273).

## Experiential Learning
Clinical practice of the advanced nurse is the major focus of this program. All students complete a minimum number of direct patient care hours of precepted clinical learning. Intensive supervision of clinical work by faculty and expert preceptors provides the necessary experience for practice, as well as an appreciation of the critical analysis as a method of learning. Through varied clinical experiences while working with expert clinicians, students develop the expertise necessary for patient management and advanced nursing practice skills across the wellness-illness continuum.
The School of Nursing has over 40 years of experience providing experiential learning opportunities for nursing students. Students consult with their faculty advisors to choose the appropriate clinical settings for their practicum experiences. Opportunities are available in locations throughout New England. The School of Nursing maintains affiliations with over 100 institutions in Greater Boston including:
  * Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
