# Welcome to the Social Impact Lab! We’re reimagining everything about how we conceptualize, teach, fund, and engage in social change. 
Welcome to the Social Impact Lab!
With the launch of our flagship experiential philanthropy program in 2008 and the founding of the Social Impact Lab in 2014, we made a commitment to advancing principles, practices, and pedagogy that prepare students to engage in the work of social change ethically and effectively and to hold themselves accountable to every individual and community whose life they may enter. We are deeply grateful to the many organizations and individuals who have partnered with SIL over the years and share our vision of “learning to make a difference in a complex world.” 
To the thousands of students across the globe who have been a part of this journey, a deeply heartfelt thank you. Your commitment to co-creating a more just and caring world is a constant source of joy and inspiration.
With gratitude,
Rebecca Riccio, Founder & Juffali Family Director of the Social Impact Lab
## What We Do
We engage students who aspire to make a difference in the world in experience-centered learning to develop three pillars of ethical and effective social change practice: Ways of Thinking, Ways of Being,  Ways of Doing
## Where We Work
We work with students and partners in the classroom, across campus, in the community, and around the world.
