Program overview 
##  Lead cutting-edge drug discovery 
The Master of Science in Pharmacology, offered by the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, provides a comprehensive knowledge of both the theoretical and applied aspects of pharmacology at all levels of biological organization, from the molecular to the living organism.
Through coursework, seminars, conferences, and off-campus internship experiences, students gain exposure to both classical and recent approaches that have led to the development of current theories of drug action and principles supporting drug discovery. Emphasis is placed on understanding how drug action elicits a therapeutic outcome and the safety and efficacy consequences associated with pharmacotherapeutics. After completion, you’ll also be well prepared to enter related PhD programs at the university. The program is STEM certified.
