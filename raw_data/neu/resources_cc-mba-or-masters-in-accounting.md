#  MBA or Master's in Accounting? Choosing the right degree for you 
Updated on: October 22, 2025
The demand for skilled financial professionals is rising in today's dynamic economy. An advanced degree in accounting provides career benefits such as readiness for leadership positions and specialization in areas like forensic and tax accounting. An advanced accounting degree can also fulfill CPA exam requirements, boosting earning potential and showcasing expertise. 
When considering paths for career progression in accounting, individuals often weigh the benefits of pursuing a [Master of Business Administration (MBA)](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/mba-full-time/) versus a [Master of Science in Accounting (MSA)](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-accounting/). While an MBA provides a broad business education focusing on leadership, an MSA offers specialized knowledge in accounting principles. However, for recent graduates or career changers without an undergraduate background in accounting, a [dual MSA/MBA](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/programs/ms-accounting-mba/) program is also an option. 
In this article, we will compare these degrees to help you decide which accounting degree is right for you. 
## What are the core differences between an MBA and an MS in Accounting? 
An MBA provides a broad business education focusing on leadership, strategy, and management skills. In contrast, an MS in Accounting offers specialized knowledge in accounting principles, preparing students for auditing, taxation, and financial reporting roles. 
### Program focus: MS in Accounting vs. MBA 
An MS in Accounting degree typically offers a specialized accounting curriculum aligned with the Certified Public Accountant (CPA) exam, focusing on advanced accounting principles, auditing, taxation, and financial reporting. 
An MBA curriculum emphasizes business management, covering areas such as leadership, strategy, marketing, and finance. 
While both degrees provide valuable skills, an MBA offers a broader business perspective, while an MS in Accounting delves deeply into accounting expertise. 
### Program length: MS in Accounting vs. MBA 
An MS in Accounting typically takes 12 to 24 months to complete, while an MBA program usually lasts around 18 to 24 months. Both programs can offer accelerated programs (with timelines as short as 7 months) or flexible part-time programs, which can shorten or extend the amount of time it takes to complete your degree. 
Generally shorter than an MBA, an MS in Accounting degree provides quicker entry into the workforce and is ideal for those seeking an accounting specialization such as auditing, financial analyst, forensic accounting, or tax accounting. Conversely, the longer MBA program offers a comprehensive business education that benefits leadership roles in various industries such as consulting, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship. Ultimately, the choice depends on career goals and desired specialization. 
### Coursework: MS in Accounting vs. MBA 
Both MS in Accounting and MBA coursework cover key business concepts, but they differ in focus and depth. 
The coursework for an MS in Accounting typically includes advanced accounting topics such as auditing, taxation, financial reporting, and forensic accounting. Innovative curriculums may incorporate analytics into courses, equipping you for the forefront of big data accounting as technology continues to transform the industry. Courses may also cover subjects like accounting information systems, managerial accounting, and ethics. The focus is on providing students with specialized knowledge and skills relevant to accounting roles. 
An MBA program covers a broad spectrum of business topics including finance, marketing, operations, strategy, and leadership. Coursework may delve into areas such as financial management, marketing strategy, operations management, and organizational behavior. Many programs offer concentrations or specializations, allowing students to focus on specific areas of interest. Concentrations in finance might include courses on investment analysis and corporate finance, while marketing concentrations could involve classes on consumer behavior and brand management. 
Coursework in MBA and MS in Accounting programs may overlap in topics such as finance and managerial accounting, but the depth of coverage and focus differ between the two programs. The MS in Accounting delves deeply into accounting principles and practices, while the MBA offers a broader view of business management. 
### Prerequisites: MS in Accounting vs. MBA 
When comparing prerequisites for an MBA and an MS in Accounting, both programs require foundational business knowledge, but their specific requirements and emphasis on work experience differ significantly. 
Prerequisites for an MS in Accounting often include a bachelor's degree in accounting or a related field, with coursework in financial accounting, managerial accounting, auditing, and taxation. Some programs may also require applicants to have completed specific business courses as prerequisites, such as finance or economics. Work experience may not be a strict prerequisite for admission to an MS in Accounting program, but relevant experience in accounting or finance can strengthen an application. 
Prerequisites for an MBA program can vary widely depending on the institution and the specific program. Some MBA programs may require applicants to have a bachelor's degree in business or a related field, while others may admit students from diverse academic backgrounds. Business courses such as accounting, finance, economics, and statistics are often recommended but may not be mandatory prerequisites. Work experience is typically valued for MBA applicants, with many programs preferring candidates who have several years of professional experience. 
### Program eligibility: MS in Accounting vs. MBA 
When comparing program eligibility for an MS in Accounting and an MBA, both programs seek applicants with strong academic backgrounds, but their preferences for work experience differ. 
Competitive applicants for an MS in Accounting often have a strong academic background in accounting or a related field and some relevant work experience in accounting or finance. However, work experience requirements may vary depending on the program, as some programs are tailored toward recent graduates with a bachelor's in accounting. 
Competitive applicants for an MBA program typically have several years of professional experience, preferably in management or leadership roles. While some MBA programs may admit candidates with limited work experience, those with significant work experience often have a competitive advantage in the admissions process. Additionally, applicants with diverse backgrounds and experiences may also be valued for their unique perspectives and contributions to the MBA learning environment. 
### How do potential career paths differ for an MS in Accounting vs. an MBA? 
The potential career paths for individuals with an MS in Accounting versus an MBA vary significantly. 
An [MS in Accounting typically prepares students for specialized roles](https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/resources/cc-choosing-the-best-masters-degree-for-your-accounting-career/) in accounting and finance, such as auditor, tax accountant, forensic accountant, and financial analyst. A Master's in Accounting degree also provides the necessary education to become a Certified Public Accountant (CPA), which is often required for certain accounting positions. 
An MBA offers a broader range of career options across various industries and functions, including management consulting, finance, marketing, operations, and entrepreneurship. MBA graduates often pursue leadership roles in these areas, leveraging their business acumen and management skills. 
The decision between pursuing an MS in Accounting or an MBA may also depend on a student's current career trajectory and goals. A student with an accounting or finance background may choose to pursue an MS in Accounting to deepen their expertise and advance within the field. Students aiming to transition into a management or leadership role, or explore opportunities outside of accounting, may decide to pursue an MBA to broaden their skill set and career prospects. 
To combine the best of both worlds, there's the option for individuals to pursue both degrees sequentially or concurrently, known as a Master's in Accounting/MBA dual degree program. This path is particularly attractive for career changers seeking to transition into accounting or finance from a different field, as it provides a comprehensive education in both business management and accounting principles. The decision to pursue an MS in Accounting, an MBA, or a dual MSA/Accounting degree depends on individual career goals, background, and professional growth and development aspirations.

## Is an MS in Accounting/MBA dual degree better than an MS in Accounting or an MBA? 
An MS in Accounting/MBA dual degree can offer more advantages than pursuing either degree alone, depending on your career goals. An MS in Accounting/MBA dual degree combines specialized accounting knowledge with broad business management skills, preparing students for leadership roles in both fields and offering a comprehensive skill set and greater career flexibility. 
Eligibility typically requires a strong academic background in accounting, business, or a related field, along with relevant work experience. For those with an undergraduate degree in accounting, an MS in Accounting may be more straightforward, especially for CPA certification. However, an MBA or a dual degree may be more beneficial for those aiming for broader business management roles. 
Ultimately, the best choice depends on your career goals and existing qualifications. A dual degree provides maximum flexibility and opportunities in both accounting and business management. 
## How do I choose the right graduate business program for me?
