#  Students Studying in The United States

Please read the information below carefully to review the process and determine your eligibility. 
##  What is a SEVIS Transfer? 
A SEVIS transfer is the process of moving your SEVIS record from your current school (Northeastern) to another SEVP-certified school in the U.S. after you’ve received an offer of admission.
If you are an F-1 or J-1 student who is leaving or completing your current degree program or ending a period of approved Post-OPT/STEM OPT/AT, you may be eligible to request a SEVIS transfer. Please review eligibility requirements and the process to request a SEVIS transfer on this page.
##  F-1 Transfer Eligibility 
  * Continuously maintain your F-1 student status
  * Gain admission to an SEVP-Certified Institution in the U.S.
  * Request a SEVIS transfer before the conclusion of your grace period if you have already completed your academic program 
    * If you request a SEVIS transfer without completing a program of study at Northeastern, OGS must receive your SEVIS transfer request prior to your withdrawal
    * If you request a SEVIS transfer in the middle of an academic term you must maintain F-1 student status with full-time enrollment and on-ground presence until your SEVIS record has been transferred out
  * Enroll in your new institution for the next available program start date or no more than 5 months after your last date of enrollment at NU/your last day of Post-OPT
