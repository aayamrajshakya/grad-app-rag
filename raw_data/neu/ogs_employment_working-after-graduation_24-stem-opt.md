#  Students Studying in The United States 
F-1 students who receive Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degrees and meet the requirements below may be eligible to apply for a 24-month extension of their Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). 
###  Applicants for STEM OPT Remain Eligible for Automatic 180-day Extension 
On October 29, 2025, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an interim final rule that ends the practice of automatically extending employment authorization documents (EADs) for certain categories of individuals who apply for renewal. This change does not impact F-1 alumni applying for the STEM OPT extension. Please review "DHS Ends Automatic EAD Extensions for Certain Applicants" under Current Students > Important Updates on the OGS website.
###  Changes to Paper Filing Payment Options Starting October 28, 2025 
Effective October 28th, 2025, USCIS is no longer accepting personal checks, money orders, or bank checks as payment for paper I-765 application fees. Please refer to the “Application Process” section below for updated fee payment instructions.
##  What is the STEM OPT Extension? 
The 24-month STEM OPT Extension is a type of employment authorization adjudicated by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). It is available to eligible F-1 students for the purpose of gaining practical experience directly related to their program of study. A STEM Extension application requires a student to be on an approved period of Post-Completion OPT, to have an E-verify employer that provides a student with formal training and learning, a STEM OPT recommendation on the Form I-20, then a timely application to USCIS for final adjudication. If successful, USCIS will issue an Employment Authorization Document (EAD) granting the student 24-months of work authorization.
##  Eligibility 
#### All four of the below criteria must be met in order for a student to be eligible for the 24-month Optional Practical Training extension:
  1. Students who are on Post-Completion OPT; and
  2. Who have earned a bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD (certificate programs are not eligible) in a field included on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s list of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields within the last 10 years (see below for more details about how to find out if your degree is STEM designated); and
  3. Who are employed for a minimum of 20 hours/week in a paid job directly related to their field of study; and
  4. Who are working for an employer that is enrolled in the [U.S. Government’s E-Verify program.](https://www.e-verify.gov/)


#### STEM Designated Degrees
To verify STEM eligibility, look at the code listed under “Primary Major” on Page 1 of your I-20 and compare that code in the Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) column of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security [STEM Designated Degree Programs](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/stemList2024.pdf) list. If your major code is on the list, then it is considered to be STEM eligible.
You can learn more about [CIP Codes and the CIP Code assignment process at Northeastern University here.](https://service.northeastern.edu/registrar?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB000019876&sys_kb_id=1380e9fe33f15ed0069dd1355d5c7b5c#mcetoc_1icm7ch17j5)
Please note: the DHS STEM Designated Degree Programs list was recently updated on July 22, 2024. Please be sure you are accessing the most recent STEM list linked above, which can also be found on the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement website on [this page](https://www.ice.gov/sevis/schools) in the “Resources” section under the “DHS STEM Designated Degree Program List and CIP Code Nomination Process” tab. No students at Northeastern University were impacted by the update.
Important Note for Alumni with an Approved Cap-Gap Extension
F-1 alumni with an approved Cap-Gap Extension may be eligible to apply for the STEM OPT Extension as long as USCIS receives their application before the expiration of their Post-OPT EAD. However, if your Post-OPT EAD end date is already in the past (even if you have received a Cap-Gap Extension), an application for the STEM OPT Extension is likely to be denied by USCIS. 
Please [review the information on the H-1B and the Cap-Gap Extension page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/cap-gap-extension/#:~:text=CAN%20I%20APPLY%20FOR%20THE%20STEM%20EXTENSION%20DURING%20THE%20CAP%2DGAP%20EXTENSION%20PERIOD%3F) of our website for more details.
##  STEM Extension Application Timeline 
Students may apply to USCIS for the STEM OPT Extension work authorization no earlier than 90 days prior to the Post-OPT EAD expiration date.
Completed applications must be received by USCIS within 60 days of the STEM OPT recommendation date and prior to the expiration date on the Post-Completion OPT EAD to be properly (timely) filed. USCIS will not accept applications for the STEM Extension that are received beyond the expiration date of the Post-OPT EAD.
##  COMPLETING THE FORM I-983 
All students must submit a [completed Form I-983](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/i983.pdf) to OGS in order to receive the STEM OPT Extension recommendation on their Form I-20. Students should reference the official [USCIS Instructions of the Form I-983](https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/i983Instructions.pdf) and the [resources available on the Study in the States website](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/stem-opt-hub/additional-resources/form-i-983-overview) as they complete the I-983.
Additionally, OGS has prepared a supplemental guide to filling out the Form I-983 to assist students as they complete their application for the STEM OPT Extension. Because the STEM OPT Extension application is a personal petition to USCIS, OGS is unable to advise on how to complete each section of the form.
Please Note:

####  [ Step 4: (Optional) Premium Processing ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46791232-4)
In 2023, USCIS introduced the availability of [Premium Processing](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/how-do-i-request-premium-processing) for F-1 students submitting the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days.
Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS.
Notes from OGS
  * Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process
  * Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time
  * OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS

##  USCIS Review of Publicly Available Social Media 
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may review publicly available social media content in connection with certain applications. This may include applications submitted by F-1 students for benefits such as OPT, STEM OPT Extension, or change of status. These reviews are intended to support eligibility verification and national security screening. For more, visit [USCIS.gov](https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-to-begin-screening-aliens-social-media-activity-for-antisemitism).
Within their review, USCIS will also consider if the applicant has demonstrated “Anti-American” or “Antisemitic” activity. You can review OGS’ [USCIS Policy Changes page](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/uscis-policy-changes/) for more information.
##  Mailing your application to USCIS (if not applying online) 
###  USCIS recommends filing online. However, if you choose to file your application with USCIS via a mail service, please review these instructions. 
####  [ Guidance for Mailing a STEM OPT Extension Application to USCIS ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46863242-1)
We strongly recommend that you make copies of your complete application for your records before mailing your application to USCIS.
Once you have your documents and I-20 for the 24-month STEM extension, and you have copied all documentation and assembled the packet, you must send it to the USCIS address below. However, its always best practice to confirm the most up-to-date [USCIS Direct Filing Addresses for Form I-765](https://www.uscis.gov/i-765-addresses) directly on the USCIS website. It is recommended that you mail your STEM packet via certified/guaranteed mail and obtain a receipt with tracking number.
Mail your application to the USCIS Chicago lockbox:

> Chicago, IL 60603-5517
eShipGlobal Mailing Option:
[eShipGlobal offers a shipping service](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/opt-mailing-process-and-instructions/) for international students sending their OPT/STEM application to USCIS. Students can choose their carrier (UPS, FedEx, or USPS) and type of delivery (next day, 2-day, etc.) and ship at discounted rates. This service is not a Northeastern service. All inquiries should be directed to eShipGlobal directly.
USCIS Processing Times:
  * USCIS advertises normal processing time for STEM OPT requests as being around 100 days.
  * You can [check current processing times on USCIS’s website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)


After the documentation leaves the respective Lockbox, it is forwarded to the USCIS Service Center. About fifteen days after USCIS receives your application for the 24-month OPT extension, you should receive a Form I-797, a receipt notice from USCIS.
##  What happens after I submit my application to USCIS? 
###  Remember, as long as you timely filed your application with USCIS, you may continue working for up to 180 days (6 months) while your application is pending!* 
####  [ Receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS and wait for adjudication ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-1)
  * You should receive a receipt notice (Form I-797) from USCIS. You can look up your case status [online](https://egov.uscis.gov/casestatus/landing.do) using the case number. 
    * If you file online you will receive this receipt notice electronically within a day or two. If you file by mail you should receive this notice within 2-weeks.
  * You can check USCIS current OPT and STEM OPT estimated processing times on the [USCIS website](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/). (Select Form: “I-765” Form Category: “Based on a request by a qualified F-1 academic student [(c)(3)]” Service Center: “Potomac Service Center”.)
  * While your STEM OPT application is pending, you may continue working for up to 180 days (6 months)*


*The Code of Federal Regulations, 8CFR 214.2(f)(11)(i)(C) and 8CFR 247a.12(c)(6)(iv), automatically extend your work authorization while the application is pending. However, you must have already submitted all the appropriate documentation to USCIS and paid the filing fee prior to the expiration date of your Post-Completion OPT.
####  [ Wait for your Approval Notice and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-2)

####  [ Can I travel outside of the U.S. while my application with USCIS is pending? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-3)
If your STEM OPT application is pending with USCIS and you plan to travel abroad, please make sure your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document (EAD) is still valid. If your Post-OPT EAD is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT recommended while your STEM application is still pending with USCIS.
####  [ Can I change my employer while my application with USCIS is pending? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-4)
Changing employers while your STEM OPT application is pending can cause delays and complications, so it is generally not recommended. However, if that you do need to change your employer while your application is pending, the new employer must also be enrolled in the [E-Verify program](https://www.e-verify.gov/) and the position must meet all STEM requirements. Please review “Changing Employers During the STEM Extension” and select Changing Employers while the STEM Extension is Pending with USCIS for more information. 
####  [ Can I apply for Premium Processing while my application with USCIS is pending? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-5)
F-1 students can request premium processing while their Form I-765 is Pending with USCIS. You can [learn more about Premium Processing on the USCIS website.](https://www.uscis.gov/forms/all-forms/how-do-i-request-premium-processing)
####  [ I received a Request for Evidence (RFE). What should I do next? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46875161-6)
If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the [STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/forms-and-guides/stem-opt-issue-reporting-form/)
Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided.
RFE Review Process
All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on:
  * The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents
  * The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation
  * The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official)
  * The due date of the RFE

##  Responsibilities During the STEM OPT Extension 
####  [ Reporting Employment during STEM OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46924135-1)
#### It is the responsibility of the student to determine if the potential employment is related to their program of study and to timely report all employment to OGS via the appropriate e-form. You can [learn more on our STEM OPT Employment Reporting page.](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/)
####  [ Traveling During STEM OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46924135-2)
If you travel outside the U.S. or its territories during the approved STEM OPT extension period, to re-enter the country, you must present the following documents at the port of entry:
  * A passport which should be valid for at least six months from the date you return to the U.S. and your unexpired F-1 visa stamp
  * I-20 with a valid travel signature (While you are participating in OPT, travel signatures are valid for only 6 months)
  * Your Employment Authorization Document card for STEM OPT extension*
  * Proof of employment 
    * If you are not currently employed, you should not travel outside of the U.S. as you may be denied entry by Customs and Border Protection (CBP)


*If your STEM OPT application is pending and you plan to travel abroad, please make sure your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is still valid. If your Post-OPT Employment Authorization Document is already expired, traveling abroad is NOT
If you travel during your OPT or STEM period and your F-1 visa has expired, you will need to obtain a new F-1 visa. While on OPT/STEM, you are still considered to be an F-1 student. Expect to show similar documents as the first time you applied for your visa (check with your local US embassy for requirements). Additionally, you should have your valid STEM EAD card, I-20 with STEM recommendation on page 2 and travel signature within 6 months, passport valid within 6 months, and proof of employment. Please see [Renewing your F-1 visa](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/) for further instructions on how to renew your visa.
####  [ Studying During STEM OPT ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-46924135-3)
While recreational or avocational study is permissible during the STEM OPT extension, students cannot pursue a degree-seeking program while simultaneously working on the STEM Extension. You should speak with a DSO in OGS to make sure your study qualifies. U.S. Federal Regulations state that employment authorization is automatically terminated when a student begins study at another education level or transfers to another school.

##### Frequently Asked Questions
×
####  [ There is a problem with my OPT Application/EAD and I need help. What should I do? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-1)
Check out OGS’ knowledge base article on how to resolve common OPT/STEM OPT application and EAD card issues.
####  [ Am I eligible for the STEM Extension based on a previous degree? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-2)
Students may be eligible to apply for the STEM Extension based on a previously earned STEM degree from an accredited U.S. institution (must be within 10 years of completing the degree).
For example: A student receives a bachelor’s degree in Engineering, but did not request STEM OPT employment authorization based on that degree. The student then receives an MBA and obtains authorization for 12-months of Post-OPT based on the MBA. This student may be eligible to apply for 24-month STEM OPT at the end of the 12-month Post-OPT period based on their MBA.
Any students that believe they are eligible for STEM based on a previous degree should make an appointment with an OGS advisor.
####  [ Can I be authorized for the STEM OPT Extension more than once? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-3)
The 24-month extension of OPT is available to each student at two non-consecutive periods of time.
Please note: This rule is different from the “standard” 12-month OPT, under which students can be approved for multiple OPT periods for each higher degree earned in the U.S. (i.e. bachelor’s, then master’s, then doctoral).
####  [ What is the E-Verify program? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-4)
E-Verify is a database system operated by the Department of Homeland Security in partnership with the Social Security Administration. It allows participating employers to electronically verify the employment eligibility of newly-hired employees. E-Verify is currently voluntary in most states.[ For more information click here.](https://www.e-verify.gov/)
####  [ Can I work while my 24-month application is pending with USCIS? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-5)
Yes, a student who files a timely STEM OPT extension application can continue working while the STEM OPT application is pending, for up to 180 days beyond the expiration of the student’s standard post-completion OPT. All work done during this 180-day time period is considered STEM OPT extension time that counts towards the 24-month total.
####  [ Can I change employers while my application is pending with USCIS? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-6)
It should be noted that changing your employer while applying for STEM can potentially create delays in the application process. However, if you need to change employers while your STEM application is pending with USCIS, please review the instructions in the [Reporting](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/reporting-stem-opt/) STEM Extension OPT section.
####  [ Can I apply for STEM OPT extension if I have a pending H-1B application? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/working-after-graduation/24-stem-opt/#collapse-7)
Yes, you may apply for the 24 month OPT STEM extension while you are also in your period of Cap Gap extension.
If you choose to continue on your 24 month extension rather than change to H-1B, you must ensure your employer requests the withdrawal of your H- 1B petition prior to its effective date. If this is not done, your H-1B status will begin on its effective date, and your eligibility for the 24 month STEM extension will be cancelled.
If you choose to change to H-1B and not proceed with your 24 month STEM extension application, you should send a letter to the USCIS service center reviewing your application and request that your STEM application is withdrawn. Your letter should include your name, SEVIS ID, receipt number, reason for withdrawal, and your signature (in ink).
