#  ElizabethBucar
Professor of Religion; Dean's Leadership Fellow 
Liz Bucar is a leading expert in religious ethics. Her research and writing covers a wide range of topics—from sexual reassignment surgery to the politics of religious clothing–but generally focuses on how a deeper understanding religious difference can change our sense of what is right and good. She is the author of four books, including her most recent, Stealing My Religion: Not Just Any Cultural Appropriation (Harvard 2022) and the award-winning Pious Fashion: How Muslim Women Dress (Harvard, 2017). At Northeastern Bucar teaches courses on sexual ethics, Islam, cultural appropriation, and the popular comparative religion program in Spain that includes a 150-mile hike on the Camino. Her public scholarship has appeared in The Atlantic, The Los Angeles Times, and Teen Vogue. Bucar is Director of Sacred Writes: Public Scholarship on Religion, a grant-funded project that provides support, resources, and networks for scholars of religion committed to translating the significance of their research to a broader audience.

## Courses

### Selling Spirituality
#### PHIL 1133
Focusing on two popular practices–yoga and meditation–this course explores the ethics of western commodification of eastern spiritual practices. Topics covered include; whether cultural appropriation applies to spiritual/religious borrowings; debates over whether yoga or meditation are properly understood as religious, philosophical, or something else; how and to whom these practices are marketed; and what ethical harms are created by the mindfulness industry. This course includes readings, informal and formal research and writing assignments, and experiential mindfulness learning assignments. The student will learn how to think critically about the marketing of mindfulness as universal and secular. PHIL 1133 is required for NU’s Mindfulness Minor. Course Attributes: NUpath Interpreting Culture (IC) and NUpath Engaging Difference and Diversity (DD).
