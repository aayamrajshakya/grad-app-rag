Princewill Umeh’s journey is one of transformation. Born in Nigeria and raised in the Bronx, Princewill took an unexpected turn in his career path when he switched from finance to computer science—a decision driven by his desire to create, build, and challenge himself.
“I felt like I reached that breaking point of not learning as much,” Princewill recalls of his time working at JP Morgan. Despite the valuable experience he gained during his two years in the bank’s development training program, he wanted more. “I wasn’t growing as much as I wanted to grow. I wanted a new challenge.”
## The drive to build
Princewill’s passion for creation has always been present. “Every day I wake up, I write down two ideas in my notebook—apps I want to build, ways I envision things getting better,” he explains. But without the technical skills to bring those ideas to life, he found himself stuck in the idea phase. That’s when the decision to pursue computer science became clear.
“I knew I had to develop my technical capabilities,” he says. Now enrolled in Northeastern’s [online Align MS in Computer Science program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/programs/mscs-computer-science-align/master-of-science-in-computer-science-align-online/), he’s gaining the essential skills needed to thrive in today’s tech-driven world. The Align program—designed for professionals without STEM backgrounds—starts with an intensive year of foundational courses before transitioning into advanced master’s-level coursework that prepares students for dynamic careers in the field.
## Why Northeastern University?
For Princewill, the [co-op program](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/academics-outcomes/our-learning-model/experiential-learning/) was a major draw. “The big selling point was actually the co-op,” he says. With friends who had successfully transitioned into high-level tech roles through Northeastern’s program, he saw the potential for himself. “Northeastern’s partnerships with local companies and their number one ranking in co-ops really stood out to me.”
His goal is clear: “I want to transition into the startup space. For my internship, I’d definitely want to work for a fintech startup.” And as he attends Northeastern’s Align identity seminars, he’s finding his path becoming even more defined. “The more I go to the identity seminars, the more I see myself in product management.”

## Finding community in Arlington
Although he’s now rooted in Arlington, Virginia, Princewill still carries the energy of New York with him. “I’ve been here for two years, and I love it. Arlington feels like home to me,” he says. The green spaces, soccer fields, and accessibility to Washington, D.C., make the area an ideal spot for someone like Princewill, who enjoys an active lifestyle. “I don’t find it difficult to find a soccer park around here, and everything’s very clean and safe.”
The [Northeastern campus in Arlington](https://graduate.northeastern.edu/global-campus-network/arlington-campus/) also offers a sense of community and growth. “Every day feels new,” he says, describing the ever-evolving campus atmosphere. “Even when I don’t have classes, I still want to come to campus. There’s a lot of space to study and even relax.”
## From finance to the future
Switching from economics and finance to tech might seem like a leap, but for Princewill, it’s a natural progression. “I love math and logic,” he says, reflecting on his decision to switch from international studies to economics during his undergrad years at American University. But tech, he believes, is where he can truly bring his ideas to life.
Now, as he builds his skills and expands his network at Northeastern, Princewill is excited about the future. “I’m proud to be a Husky. It’s not easy—the program is not easy—but I know that I made the right investment.”
His message for anyone considering a similar leap? “You have to be comfortable being uncomfortable,” he says. “I’m putting in the work now to get the right opportunities.”
