This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. 
What’s your name, the program you are currently receiving your degree in, and expected graduation date?
My name is Aditi Doshi. I just finished my fourth semester for the MS in Biotechnology, with a concentration in Enterprise. I will graduate in May 2024 and start my co-op at Moderna in January!
Who is one COS faculty or staff member that has made in influence in your experience?
Professor Christa Dhimo has significantly impacted my experience throughout my academic journey at Northeastern, as well as through some of the extra-curriculars I have been involved in. Christa was my professor for The Biotech Enterprise during my first semester here, and she opened my eyes to the possibilities outside of core research in biotech. I’m amazed at the potential opportunities out there, including those in patient access, clinical trial management, and market analysis, to name a few.
She also served as an advisor for the student organization I’m engaged with, the Graduate Women in Science and Engineering. Through her guidance, I’ve been actively working towards my aspiration of bridging the gap between scientific innovation and market implementation. Her support has been instrumental in navigating the challenges and complexities of this journey.
What is your favorite part about being in the master’s program at Northeastern?
I love the flexibility we’re offered at Northeastern when choosing our subjects. I did my bachelor’s in Biotechnology, and I wanted my Master’s to give me the chance to try things outside of my core field. This program gave me the flexibility to choose electives from various streams. For example, during my last semester, I took the Biotechnology Applications Lab offered by COS and Acquisitions Alliances and Growth offered by DMSB. The subjects are poles apart, but it’s been fascinating to learn how they are relevant within biotech. I’ve also enjoyed taking classes with people from so many different programs within Northeastern and understanding how differences in perspective can change the way you think.
How has hands-on research in labs enhanced your future career aspirations?
I mentioned before that I took the Biotech Applications Lab in my final semester. This was a minor requirement because I took the Enterprise concentration. I chose to accept the lab course because it would give me a good look at the cutting-edge technologies and techniques used in labs, shaping our future in biotech. Taking this course was one of the best decisions I made. I got to learn techniques to produce high-quality, reproducible research, and even tried my hand at some unique technologies like CRISPR!
As I transition into the business side of biotech, my hands-on research experience in the lab has instilled in me a profound appreciation for the meticulous and rigorous nature of biotech research. This first-hand understanding of the challenges and intricacies of lab work will undoubtedly give me a unique perspective that bridges the scientific and business aspects of the biotech industry.
Which has been your favorite co-ops/internships and why?
I had the opportunity to do my pre-co-op as a Global Strategy Development intern with Huwel Lifesciences, a medical device manufacturer. My favorite part of the internship was being able to apply all that I had learned at Northeastern to the work I was doing. I think going out on co-op and practicing what you’ve learned and applying it to a real-world setting is a very rewarding experience, and it really validates the time and effort you put into pursuing your graduate degree.
Who or what was your biggest inspiration to pursue a graduate degree?
I decided to pursue my masters when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. Witnessing the global impact of the pandemic shed light on the critical role of the biotech industry in addressing public health challenges. This realization, coupled with my fascination for the remarkable advancements in biotechnology, made me determined to delve deeper into the field through a master’s program.
What drew you to complete your MS degree at Northeastern?
I love the Northeastern co-op program because it helps you apply your knowledge. That and the fact that Northeastern is based in Boston helped me narrow down what university I wanted to attend. I love Boston for its beautiful seasons and for being surrounded by ambitious students from various universities. It’s a thriving environment. In addition, Boston is considered the world’s leading Biotech hub, and I just couldn’t miss out on the opportunity to be in a city so relevant to my passion.
What are your plans for the spring semester?
This spring, I go out on co-op at Moderna, a biotech company based in Cambridge. I will be joining the Commercial team and will be focusing on the launch of their RSV vaccine in emerging markets around the globe. I’m excited about the work I get involved in and meet new people worldwide!

What is a piece of advice you have for new students?
Try to be involved in as much as you can at Northeastern! There is so much happening all around, all the time. I have had the privilege of joining the Graduate Leadership Institute offered by Lead360 at Northeastern. I currently serve as Co-President of the Graduate Women in Science and Engineering (GWiSE) student organization. These experiences, outside of my core program at Northeastern, have helped me grow so much as a person and have taught me things that no academic program could ever have. Seize the opportunities that come your way!

What is a typical day in your life?
There is no typical day! I have loved that about the graduate experience. I work on campus around my class timings and help organize and attend events for the student organization I’m a part of. I love exploring Boston and trying new foods in my free time.
Where is your favorite spot to study?
Cullinane Hall is my favorite spot to study! It’s quiet, and there are multiple private rooms with whiteboards and comfy seats- the perfect environment for studying.
Where is your favorite spot to get breakfast/lunch/dinner near or on campus?
Tatte for the win! Their menu changes according to the season, and they always have the most wholesome, nourishing food.
