#  New U.S. Visa Screening Procedures 
June 23, 2025 
The U.S. Department of State (DoS) has announced expanded vetting of “online presence” for all F and J visa applicants, including students and exchange visitors. As part of this consular process, applicants are required to:
  * Disclose all social media identifiers on the DS-160 visa application
  * Set their social media profiles to “public” for consular review


Media reports based on a cable from the Secretary of State indicate that consular officers will be required to review applicants’ online presence for “any indications of hostility towards the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States”. Reports also state that that consular officers should flag “advocacy for, aid or support for foreign terrorists, and other threats to U.S. national security” and “support for unlawful antisemitic harassment or violence”.

Note: OGS continues to advise that current students, scholars, and alumni on OPT/STEM/AT do not travel for the sole purpose of visa renewal.
