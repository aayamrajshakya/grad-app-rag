Program overview 
##  Lead the future of robotics 
The Master of Science in Robotics at Northeastern is an interdisciplinary program jointly offered by the Khoury College of Computer Sciences and the College of Engineering. It explores this dynamic field from four interconnected perspectives: mechanical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, and biomedical and rehabilitation engineering.
Students select a concentration and develop a comprehensive understanding of the algorithms, sensors, control systems, and mechanisms that drive robotics. This integrated approach equips graduates to stand out in the field and make a transformative impact on society.
