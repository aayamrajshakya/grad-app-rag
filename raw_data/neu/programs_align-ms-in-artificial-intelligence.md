Break into artificial intelligence from any background and future-proof your career. You’ll begin by developing a foundation in computer science alongside supportive peers learning computer science for the first time. Then you’ll dive into machine learning, vision, intelligent interaction, robotics and agent systems, or knowledge management and reasoning. You can also opt for a paid co-op or internship with one of 800-plus employer partners. In as little as 2.5 years, you’ll be ready to create human-centered responsible AI.

## Career prospects and top employers
Demand for AI skills is high. About 1 million new AI and machine learning positions are expected globally over the next five years ([Final Round AI, 2025](https://www.finalroundai.com/blog/highest-paying-ai-jobs-in-2025)). The strategic nature and compensation of AI jobs are also increasing. In fact, 75% of employers prefer advanced degrees for AI leadership roles ([HR Drive](https://www.hrdive.com/news/AI-jobs-masters-degrees/720285)). The Align MS in AI qualifies you for strategic, high-paying AI roles.   
  
Align graduates move into AI roles like machine learning engineer, natural language processing engineer, computer vision engineer, AI software developer, AI product manager, data scientist, and AI consultant. 
Khoury College connects you to a network of more than 800 employer partners for co-ops and internships across North America, including Amazon, Ford Motor Company, Roche/Genentech, Goldman Sachs, Nok Nok Labs, Sway AI, US Soccer Federation, and more. You bring your unique background, and Align helps you turn it into impact.

## What makes Align different
  * Built for non-computer science majors.
  * Supportive cohort model.
  * Experiential edge.[USNews](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/internship-programs?_sort=rank&_sortDirection=asc)). You’ll also tackle project-rich courses that address industry needs.
  * Human-centric, responsible AI.


## How the Align program works
## AI specializations
Robotics and agent-based systems  
Build autonomous systems — warehouse robots, drones, arms — that perceive, plan, and act in dynamic environments. 
Machine learning  
Design, train, and deploy models for real-world needs, from risk prediction to recommendations, using modern ML pipelines. 
Computer vision  
Teach machines to “see” for healthcare imaging, autonomy, and geospatial analytics — classification, detection, and segmentation. 
Intelligent interaction  
Create text, speech, and multimodal interfaces (chatbots, copilots) using human-in-the-loop methods and evaluation. 
Knowledge management and reasoning  
Represent complex domains and reason under uncertainty with planning and probabilistic inference for trustworthy decisions.

## Learning outcomes
The Align MS in Artificial Intelligence will prepare you to meet graduate-level standards in computer science and AI via the academic bridge, then going on to: 
  * Understand representations, algorithms, and techniques used across the AI industry and academia and be able to apply and evaluate them in applications as well as develop your own. 
  * Understand the basic processes that an agent must perform, from perceiving its environment, making decisions on how to act and performing those actions, as well be able to develop and evaluate the technology that can be used to perform these processes. 
  * Understand and apply machine learning techniques to draw inferences from data and help automate the development of AI systems and components. 
  * Understand the various ways and reasons humans are integrated into mixed human-AI environments, whether it is to improve overall integrated system performance, improve AI performance, or influence human performance and learning. 
  * Understand the ethical concerns in developing responsible AI technologies. 
  * Model human behavior, develop human-AI systems, and evaluate their performance. 
  * Demonstrate knowledge of the use of AI algorithms and processes in one of the specialization areas: robotics and agent-based systems, vision, intelligent interaction, machine learning, and knowledge representation and reasoning.

## Student experience and support
### Student perspective: Rajen Aldis
Associate Director of Informatics Research at Cambridge Health Alliance
“I enjoyed bringing my code skills up to speed, and then I enjoyed transitioning to the mainstream master’s part of the program … I did a data science concentration, so I did the AI course and data mining courses. The friends that I had and the other people in Align, they were doing a lot of cool stuff. I found it admirable to see the resiliency of people. Folks had so much going on, but still found a way to devote themselves.”
