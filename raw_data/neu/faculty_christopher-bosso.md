## Courses
[Course catalog](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
[ "Food is universal. Everyone eats. Food is an easy entry point into conversations about social inequities. Even the least political person can understand injustices in the food system and be challenged to work to redress them." – Marion Nestle Food Systems and Public Policy ](http://catalog.northeastern.edu/course-descriptions/ppua/)
#### PPUA 5270
This course explores the policy dimensions of the food system. It starts from a broad perspective about the food system and concludes with considerations of local and regional responses to its perceived failures. Along the way we consider its policy drivers, whether the imperatives generated by global trade regimes or the constitutional rules embedded in the U.S. system of government. Topics will include domestic and international politics of agriculture and food, sources of and responses to problems of food security, urban food systems, the politics of nutrition, and food system resilience in the face of disruption. Our purpose is to develop a clearer understanding of how politics shapes “food policy” and how politics can be leveraged for a food system that is more sustainable, resilient, and equitable.
