#  Socio-ecological Dynamics, Plant Ecology, and the Science-policy Lab 
We examine socio-ecological plant systems that preserve biodiversity and foster resilience to a changing climate, including how plant population and community dynamics impact human well-being and management decision-making, and how those decisions feed back to influence ecosystem dynamics.

## People
  * ### [Gabriela Garcia](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/gabriela-garcia/)
Research in Gabriela Garcia’s group is positioned at the intersection of today’s biodiversity, food security, and climate crises. As shifting precipitation patterns and extreme events disrupt agroecosystem function and threaten farmer livelihoods, they advance a predictive framework for understanding how socio-ecological systems respond to disturbance. The group integrates ecological fieldwork, qualitative interview analyses, and large-scale […]
