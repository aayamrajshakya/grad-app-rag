## Concentrations
Students in the MS in Civil Engineering program have six concentrations from which to choose:
* * *
Construction Management
This program is intended for students interested in construction management and engineering or a closely related field. It includes required core courses primarily from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, complemented by electives in civil and environmental engineering and other departments such as mechanical and industrial engineering and business administration. Based on proven proficiency in given areas, students may waive certain core courses and replace them with alternate elective courses.

* * *
Data and Systems
This concentration is designed to prepare students to use new and emerging technologies in data analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence, as well as systems analysis (e.g., operations research, economics, system identification) and sensors to address problems in domains spanning all (traditional) civil and environmental engineering (CEE) areas. This is an umbrella program that serves all CEE disciplines by providing a solid foundation in modern programming languages such as Python and R, developing students’ data analytics skills, promoting a systems perspective, and, importantly, honing these in the context of data-driven CEE problem solving.
