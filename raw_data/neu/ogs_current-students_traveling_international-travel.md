  * If you are on a J-1 visa, this is on the bottom right of your DS-2019.


How long is my travel signature valid?
For current F/J Students and Scholars, an I-20 travel signature and DS-2019 travel endorsement are valid for 12-months
For those on J-1 Academic Training or F-1 Post-Completion OPT/STEM Extension require a new travel signature every 6-months.
Prior to major vacation periods, OGS often offers travel signature sessions that require pre-registration. After successful screening, you will receive your travel signature on the spot. If you wish attend a session, please bring your I-20/DS-2019 form and your nine-digit Northeastern identification number.

##  Social Media and Electronic Device Searches at a U.S. Port of Entry 
When entering the U.S., Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers have the authority to inspect travelers’ electronic devices such as phones, tablets, and laptops. These inspections may include viewing content stored on the device, including social media apps and messages. CBP may conduct searches without a warrant, and refusal to comply may affect your ability to enter the U.S. For details, see [CBP’s policy on electronic device searches](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices). You may also review the following resource from AILA: “Electronic Device Searches at U.S. Ports of Entry”: What You Need to Know”.
##  Travel Tips 
  * If you have completed OPT, Academic Training (AT), or your academic program, and are in a grace period, you will not be allowed back into the U.S. on your F-1 or J-1 visa.
  * Any family members traveling with you who have F-2 or J-2 visas will also need to carry the same documents. Please review the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) [tips for travel](https://studyinthestates.dhs.gov/2013/11/ask-a-dso-how-do-i-prepare-to-return-to-the-united-states-after-a-vacation).
  * If you plan to travel when your visa has expired, please see the [Renewing Your Visa](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/renewing-your-visa/) page.
  * It is highly recommended that you register your travel with the [University’s Travel Registry](https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobalsafety.northeastern.edu%2Ftravel-registry%2F&data=05%7C02%7Ca.hogan%40northeastern.edu%7C1a8d414646e94523298808dccb8c5b85%7Ca8eec281aaa34daeac9b9a398b9215e7%7C0%7C0%7C638609050895904768%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=IX7UqphRoYgKqER8jpIgK3thatSWQ8RUzYa3dyBeWeM%3D&reserved=0 "Original URL: https://globalsafety.northeastern.edu/travel-registry/.

####  [ I will renew my passport but my student visa is still valid and is in my old passport. What should I do? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/international-travel/#collapse-3)
When you travel, carry both the new passport and the old passport with your student visa if your country of nationality allows you to keep your old passport. If your country does not allow you to keep your old passport containing a valid F-1 or J-1 visa, you will need to apply for a new visa the next time you travel abroad.
####  [ I need to return home during a required term. How long can I be outside of the U.S.? ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/current-students/traveling/international-travel/#collapse-4)
A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1/J-1 status is by actively participating in classes in person. This includes students who are engaging in practical training (co-op, internships, clinical rotations, etc.). All students must also adhere to their college’s attendance and absenteeism policy. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1/J-1 student be absent from their courses for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1/J-1 status and your long-term academic goals. 
If you are unable to attend your classes in person, you may be advised to pursue a leave of absence from your studies.
