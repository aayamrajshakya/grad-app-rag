Program overview 
##  Launch your tech career 
The Align MSCS program gives you graduate-level training so you can apply computer science in your areas of expertise—or explore an entirely new career. Through Align, you’ll build skills in the core areas of CS. Then you’ll get to explore the junctions of CS and law, music, biology, business, physics, education, biomedical science or whatever interests you through projects as well as co-op and internship opportunities.
Full-time students typically complete the Align MSCS in 2.5 years. The program begins with a two-semester introductory sequence, which provides the foundational knowledge to ensure that students from non-technical backgrounds have the tools they need to succeed. The program also includes the opportunity for 4—8 months of paid, full-time work experience at a company or organization.
