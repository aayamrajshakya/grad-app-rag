The PhD is awarded to students who demonstrate high academic achievement and research competence in the fields of mechanical or industrial engineering. To earn a PhD, a student must complete an approved, rigorous program of advanced coursework and submit and defend an original dissertation of independent research. The mechanical and industrial engineering (MIE) department expects all successful doctoral candidates to show depth of knowledge and research innovation in their chosen field of specialization.
The MIE department admits applicants to the PhD program either directly after earning a suitable bachelor’s degree or after earning a master’s degree. Upon acceptance into the program, an applicant is designated as a doctoral student. This designation is changed to doctoral candidate upon successful completion of the doctoral qualifying examinations (both written and oral area exams) as well as all the required course work.
Unique Features
Located in downtown Boston, which facilitates tremendous collaborations with other nearby academic institutions, hospital facilities, and tech firms.
Conduct research alongside faculty in labs, research centers, and research institutes. Many faculty hold young investigator awards, other national recognitions, and are elected fellows of professional societies for contributions to the engineering profession.
The department has 12 collaborative research themes, including robotics, energy systems, sustainability & environmental protection, resilient & sustainable service systems, mechanics, human-technology integration and systems, materials for the future, intelligent manufacturing, networks and complex systems, and more.
Can be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate.
