#  Graduate Studies 
The Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering (MIE) offers comprehensive research and educational programs for both Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) students. Our cutting-edge and vibrant doctoral programs include PhDs in industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and an interdisciplinary PhD (housed in the College of Engineering).
Our MS degree programs are offered in both traditional mechanical and industrial engineering, and operations research, as well as in a variety of applied programs and concentrations. These extensive programs and concentrations allow for the selection of a degree that meets a wide variety of personal and professional goals. Students accepted into any of the MS programs in the MIE department can choose one of the three options: coursework only, MS project, or MS thesis. Students may pursue any program either on a full-time or part-time basis; however, certain restrictions may apply.
Our MS in Energy Systems and MS in Engineering Management degree programs are also available 100% online meeting needs of working professionals. Graduate certificates, in technical areas as well as business and leadership, are also available that can be combined with or taken in addition to the graduate degree giving further ability for students to personalize their education.
Graduate students can work with our world-renowned faculty to participate in research experience and will have opportunities to participate in the graduate cooperative education program. These experiences are tailored to help students achieve their career goals.

Learn about our experiential graduate mechanical and industrial engineering program for master’s and PhD students at Northeastern University, including interdisciplinary research opportunities and world-renown co-op. 
Vibrant Community
With over 1,800 graduate students, our graduate student body creates a vibrant community of peers from across the United States and the world. In addition, Northeastern’s urban campus, located in downtown Boston, facilitates tremendous collaborations with other nearby academic institutions, hospital facilities, and tech firms. Such natural and geographic resources provide greater influence on our students body to interact with world-class researchers and entities.
Graduate Research
Each year the department receives approximately $10 million annually in funding to pursue use-inspired and fundamental research in many emerging fields that support and enhance our degree programs. Our department also has more than 10 [research themes](https://mie.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/) of focus.

Graduate Fellowships
The department offers Graduate Fellowships to PhD and MS/PhD applicants. These prestigious Graduate Fellowships include integrated research and teaching to foster a comprehensive graduate education. All applicants are considered automatically for the fellowship program. It is strongly recommended that applicants interested in funding within the department via fellowships, research assistantships, and teaching assistantships take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE).
