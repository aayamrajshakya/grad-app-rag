There’s a new moon in town — sort of. 
The much-discussed 2025 PN7, dubbed Earth’s “second moon,” is officially a quasi-moon, according to [NASA](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/nasa-confirms-earth-now-two-213956357.html), which confirmed the designation this week. 
First spotted by researchers over the summer, the newly discovered rock isn’t a true moon but rather an asteroid that travels around the sun in near-lockstep with Earth — making it appear, from our perspective, as if it’s orbiting our planet.
But unlike the actual[Jacqueline McCleary](https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jacqueline-mccleary/), an observational cosmologist.
The celestial object belongs to the Arjuna asteroid group, a collection of “near-Earth objects” that move in resonance with Earth. Because 2025 PN7 is not gravitationally bound to our planet like the moon is, it’s not a “true” moon.
But according to McCleary, there’s no simple rule for what counts as a moon and what doesn’t. She says that astronomers have long quibbled about criteria — debating everything from size cutoffs to orbital stability.
