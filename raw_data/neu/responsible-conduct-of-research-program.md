#### Federal Agency Requirements
Who should take the RCR training?
NSF
Undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral research, faculty, and other senior/ key personnel to be supported by NSF awards. The RCR requirement flows down to all subawardees ([NSF RECR policy](https://www.nsf.gov/policies/responsible-research-conduct)).
NIH
Trainees, fellows, participants and scholars supported by any NIH training, career development award, research education grant and dissertation research grant. Plus as otherwise stated in funding opportunity announcements ([NIH Notice: NOT-OD-10-019](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/not-od-10-019.html)).
USDA
Program directors, faculty, undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and any staff participating in the research project must receive appropriate RCR training and oversight ([USDA Terms and Conditions](https://www.nifa.usda.gov/grants/regulations-and-guidelines/terms-conditions)).
NSF Awardees
All undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers supported by NSF financial assistance awards to conduct research on research grants submitted after January 4, 2010, must comply with the NSF training policy. Conferences, symposiums, workshops, and travel awards are exempt from this requirement. The NSF also refers to RCR as RECR (Responsible and Ethical Conduct of Research); however, they are the same training and are more commonly referred to as RCR
The CHIPS & Science Act, enacted in 2022, expanded RCR requirements for NSF research awards. Consistent with the act, beginning in 2023, Northeastern’s RCR requirements expanded to include all senior personnel (whether paid or unpaid) and specify the RCR curriculum to include:
  * Federal export control, disclosure, and reporting requirements
  * Mentor training and mentorship
  * Training to raise awareness of potential research security threats

#### Northeastern’s Policy
Background
The responsible conduct of research (RCR) is essential to good science. RCR promotes the aims of scientific inquiry, fosters a research environment that enables scientists to work together toward common goals and promotes public confidence in scientific knowledge and progress for the public good. However, there are several serious detrimental effects of research not being conducted ethically and responsibly. These include, for example, data fabrication and falsification of results which undermine the pursuit of valid knowledge by misleading scientists to accept and further study false hypotheses or unreliable data. Likewise, plagiarism and harassment negatively impact the research environment by harming respect and trust among scientists. Fraudulent or socially irresponsible research undercuts the public’s trust in and support for science.
For more than a decade, the National Institutes of Health has made training in RCR for students supported by training grants and individual fellowships a requirement. The National Science Foundation implemented a similar requirement, effective January 4, 2010, following Section 7009 of the “America Competes” Act. The NSF also refers to RCR as RECR (Response and Ethical Conduct of Research); however, the training program is the same. The USDA/NIFA was initially effective on their Research Terms and Conditions issued in February 2013.
Policy Statement
All Northeastern University undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, including short-term visitors, paid by NSF research awards subject to the America COMPETES Act, and individuals receiving support through applicable NIH training, career development award (individual or institutional), research education grant, or dissertation research grant, must participate in instructional programs in the Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR), which are consistent with the legal, regulatory, and ethical requirements established by regulatory agencies, funding sources, professional organizations, and the University’s Plan for Instruction in the Responsible Conduct of Research.
The CHIPS & Science Act, enacted in 2022, expanded RCR requirements for NSF research awards. Consistent with the act, beginning in 2023, Northeastern’s RCR requirements expanded to include all senior personnel (whether paid or unpaid) and specify the RCR curriculum to include:
  * Training to raise awareness of potential research security threats
  * Federal export control, disclosure, and reporting requirements
  * Mentor training and mentorship

#### **RCR Program Overview and Training Offerings:**
The Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) program operates from September to April during the academic year. Information and registration for all RCR workshops are available and listed below. All students and faculty are welcome, with priority given to those fulfilling sponsor agency requirements. Our program offers multiple training modalities. This serves as an excellent professional development opportunity for everyone, from students to postdocs to faculty, whether RCR training is required or you’re looking to enhance your research capabilities.
Participants can attend any combination of workshops without prerequisites to meet specific agency requirements or complete our full 8-hour certification program. The program covers critical professional competencies, including, but not limited to, research team management, effective communication and team building, responsible authorship, publication ethics, copyright and intellectual property, conflicts of interest management, mentorship development, research security, and export controls. These newer required subjects reflect current federal mandates and the evolving research compliance landscape. We ensure individuals required to complete RCR training can do so within six months of award or appointment.
CITI training remains an available resource; however, RCR credit for CITI training is typically accepted for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as those unable to attend in-person RCR workshops. Individuals at the Postdoctoral level and faculty are encouraged to utilize other modalities to complete any required RCR training.
Please see the available training modalities in the table below. Utilize the details and registration links to explore your options further, as each modality covers different subject matter.
Training Modality | Number of RCR Training Hours | Details and Registration Links

#### Tracking your RCR Training
Tracking Online RCR Training and Instruction
Online training completion is tracked through multiple systems for record-keeping. Training completed through Workday Learning (such as Research Security and Mentorship) is tracked via Workday reporting systems. Live virtual sessions are tracked through attendance data reports during the session. Once any online training component is completed, the records will be updated so that Northeastern maintains documentation of RCR training compliance. Individual researchers are also in the best position to provide updates regarding their training and are encouraged to provide updates towards the completion of the 7 RCR workshop hours to the Associate Director for Training and Learning to qualify for the Capstone workshop and receive a certificate of completion.
If students have completed online training within CITI, their training records will be automatically downloaded so that Northeastern will know that they’ve completed this component of the requirement.
Tracking In-Person RCR Training and Instruction
Attendance at all in-person workshops is recorded on-site during each session. Participation will be documented to ensure complete tracking of RCR training requirements and compliance status. Individual researchers are also in the best position to provide updates regarding their training and are encouraged to provide updates towards the completion of the 7 RCR workshop hours to the Associate Director for Training and Learning to qualify for the Capstone workshop and receive a certificate of completion.
Record & Retention
All students, faculty, and staff who complete any format of RCR training should keep a copy of their Certificate of Completion for their records. When RCR training is required by the grant, it is a best practice for the PI/college to maintain copies of the certificates for any students paid from applicable NIH, NSF, and USDA-NIFA grants.
#### Sample Language for grant proposal narratives related to RCR
Sample Language
The in-person Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) course is open to all Northeastern faculty and students. The RCR course is offered in Boston during the academic year beginning in September and continuing through April. The course is approximately eight hours long, with significant researcher facilitation and administrative support, and uses discussions and case studies to examine basic ethical and regulatory requirements for conducting research. RCR is a highly recommended “best practices” course for those desiring to deepen their knowledge of ethical research and responsible conduct. It is also an excellent professional opportunity for anyone interested in furthering a career in research. This course fulfills the National Science Foundation (NSF) and National Institutes of Health (NIH) requirements for formal RCR instruction. Topics covered include research misconduct; responsible authorship and publication; peer review and copyright; mentor-mentee relationships; lab safety; conflicts of interest and disclosure; foreign travel and international collaboration; data acquisition and management; grant stewardship; research security; export controls; and working with institutional regulatory bodies (i.e., IRB, IACUC, and IBC).
