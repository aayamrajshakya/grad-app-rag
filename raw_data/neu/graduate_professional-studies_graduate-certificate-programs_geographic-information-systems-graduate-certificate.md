2025-2026 Edition
## [2025-2026 Edition](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/)
A geographic information system (GIS) combines layers of data to give needed information on specific locations. Such a system can map environmental sensitivities or geological features or can report on how best to speed emergency personnel to an accident or crime scene. Current fields using GIS include healthcare, public safety, environmental management, transportation and operations technology, real estate, and public utilities.
The Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems program offers hands-on training, seeking to give students the necessary skills and understanding to apply GIS competently and effectively. As a result of the certificate curriculum, students should be well versed in GIS theory, have practical hands-on exposure to GIS software and hardware, understand the representation of data in both mapped and tabular forms, and know how to plan and construct spatial databases.
