#  Students Studying in The United States 
Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGA) help eligible F-1 and J-1 students to successfully participate in part-time teaching while performing world-class research. 
##  What is a Stipended Graduate Assistantship? 
Eligible F-1 and J-1 students in graduate programs may receive a Stipended Graduate Assistantships (SGA) through their academic department. These awards generally include a stipend, tuition remission, and health plan, and are considered “on-campus employment”. F/J students are eligible to work a maximum of 20-hours per week through their SGA and are not eligible for overload work. They are also not eligible to work in other on-campus positions while holding the SGA.
If you have a position on campus that is titled “Assistant” (e.g. Research Assistant, Teaching Assistant), but you are paid hourly through the Office of Student Employment, Graduate Assistantships & Fellowships, then you most likely do not have an SGA. Stipended Graduate Assistantships are a package offered through the department and you will receive a letter that outlines the details of the SGA.
In order to receive payment for your SGA, you must obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) through the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can learn more about applying for an SSN below.
Students with an SGA should also carefully [review all policies regarding on-campus employment. ](https://international.northeastern.edu/ogs/employment/on-campus-employment/f-1-on-campus-employment/)
For more specific information about receiving an SGA, please check with your Graduate School.
Notes for J-1 Students:
  * If your J-1 program sponsor is Fulbright or another organization other than Northeastern, you will need to request on-campus work permission (and any necessary authorization letters to apply for an SSN) from your J-1 program sponsor.
  * You must submit an SGA request for each academic year that you’re continuing on an SGA. SEVIS functionality only allows for authorization to be added for one year at at time, therefore you must submit each year to confirm you’re continuing with your assistantship.
