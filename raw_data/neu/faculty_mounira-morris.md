## Biography
Dr. Mounira Morris is an associate teaching professor and the lead for the M.Ed. in Higher Education Administration (HEA) program. Dr. Morris has held leadership roles in diversity, equity, inclusion and justice and student affairs across multiple higher education institutions, including Clark University, Allegheny College, and Earlham College. In these roles, she developed summer bridge and social support programs for first-generation students and students of color, organized dialogues for faculty, staff, and students on social justice, and served on multiple committees to address diversity, equity, inclusion and justice throughout all aspects of the student experience.

A scholar-practitioner, Dr. Morris recently co-authored the article, “Competencies Wanted: An Analysis of Enrollment Management Job Advertisements” focusing on the core competencies required among entry-and mid-level enrollment management positions. In addition to her lead faculty role in the M.Ed. in HEA curriculum, she serves as a dissertation chair in the Doctor of Education program.

She received her Doctor of Education from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. As someone who values service to the profession and community, Dr. Morris is an active member of NASPA-Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education and Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.
