## Overview
Northeastern’s Master of Science (MS) in Bioengineering equips students with the interdisciplinary education and real-world skills to meet the growing demand for professional engineers to lead in physiological processes in health and disease and improve methods for medical devices and treatments.
Our approach to focus on a specific concentration prepares graduates to excel with competitive expertise over graduate programs offering a general curriculum. Concentrations include: molecular, cell, and tissue engineering; biomechanics and mechanobiology; biomedical devices and bioimaging; and systems, synthetic, and computational bioengineering (see details below).
The MS in Bioengineering degree offers part- and full-time enrollment options and a selection of asynchronous online classes. Additionally, it can be completed in two semesters (fall and spring) without a cooperative education experience, or up to two years with cooperative education included.

## Innovative Curriculum - MS in Bioengineering
The Department strives to create an atmosphere of innovation and creativity that fosters excellence in instruction and research and provides a foundation for programs that drive forward the cutting edge of knowledge while establishing translational collaborations with clinical and industrial researchers.
Although this program is designed specifically for students with BS degrees in engineering or physics, students with a degree in biological or chemical sciences may apply. However, admission of students with different academic backgrounds will be contingent on the successful completion of undergraduate prerequisites required for the core courses of the program. This may require the student to take up to a year of undergraduate courses to fulfill the necessary requirements for enrolling in the core courses of the Bioengineering master’s (MS) curriculum.
Toggle Accordion  Interdisciplinary Program 
Bioengineering faculty have established highly interdisciplinary collaborations with faculty members from the College of Engineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, Biology, Chemistry, Physical Therapy, and more.
Toggle Accordion  Flexible Options 
Students select from [four concentrations](https://catalog.northeastern.edu/graduate/engineering/bioengineering/bioengineering-msbioe/#curriculumtext), with related [research areas](https://bioe.northeastern.edu/coe-research/research-areas/), a thesis option, project option, or course-only option.
Concentrations develop deep expertise in an area of particular interest and encourages individual research through a one-semester master’s project or two-semester master’s thesis in one of the following research areas.
The MS in Bioengineering offers part- and full-time enrollment options and a selection of asynchronous online classes.

Toggle Accordion  Location 
The Boston campus is located directly adjacent to the world-renowned Longwood Medical Area in Boston with the world’s prestigious hospitals, and nearby Cambridge, a hub for pharmaceutical research, providing an excellent opportunity for students to combine engineering, medicine, and biology through education, research, and professional experience as part of Northeastern’s top-ranked cooperative education program.
Toggle Accordion  Research Opportunities 
The MS in Bioengineering provides significant opportunities for student [research](https://bioe.northeastern.edu/coe-research/), working with accomplished faculty. With a premier location in downtown Boston, research in the department leverages the wealth of collaborations with neighboring universities, hospitals, medical centers and industry.
Bioengineering research enjoys strong support from multiple government agencies. NIH has historically led all other agencies in budget increases, consuming today roughly 50% of all non-defense research spending. Healthcare spending expanded from 6% of the GDP in 1960 to 15% in 2000 and has climbed to 20% in 2020, in part due to the aging of the baby-boom generation. The COVID-19 pandemic was another chief driver of healthcare needs.
Biomedical advances are increasingly dependent on quantitative approaches as exemplified by bioengineering, and the general perception is that government support for this research will continue to rise (or, at the very least, erode more slowly than other areas). The energy crisis and global climate change threats have also fostered interdisciplinary research across bioengineering with other fields such as biofuel cells, bio-batteries, bioremediation, bio-carbon sequestration, etc., and many agencies such as EPA, DOE, DOD and DARPA support these research directions.
Toggle Accordion  Learning Outcomes

Toggle Accordion  Graduate Certificates 
Over 15 [graduate certificates](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/?level=Graduate%20Certificate) are available to provide students the opportunity to develop a specialization in an area of their choice. Certificates can be taken in addition to or in combination with a master’s degree, or provide a pathway to a master’s degree in Northeastern’s College of Engineering. Master’s programs can also be combined with a Gordon Engineering Leadership certificate. Students should consult with their faculty advisor regarding these options.
#### Gordon Institute of Engineering Leadership
Students may complete a Master of Science in Bioengineering in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Leadership](https://coe.northeastern.edu/academic-programs/cert-gel/). Students must apply and be admitted to the Gordon Engineering Leadership Program in order to pursue this option. The program requires fulfillment of the 16-semester-hour-curriculum required to earn the Graduate Certificate in Engineering Leadership, which includes an industry-based challenge project with multiple mentors. The integrated 33-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 17 hours of advisor-approved bioengineering technical courses.
#### Engineering Business Certificate
Students may complete a Master of Science in Bioengineering with a concentration in biomedical device and bioimaging in addition to earning a Graduate Certificate in Engineering Business. Students must apply and be admitted to the Galante Engineering Business Program in order to pursue this option. _The program requires the applicant to have earned or be in a program to earn a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Northeastern University._ The integrated 32-semester-hour degree and certificate will require 16 semester hours of the bioengineering core courses and 16 semester hours from the outlined business-skill curriculum. The coursework, along with participation in co-curricular professional development elements, earn the Graduate Certificate in [Engineering Business](https://mie.northeastern.edu/academics/graduate-studies/cert-enbu/).

## Program Goals
Career Outlook
Bioengineering is a growing sector of the engineering profession. The aging of the U.S. population and the nationwide focus on health issues will help drive demand for better medical devices and equipment designed by biomedical engineers. Additionally, an increased concern for cost-effectiveness will boost demand for biomedical engineers, particularly in pharmaceutical and device manufacturing and related industries.
Employment of bioengineers and biomedical engineers is projected to grow 7% from 2023 to 2033, faster than the average for all occupations. The median annual wage for bioengineers and biomedical engineers was $100,730 in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
