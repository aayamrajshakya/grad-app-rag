The Master of Science in Project Management is accredited by the PMI Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC). The GAC Accredited Program seal is a mark of Project Management Institute, Inc.
In October of 2021, the Master of Science in Project Management accreditation was re-affirmed for the maximum five-year accreditation cycle (originally accredited in 2009) by the [PMI Global Accreditation Center for Project Management Education Programs (GAC)](https://www.pmi.org/), the world's leading association for project management professionals. Accreditation is achieved by meeting the GAC’s rigorous standards, which include an assessment of program objectives and outcomes, a review of onsite and online resources, evaluations of faculty and students, and proof of continuous improvements in the area of project management.
Graduates of our GAC-accredited program are granted a substantial 12-month reduction credit toward the experience requirement when they complete an application for any PMI certification. This means that those applying for the PMI certification will only need 24 months of project management experience, instead of 36 months as outlined by GAC. This new [benefit](https://www.pmi.org/global-accreditation-center/students/student-certification-requirements) applies retroactively to our program’s initial accreditation date of 2009.
